These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Sure, I'd be interested in the pool, but you probably weren't intending to include me in it.  Please re-check your e-mail for the appropriate Brady.

Thanks a bunch!

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Ladies and Gentlemen ... wear Leather.
If I could offer you only one tip for improving your life, wearing leather
would be it.

The long term benefits of leather have been proved by serious bikers over
many highways and many years, whereas wearing something unreliable like
shorts and flipflops means you will experience a trip to the emergency room.
There, uncaring nurses will scrub gravel out of your wounds, and doctors
will dispense ineffective painkillers and meaningless advice ... like
telling you to trade that "murdercycle" in for a Camry.

Bullshit. I will dispense some real advice right now:

Enjoy the power and beauty of your ride; If you don't already; you can fully
enjoy it by doing block-long smokey burnouts in the parking lot at the local
drive-in. Pass slower bikers on the right inside of the uphill curve when
they will not let you pass to the left.

Trust me, in 20 years you'll look back at the photos of you and your pals on
your bikes and recall in a way you can't grasp now how much fun you had and
how fabulous you really looked hauling ass down the highway dressed in
leather.

Leather is as sexy as you imagine.

Don't worry about what your Mom thinks; or worry about what others think.
Know that worrying about what other people think is as effective as trying
to scratch your nose in a blinding hailstorm at 80 m.p.h. with a full- face
helmet and winter gloves on. The real troubles in your life are apt to be
Volvo stationwagons, driven by some dipstick talking into his cell phone or
doing her makeup; the kind that blindside you at 4 PM on some urban roadway
and then claim you crashed into THEM.

Do one thing everyday that scares other drivers... Lanesplit.

Ladies, learn to ride and then ride often. Nothing is more of an equalizer
than a woman, dressed in leather, astride her own machine. Gentlemen,
respect the ladies who ride, for they could very well have been the rider
that waxed your fanny in the mountian curves you just came through.

Sing into your helmet. Use mouthwash first. Keep mints handy.

Don't be reckless with other people's bikes, especially if you don't have
insurance. Don't put up with people who mess with yours.... in fact, beat
them with a chain.

Ride Fast.

Don't waste your money on chrome, or fancy paintjobs; spend it on racing or
partying. Sometimes you're fast, sometimes you're slow. Sometimes you're
hungover. The ride is long, and in the end, a cold beer tastes pretty damn
good.

Remember the good rides you've had, forget the cuts and bruises.

Watch cage drivers to not signal before pulling into your lane. Be alert for
brainless cage drivers to pull an opposing left turn in front of you. May
the fool on four wheels in front of you have working brake lights.

Try to wear out the sides of your tires before the middle.... if you succeed
in doing this, tell me how.

Keep your oil changed, throw away old traffic citations.

Enjoy your bike, use it every way you can...don't be afraid of it, or what
other people think of it, it's the greatest instrument of pleasure you'll
ever own, not counting porn sites and a fast modem.

Take chances.

Don't feel guilty if you ride faster than the posted limit ...the most
interesting people I know didn't know at 22 how to ride conservatively, all
the most interesting 40 year olds I know still don't.

Get plenty of saddle time.

Be kind to your passengers, you'll miss them if they fall off.

Maybe you'll crash, maybe you won't, maybe you'll have surgery, maybe you
won't, maybe you'll ride a cruiser off a cliff doing 40, maybe you'll get a
new motocrosser for your 75th birthday ...whatever you ride, don't
congratulate yourself too much - your choices are 90% foreign, 10% domestic;
so are everyone else's.

Wrench... even if you have nowhere to do it but in your hotel room.

Do not read American motorcycle magazines, they will only make you wish
you'd bought a British one instead. Read British motorcycle magazines and
laugh at how the brits laugh at americans. Stay away from German motorcycle
magazines, they are too serious and difficult to read.

Read the owner's manual, even though you won't remember any of it.

Get to know your brake pads, you never know when they'll be gone for good.
Remember, brake pads let you stop. Be nice to your tires; they are your link
to the pavement and the things most likely to save your butt from a nasty
highside.

Understand that mechanics comes and mechanics go, but for a precious
talented few you should pay them well and buy them sixpacks. Work hard to
bridge the gaps in geography and lifestyle because the older your bike gets,
the more you'll need the mechanic who worked on it when it was young and
still not paid off.

Ride in New York City once, but leave before you get killed; ride in
Northern California whenever possible, but leave a plausible excuse when
calling in sick for work. Ride in the Ozarks and learn the trick of the
curve. Ride the Blue Ridge Parkway and learn to be smooth. Ride through
Deals Gap and live to tell others about it. Stop and watch others ride
through Deals Gap and applaud when others do it well.

Do lurid wheelies.

Accept certain inalienable truths: prices will rise, traffic will get worse,
you too will get old, and when you do you'll fantasize that when you were
young, gasoline was cheap, the highway patrol couldn't catch you, and Harley
owners weren't all yuppies.

Respect your rev-limiter.

Don't expect anyone else to see your bike unless it has really loud pipes.

Maybe your bike has a big gas tank, maybe a smaller one; but remember,
either way you'll have to make bathroom stops.

Stop and offer help to the stranded motorcyclist along the open road, for
the next you come along could very well be yourself.

Don't mess too much with your carburetors, or by the time your done, you'll
be walking home and your pipes will be blue.

Be careful whose advice you buy, and save your receipts. Don't take advice
from those who supply it for free, especially if they own a Britbike.

Motorcycle restoration is a form of self-torture. Doing it is a way of
pulling the past from the dustbin, degreasing it, painting over the rusty
parts and dumping way more money into it than it's worth. Indian restoration
is a truely refined ailment that is only cured by death or an unlimited bank
account.

But trust me on the leather...

Oklahoma University Athletic Director Joe Castiglione announced today that
due to recent developments, the renovations at Owen Field are well ahead of
schedule and will come in under costs. Seems over 71,000 fans shit a brick
during the fourth quarter of the bedlam football game, providing the
necessary materials to begin work right away.

      Mind machines are tools for gently inducing a calm, centered, and euphoric
      state. They produce psychedelic mandala like patterns on the back of your
      eyelids and soothe your senses with drum like sound pulses. Although immensely
      pleasurable and entertaining, they are not toys. Many helping professionals
      in the fields of medicine and psychology currently use mind machines as
      adjunct treatments for their patients and clients. <br>

      All of us are bombarded every day by noises and sounds that have a deleterious
      effect on our brain and well being. Whether in the classroom, office or
      living room, our ears and brain constantly have to work hard to "tune out"
      these sounds in order to focus in on family, studies, or the task at hand.
      These unique music CDs provide an environment in which children and adults
      can think, learn, rest or sleep. Additionally, this music is stimulating
      the brain through the broad spectrum of frequencies and the structure of
      the music. <b><font color="#CC0000">Short Supply </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><font color="#CC0000">$15.95

Thanks for the info.  Our wills and Larry's  trust were prepared by an
estate attorney; there is a by-pass trust set up for me that involves the
"in excess of taxable amount"..reason I wanted the info.  With market the
way it is now and the amount going up each year, I don't think I will plan
on much from that.  MOM

I have to manually redraft for this to pull through, and unfortunately I do need the deal number. Hope it's not too much trouble.

Thanks!

Bryant split the deal so that Aug is under Georgia-Pacific and Sep is under Domtar.  So you should see it if you draft for Domtar for Sep.  If not, please let me know.  Unfortunately, I don't think Bryant wrote the deal number down.  But we can find it if necessary.

Hi Darron,

I noticed that you changed the term date on this deal. However, I didn't see it come through on the Domtar Industries side. Is this supposed to be charged to them again for September???

tEXas tailgatES talk

We welcomed the passing game to the 2001 season Saturday night
at the erector set they call Robertson Stadium. As I watched
the game from the stands, I heard some complaints from the Texas
fans around me. I do not, and will not, ever understand how a
team you support can be 3-0, winning those 3 games by an average
score of 46-15, be ranked in the top 5 in both major polls,
and be in contention for a national title, yet still have
fans unhappy. Do I think the team played perfect Saturday night?
No. Do I think they have things to work on? Yes. Was I ecstatic
that Texas put half of a hundred on the scoreboard against an
opponent on the road? You bet. Do I think this team is improving
every week? Absolutely.

53-26

This game was like just about every game played this weekend- sloppy.
Penalties and missed opportunities were present for both teams early.
The superior talent and depth proved to be the difference in this game.
The Longhorns simply are a better team than UH is right now, and that
showed. Whatever you might think of the Athletic Department and
Administration of UH (I'm right there with you), their football team is
well coached and plays tough. Chris Simms looked like the man-child
everyone was expecting from day 1. He finished the night a cool 20-35
for 311 yards and 3 touchdowns. He was picked off once, put UH got
nothing out of it. Some passes were dropped and another touchdown pass
to Tony Jeffrey was ruled incomplete, but replays later showed it was
a catch. He looked off receivers well, once on the 92-yard t.d. pass
to B.J. Johnson, scrambled when he had to, and really only made 1 or 2
bad decisions. The passing game has arrived. It is widely known that
the most improvement in a team is from game 1 to game 2. That was game
1 for the passing game. The I-Train was a wrecking ball. Williams had
103 yards and 2 touchdowns on 19 carries, and did not see the field in
the 4th quarter. He gave way to Benson, who racked up 74 yards and a
score on 14 carries. That's almost 5 ? yards per carry for the game.
Most impressive was the 3rd and short yardage situations, where Texas
fans have cringed in the past. Each time it was 2nd or 3rd and short,
the 'horns lined up in their 2 tight end set, and everyone in the
stadium knew what the play was and where it was going. It still worked.
5 ? yards per carry. Statistically, the defense has had better days.
They gave up 432 yards and 26 points. Some points of concern are the
lack of a consistent pass rush and some sloppy tackling, but the rest
must be laid at the feet of UH.  The Cougars had an excellent game plan
for Texas, and had 2 weeks to implement it. This was their OU game. They
had 2 games of film on Texas, who had only one (with no relevance, since
it was of Rice and their wishbone atack, that Texas hasn't used in 30 years).
Houston played lights out in the 1st half.  Two things coaches must do
are get their team prepared for the game and adjust to the opponent at
the half. Texas led 20-14 at the half. At the end of the 3rd quarter it
was 33-14. The Texas coaches fixed the immediate problem and stopped Houston
when it had to.  Like I said earlier, the biggest improvement for a team
is from game 1 to game 2. This was game 1 for defending the wide-open
offense.
________________________________________________________________

Texas Tech
6:00 pm   Fox Sports

This should be a fun one, folks. Tech has a chip on their shoulder
because they think they let one get away last year in Lubbock when
Texas walked out of their with a win, 29-17. Texas Tech comes in
2-0 after beating that bully North Texas, who they had previously
split the last 4 meetings with. This is about as one sided a rivalry
as it gets, with Texas leading the 50 games played 37-13. The Red
Raiders have a solid quarterback in Kliff Kingsbury, and a great
playmaker in safety Kevin Curtis. If they could block someone
offensively and stop the run on defense, they could be pretty good.
It's not happening here. Eat a big lunch, because the way these
teams throw the ball, and the way Tech's offensive line blocks,
expect a lot of incompletions and holding penalties. It's going
to be a long night.

INFORMATION FOR TICKET HOLDERS: Expect long lines and delays at
stadium gates, which will open two (2) hours prior to kickoff in
order to accommodate sellout crowds. Police officers are scheduled
to patrol the stadium block the day and night prior to the games.
An increased number of security officers are scheduled to man each
gate. For more information about the new restrictions click here:

http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=52

Don't forget, the worlds largest Tailgate Party starts at 3:00 PM
at the Alumni Center.


_______________________________________________________________________
We are 1 week away from the Red River War. I will include all of the
events that are happening in next week's email. The link to all of
the Texas/OU weekend is below:

http://www.dallastexasexes.org/

If you are interested in riding the bus from Austin to Dallas for
the game, please click below:

http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=54

The tailgate for Oklahoma State is going to be (tentatively) in the
parking lot near the stadium.  The tailgate for Missouri is going
to be (tentatively) at Spanky's Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn in
Columbia. More information is on the way:

http://www.texasexes.org/chapters/TexasTailgates.html

___________________________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Kickoff has been set for the OU game. 2:30 pm on ABC.

* Chris Simms' 92 yd touchdown pass to B.J. Johnson was the longest
of Simms career. The previous best was a 70 yarder to Johnson last
year (A&M).

* Texas is 26-0 under Mack Brown when they out rush their opponent.

* D.D. Lewis recovered the 9th fumble of his career in the 4th quarter
against UH, tying him for the all-time lead with Tim Campbell (1975-79)
and Oscar Giles (1987-90).

* Look for Derrick Johnson to be starting soon. Bam Bam came off of
the bench in the 3rd quarter and had an immediate impact, with 6
tackles/4 solo. He finished 3rd on the team in tackles for the game.

* Texas is 3-0 for the 1st time since 1994.

Around the Conference:
* The Aggies pulled off the Red/White/Blue decks for the game against
O.S.U. on Saturday.  It was quite a site, and very impressive. They
beat Oklahoma State 21-7, and host Notre Dame this weekend.

* OU will end its 3-week layoff as they host Kansas State this weekend.
The Sooners were off on September 22nd, and postponed their Sept. 15th
game with Tulsa to Nov. 24th. It will be interesting to see how they
come out. K-State seems to be hitting on all cylinders as they
annihilated New Mexico State 65-0. They led 50-0 at the half.

* Baylor is off to its best start since 1996. The Bears beat New Mexico
in OT 16-13 on Saturday. They are 2-0.

* Iowa State is also 2-0. The Cyclones beat Ohio 31-28 on Ennis
Haywood's 219 yards rushing. They host Baylor this weekend.

* The Big XII went 8-2 this weekend; with 2 teams idle (OU, Mizzou).
The only 2 losses came in conference play, OSU to A&M, and Kansas to
Colorado. The rest of the league went 6-0 in out of conference play.

Take Care. See you all this weekend.

I am sure you will be fine, but I guess everybody should be on pins and
needles.  You don't think they would eliminate any of the trading function,
do you?  How is the mood today?  I know my colleagues at EOL are pissed,
upset, nervous and sad.

Let me know if you hear anything good.

Darron:
I saw your name in the audit as changing a price on Cross Timbers deal 434968 for Jan 01.  The note in the terms tab says that the deal was triggered at 8.65, so you changed it from NWPL.Rockies + 0.025 to a fixed 8.65.  I spoke to Cross Timbers and they said they did not trigger this deal.  They said the price should remain at index + 0.025.  Can you confirm this price for me?  I'm showing a $40k adjustment that Cross Timbers does not.

Thanks,
Megan

Beck's prime gets my vote.

Should we try 11:30 or so to beat the rush?  If not, 12 is good for me.

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

That is fucking hilarious.  It would be even funnier if it had been you that got kicked out instead of me...I have already talked to the bartender and he understands that in the future, we pour our drinks in the bathroom, not right in front of stadium personnel...Also, next year - he is sitting with you!

   Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the
   great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was
   going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

      Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be
   a
      little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
      works
      best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest
   somewhere
      around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
      Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese
   place
      in 2
      Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

Question for NetCo employees:
The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.
Wanted to get a preliminary need analysis...

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Subject:	Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Hi Darren,

Heartland has been calling the trading desk looking for the confirmation on the above referenced deal. We haven't
sent it out because it was flagged as Pending you on Monday's credit report.  Can you please let us know as soon as possible 
about the credit status of this trade so we can get the confirm out?  

Thanks,
Diane

Twister - just want to confirm with you...the one payment for this...does that payment correspond to the three partial terminations, or all five (three partial plus two full) ?

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines In Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=
ty --- Firm Will Pay Debt, Keep Cash Cushion
By Wall Street Journal staff reporters John R. Emshwiller, Rebecca Smith an=
d Jathon Sapsford

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available bank cred=
it lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strength and liqu=
idity.=20
Enron will use part of the money to offer to redeem about $1.85 billion of =
outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- according to a=
 person familiar with the matter, with the remainder providing the energy c=
oncern with a cash cushion. Some observers believe the move is a pre-emptiv=
e step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidity should its access =
to bank lines be interrupted. The person also said Enron was talking to its=
 banks about a new, multibillion-dollar credit line.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But, "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last =
few days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," s=
aid an Enron spokesman. In a statement, the company's new chief financial o=
fficer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we are mak=
ing it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than adequate=
 liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitments."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading concern in the past 10 days. Enron is the natio=
n's largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all e=
lectricity and natural-gas trades. Yesterday, for example, Enron was involv=
ed in about $4 billion of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. Last week, it=
 reported a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder =
equity of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange =
Commission is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transaction=
s it did with entities connected to its former chief financial officer, And=
rew S. Fastow, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as one rating agency, Fitch, pu=
t Enron on review for a possible downgrade, while another, Standard & Poor'=
s, changed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investor=
s Service already has said it is looking at a possible downgrade of Enron. =
In order to fall below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have t=
o fall several notches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment-grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. At 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enro=
n was down six cents at $16.35.=20
Liquidity is a key issue for Enron, which handles energy-trading volumes mo=
re than triple its next-biggest competitor, American Electric Power Co. Enr=
on's EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform has transacted more than $=
884 billion of trades since it was created in November 1999.=20
The company's wildly successful wholesale unit has been dragged down by und=
erperforming assets elsewhere in the company, chiefly the approximately $6.=
5 billion of international assets such as its Dabhol power project in India=
. Raising cash and retiring debt largely is a timing issue. The cash needs =
of its trading operation are immediate; it takes time to sell assets, parti=
cularly in today's slower economy.=20
The company also is suffering from a string of disclosure controversies tha=
t have damaged its credibility, particularly in connection with its dealing=
s with Mr. Fastow, the former chief financial officer. Internal documents r=
elated to one of the Fastow partnerships disclose that Enron also did as mu=
ch as hundreds of millions of dollars of business with an entity connected =
to another company official, who has since left Enron. While Enron disclose=
d its Fastow-related transactions in SEC filings, a computerized search of =
the SEC's database of public filings produced no reference to this other em=
ployee-related entity known as Chewco.=20
Chewco was established in 1997 "with approximately $400 million in capital =
commitments" to buy an interest in Enron assets, according to one of the pa=
rtnerships documents. The document didn't further specify what assets were =
purchased, and it didn't disclose the financial impact of the transactions =
for either Chewco or Enron. Chewco was being run by Michael Kopper, a manag=
ing director in Enron's Global Equity Markets Group, according to the docum=
ent.=20
Enron, which has maintained that its complex financial transactions with em=
ployee-related entities were legal and properly disclosed, didn't have any =
comment regarding its dealings with Chewco.=20
Mr. Kopper, who Enron says left the company this year to focus on helping t=
o run the Fastow-related partnerships, didn't return phone calls. A person =
at his office in Houston yesterday said Mr. Kopper was traveling. In respon=
se to questions about Chewco, an Enron spokesman would say only that "Micha=
el Kopper was never an executive officer of Enron." Mr. Fastow repeatedly h=
as declined interview requests. He severed his relationships with the partn=
erships in July.=20
This statement is an apparent reference to SEC disclosure regulations regar=
ding related-party transactions. Under SEC rule S-K, a company has to repor=
t any transaction that exceeds $60,000 and involves "any director or execut=
ive officer." By contrast, Mr. Fastow, as CFO, would have fallen into that =
category, but Mr. Kopper, as managing director of a business unit, presumab=
ly wouldn't have.=20
However, reporting guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Bo=
ard seems to have a broader definition, one that might include Mr. Kopper. =
According to FAS Statement 57, a related-party transaction involves a "mate=
rial" piece of business between the company and a member of management. The=
 statement defines management as directors, top officers, vice presidents i=
n charge of major business units and "other persons who perform similar pol=
icy-making functions. Persons without formal titles may also be members of =
management."

Officials at Enron Corp., whose unusual transactions with its chief financi=
al officer are under regulatory scrutiny, have steadily sold sizable amount=
s of their holdings of company stock as the share price has fallen this yea=
r.=20
Corporate officials had sold 1.8 million shares valued at about $106 millio=
n through July, as the stock fell to less than $45 a share from $83 at the =
start of the year. Since July, the stock has plummeted an additional 63% to=
 $16.35, including a 50% plunge since the beginning of last week.
Kenneth Lay, chief executive of the Houston energy-trading company, cashed =
in shares for $25.7 million so far this year, usually in transactions paire=
d with options exercises. He sold 429,614 shares, leaving him with some 2.8=
 million shares as of July, the latest data available on his sales, accordi=
ng to Thomson Financial/Lancer Analytics.=20
The dollar amount for his 2001 sales is approaching the total for all Mr. L=
ay's sales of Enron shares for 2000, which reached $30.7 million. In 1999, =
he sold shares for a total of $26 million.=20
In Houston, an Enron spokeswoman declined to comment on the figures, saying=
 the company doesn't keep a running tally of stockholdings by corporate off=
icials. Enron also wouldn't comment on the number of options held by compan=
y insiders and called the sales "a personal decision." Many sales by Enron =
insiders were concurrent with options exercises or sales followed soon afte=
r option exercises.=20
Strong selling by company officers and directors amid share-price declines =
should raise red flags for investors, says Jonathan Moreland, research dire=
ctor of InsiderInsights.com, who uses insider-trading data to zero in on in=
vestment ideas.=20
Among other insiders selling during the year, Kenneth Rice, former chairman=
 and CEO of Enron's broadband unit, sold shares for $23.7 million. Mr. Rice=
 has sold 456,966 shares of the 1.5 million shares he was listed as owning =
in Enron's March proxy filing. Former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey Skillin=
g -- who resigned in August -- sold 160,000 shares for $9.8 million during =
the year. In March, Mr. Skilling owned 1.9 million shares.=20
Messrs. Rice and Skilling couldn't be reached to comment.=20
Overall, Enron's insiders were busier selling shares last year, when they s=
old 5.8 million shares for about $449 million. During 1999, insiders sold 3=
.4 million shares for $123.1 million.=20
Since December 1999, only one Enron executive has reported buying company s=
hares. The buyer was Andrew Fastow, who was ousted during the week as Enron=
's chief financial officer after the company disclosed it was under a Secur=
ities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial ties between the=
 company and Mr. Fastow.=20
Mr. Fastow reported purchasing 10,000 Enron shares in August at $36.98 each=
, or a total of $369,800. Today, those shares are valued at $163,500, based=
 on Enron's stock price of $16.35 in 4 p.m. New York Stock Exchange composi=
te trading. After the purchase, Mr. Fastow owned 110,586 shares, Thomson Fi=
nancial/Lancer Analytics says.=20
Enron said Mr. Fastow wasn't available to comment.=20
On Monday, a New York law firm filed suit in U.S. District Court in Houston=
, alleging that Enron misrepresented its performance by failing to disclose=
 problems with its broadband division and failing to properly write down th=
e value of investments in limited partnerships managed by Mr. Fastow. The s=
uit, which seeks class-action status, also says Enron insiders sold $73 mil=
lion of their own Enron holdings during parts of 2000 and 2001.

Credit Markets
Enron's Financial Troubles Reverberate to Bonds With Poor Liquidity and Cre=
dit-Rating Concerns

NEW YORK -- Enron Corp.'s bonds have held up better than its battered stock=
 amid escalating financial woes at the energy-trading powerhouse.=20
Not for long, some bond traders say.
In trading yesterday, the Houston company's five-year bond, a $250 million =
issue due in July 2006 carrying a coupon of 6.4%, was quoted at 82 cents on=
 the dollar, down from a bid of 88 late Wednesday, and representing a 16% d=
rop during the past two weeks.=20
That is far less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct.=
 16 disclosure of a $1.01 billion charge linked to soured investments, resu=
lting in a $618 million third-quarter loss. But the fall in the bond's pric=
e translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage points above bellwether U.S. gove=
rnment bonds, which is a widening from about three percentage points two we=
eks ago. Although Enron still is an investment-grade credit, that kind of "=
spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with a credit rating of singl=
e B or lower.=20
Enron sought to assure the markets that its finances were sound, disclosing=
 late yesterday that it drew down more than $1 billion on its bank credit l=
ines to shore up its finances. Yet even as Enron was tapping its lifeline, =
investors were finding it difficult to trade big blocks of Enron bonds. Yes=
terday's 82 bid, for instance, was for a block of less than $2 million in b=
onds, a small percentage of a typical trade.=20
Fueling the uncertainty surrounding Enron were fears that credit-rating con=
cerns will lower ratings on Enron debt after it recently conceded a slew of=
 troubles, including losses, a Securities and Exchange Commission investiga=
tion, and the sudden resignation of its chief financial officer.=20
"Even at these levels, there's very little buying interest," said Harold Ri=
vkin, a principal at distressed-debt trader H. Rivkin & Co. in Princeton, N=
.J.=20
In one sign of the ripple effects, the price investors pay to protect thems=
elves from losses on Enron debt was surging. The cost of a "default swap" -=
- in which an investor pays another investor to take a chunk of debt at fac=
e value in the event of default -- rose to 10% of the size of the credit be=
ing insured. That was up from 8% a day earlier, and more than holders of Lu=
cent Technologies Inc. debt had to pay at the height of that technology com=
pany's troubles earlier during the year.=20
Even with its woes, Enron remains an investment-grade company. Most credit-=
rating agencies rate Enron's senior unsecured debt at several notches above=
 the noninvestment-grade level.=20
Yet Fitch said yesterday it put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possib=
le downgrade, following a similar move by Moody's Investors Service last we=
ek. (Standard & Poor's, a division of McGraw Hill Cos., stopped short of pu=
tting the company on its Creditwatch list, opting instead to revise its lon=
g-term ratings outlook to "negative," citing concerns about the company's f=
inancial flexibility.)=20
Meanwhile, the weak bond prices are a sign that the markets are bracing for=
 the worst. "These are investment-grade bonds that are migrating toward dis=
tressed levels," said Glenn Reynolds, an analyst at Credit Sights Inc., an =
independent fixed-income research firm in New York. "They aren't distressed=
 yet, but they are headed in that direction."=20
If Enron's credit ratings fall, it would have implications far beyond the c=
ompany's ability to raise money. For an energy trader, a credit downgrade s=
ends a signal to other participants in crucial markets about its ability to=
 make good on its commitments.=20
Enron makes markets in a variety of commodities. Though it is best known fo=
r trading electricity and natural gas, the company also is a huge force in =
the markets for other commodities such as lumber, metals, bandwidth capacit=
y and steel. As a market maker matching buyers and sellers, Enron handles a=
bout a quarter of all the trading in the nation's energy and gas markets.=
=20
Enron's credit-worthiness is hugely important. The better its credit rating=
, the cheaper it can hedge, or offset, its positions in all these commoditi=
es markets through derivatives and pass on savings to customers. Without th=
at credit rating, the cost of this high-margin, high-volume business starts=
 to rise. A derivative is an instrument whose value is linked to, or derive=
d from, that of an underlying security or asset, such as a stock, bond or c=
ommodity.=20
"Even if the company does retain its investment-grade rating, the perceptio=
n that this might be at risk will start to affect their core businesses," s=
aid Mr. Reynolds at Credit Sights Inc. "Any prudent risk [manager] at Enron=
's counterparties" -- any institution on the other end of a financial agree=
ment with Enron -- "is going to be examining their exposure to Enron, and l=
ooking for ways to minimize it or offset it," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
To be sure, Enron, despite its recent woes, remains a strong company, credi=
t analysts said. "I don't think anyone's seriously thinking that this is a =
company that would ever default," Mr. Reynolds said.=20
"So far, our research shows that their counterparties and their banks are s=
ticking with them," said Ron Barone, managing director of Standard & Poor's=
 utility energy project finance group. "No one has cut credit lines or aske=
d for additional collateral that we have identified. And customers have pub=
licly stated that it's business as usual."=20
Yet analysts say the arrival of distressed-debt traders on the scene could =
make life more difficult for Enron and its management. Traders expect Enron=
's new Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon and Chairman Kenneth Lay to =
make the rounds of Wall Street next week, meeting with rating agencies, deb=

asury, corporate and agency debt issues.=20
At 4 p.m. EDT, the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was up 13/32 point, or $=
4.0625 per $1,000 face value, at 103 20/32. Its yield fell to 4.537% from 4=

The 30-year Treasury bond's price was up 22/32 point at 101 11/32 to yield =
5.284%, down from 5.330% Wednesday.=20
Fed policy makers are slated to meet on Nov. 6. Also providing support for =

Heard on the Street
Most Analysts Remain Plugged In to Enron
By Susanne Craig and Jonathan Weil
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

10/26/2001
The Wall Street Journal
C1
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Enron: Rarely have so many analysts liked a stock they concede they know so=
 little about.=20
In recent years, Wall Street researchers have been overwhelmingly -- critic=
s would say blindly -- enthusiastic about Enron, even as they acknowledge n=
ot always understanding the complex financial transactions that accounted f=
or its soaring profits. Now, Enron is reporting steep losses from some of i=
ts most complicated transactions, which many on Wall Street still can't fig=
ure out.
In a research note Wednesday, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer concede=
d that scant corporate disclosure at the Houston energy trader makes it dif=
ficult to value the company. The company's "lack of disclosure and transpar=
ency," he says, is "a longstanding Enron hallmark."=20
So is this a stock to avoid, in his view? Hardly. Goldman on Wednesday did =
bump Enron off its "U.S. Select List," which consists of a few dozen top st=
ock picks -- but Mr. Fleischer continued to keep the stock on the firm's la=
rger but prestigious "Recommended List" of 200 or so favored stocks, where =
it has been since he joined Goldman in 1993.=20
"Just because I can't be specific in being able to create a simple model . =
. . doesn't mean that you write off that industry and say `I can't analyze =
it' or `I can't figure it out,' " says Mr. Fleischer, who owns an undisclos=
ed number of Enron shares. "If that were the case, there would be an awful =
lot of industries we couldn't follow."=20
Enron's shares have dropped about 50% since last week.=20
"Every sell-side analyst we spoke to early in 2001 admitted that this was a=
 black box," says Jim Chanos, principal of Kynikos Associates in New York, =
who has been selling Enron stock short -- trading it with an eye to profiti=
ng from its fall -- throughout this year. "It was really a trust-me story, =
when all the evidence was mounting that there was reason to question that l=
evel of trust."=20
True, no stock picker is immune from bad calls. And Wall Street analysts lo=
ng have been criticized for their overwhelmingly bullish bias, particularly=
 on stocks in hot sectors with lots of investment-banking deals to be had.=
=20
But Enron stands apart, precisely because so many of the analysts still rec=
ommending the stock have acknowledged that the company's disclosure practic=
es are lacking. Which raises the question: How can an analyst recommend tha=
t others purchase a stock when key information about the company's operatio=
ns is so often either unavailable or indecipherable?=20
Concerns about the way that Enron runs its business aren't new. Many of the=
 issues now plaguing Enron's stock were first raised more than a year ago b=
y bearish hedge-fund managers and independent accounting experts. Yet time =
and again, Wall Street analysts dismissed as unimportant many of the linger=
ing questions about the company's various partnership transactions.=20
Besides those partnerships, Enron also has been dogged by concerns about th=
e secretive valuation techniques it uses to record its assets and earnings.=
=20
Through it all, most analysts have stuck by this onetime stock-market darli=
ng, publicly dismissing questions about the firm's accounting practices and=
 level of disclosure. As of yesterday, of the 17 analysts who following the=
 stock, 10 had a "strong buy" or equivalent rating on the stock, according =
to Thomson Financial/First Call. Five others rated the stock a "buy," thoug=
h not strongly.=20
Only Prudential Securities, which downgraded the stock this week, has a "se=
ll" rating on Enron.=20
The bullish treatment is the latest and one of the most high-profile exampl=
es of Wall Street taking a glass half-full stance, despite what in retrospe=
ct seems to be ample warning that a less-enthusiastic approach was warrante=
d.=20
Over the past year in the wake of the Nasdaq Composite Index's general coll=
apse, analysts have been widely assailed for a lack of independence -- part=
icularly those who, like Goldman's Mr. Fleischer, own shares in the compani=
es they cover. Regulators have raised concerns that analysts have compromis=
ed themselves to help their firms land lucrative investment-banking fees an=
d other revenue.=20
Enron has spread the wealth across many Wall Street firms. For instance, fo=
r one $865 million equity offering in 1999 led by `Credit Suisse First Bost=
on, Enron retained seven co-managers, including Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette=
, Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.=20
"Enron is a big company, and I don't think you're going to find a firm that=
 hasn't been involved," says Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Curt Launer=
, who still rates the stock a "strong buy" with a $40 price target. "They p=
ay a lot of investment-banking fees to Wall Street."=20
He adds, "We do our analysis every day based on the information we have. Ar=
e we here strictly to defend companies? That's ludicrous. We're here to pro=
vide information to investors. . . . Yes, I have the wrong recommendation o=
n the stock. I don't think my analysis has been as wrong as the stock has p=
erformed."=20
Mr. Fleischer, whose firm also has served as an investment banker to Enron,=
 calls his holding "a meaningful investment" that is "not small." But he di=
sputes any suggestion that his objectivity is compromised. Mr. Fleischer sa=
ys his clients "are happy to know" he has a stake in Enron, because it show=
s he puts his money where his mouth is.=20
In his research note Wednesday, Mr. Fleischer called for complete disclosur=
es of Enron's off-balance sheet partnerships. Despite the resulting difficu=
lty he acknowledged facing in developing financial models for the company, =
he wrote that he and many other investors historically "have given Enron th=
e benefit of doubt because of its strong growth in earnings" and position a=
s an industry leader.=20
"There's not information to really model this and be able to predict accura=
tely where revenues are going to come from and where they're going to make =
their money, but every quarter they do," he says. "It's hard to get inside =
to know all the transactions, but they do deliver."=20
CSFB's Mr. Launer also has been a longtime defender of the company, occasio=
nally issuing research reports to rebut critical stories about Enron in the=
 financial press. On Monday, he wrote that he expects questions about Enron=
's partnerships and accounting disclosures to continue, but that he remains=
 "confident in the businesses and operating growth prospects for [Enron] an=
d an ultimate recovery in the share price."=20
"I know I'm wrong on the stock," Mr. Launer says. But he says that at these=
 prices, he isn't ready to throw in the towel because he figures that even =
in a worst-case scenario -- under which he envisions Enron having to issue =
as much as $2 billion worth of shares, diluting current holders -- the stoc=
k doesn't have much further to fall.=20
Clearly, Messrs. Launer and Flesicher aren't alone. "Even in relative terms=
, analysts remain very bullish on this stock," says Chuck Hill, director of=
 research at Thomson Financial/First Call. The average rating for a stock o=
n Wall Street is 2.2, or slightly shy of a "buy" rating. Enron scores a 1.6=
. "This may turn into a classic case of locking the barn door after the bad=
 news is out," Mr. Hill says.=20
In downgrading the stock this week, Prudential analyst Carol Coale bumped i=
t to "sell" from "buy," with a brief stop at "hold." While she is the only =
analyst to recommend investors sell the stock, she openly concedes her rece=
nt downgrades come "too little, too late."=20
Ms. Coale says Enron has been difficult to cover for years. She says the co=
mpany's disclosure practices fall far short of ideal, and senior executives=
 are often evasive, even when presented with direct questions. For instance=
, she says three weeks ago she asked Enron management if the company was un=
der investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. They said "no,=
" she says.=20
In light of the company's acknowledgment this week of an SEC "inquiry," she=
 asked Enron about the previous denial. "They told me it is an inquiry, not=
 an investigation," she says. An Enron spokeswoman says the company learned=
 of the SEC's inquiry only last Wednesday.

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

Enron Draws Down $3 Bln in Credit to Boost Investor Confidence

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp., whose stock has
fallen on concern about the largest energy trader's transactions
with affiliates, drew down $3 billion in credit to restore
confidence in its financial strength.

     The Houston-based company will use about $2.2 billion to pay
off commercial paper obligations and keep the rest as cash,
spokesman Mark Palmer said.

     ``Nothing instils confidence like cash,'' he said.

     Enron's shares have dropped 52 percent in the past 10 days as
investors worry that the company's credit rating will be cut after
$1.01 billion in third-quarter losses from failed investments.
Enron needs good credit to raise cash daily to keep trading
partners from demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     Investors say they are worried about $3.3 billion in
liabilities from affiliates formed to buy and sell Enron assets.
Enron ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow on Wednesday
amid a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into
partnerships he ran that cost the company $35 million.

     Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets group, was
named CFO in a bid to restore investor confidence, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Lay said in a statement.

     Enron shares fell 6 cents to $16.35 yesterday.

Enron Liked By Analysts Despite Complicated Dealings, WSJ Says
2001-10-26 06:12 (New York)

     Houston, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is liked by many
Wall Street analysts despite lingering questions about the power
trading company's complicated partnership transactions and the
techniques used to record earnings, the Wall Street Journal
reported in its ``Heard on the Street'' column.

     Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst David Fleischer, who owns an
undisclosed number of Enron shares, said that even though
inadequate corporate disclosure makes it difficult to value the
company, that doesn't mean he will write off the industry or not
analyze Enron.

     Of the 17 analysts who follow the stock, 10 had a ``strong
buy'' or equivalent rating, according to Thomson Financial/First
Call, the paper said. Five rated it ``buy'' and one had a ``sell''
on Enron.

     Most analysts have stuck by the company, publicly dismissing
questions about Enron's accounting practices and level of
disclosure, the Journal said.

     The Securities and Exchange Commission is inquiring about
partnerships run by former Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.


Enron Draws Down $3 Billion From Its Credit Lines, WSJ Reports
2001-10-26 00:28 (New York)

     New York, Oct. 26 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. drew down about
$3 billion of its available credit, the bulk of its bank credit
lines, to restore confidence in the financial strength of the
company, the Wall Street Journal reported.

     The energy trading company, whose shares have fallen 52
percent since Oct. 16, will use part of the money to redeem about
$1.85 billion short-term commercial debt, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter.

     Enron is talking to banks about a new, multi-billion line of
credit, the paper reported, citing the unidentified person. The
steps are seen as an effort by the energy trader to ensure that it
has adequate liquidity in case its access to bank credit is
disrupted, the paper said.

     Enron said in a statement distributed by PR Newswire that it
drew on its credit lines to provide more than $1 billion in cash
liquidity. The steps come a day after Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow resigned amid a Securities and Exchange Commission
probe of partnerships he ran.

Action by Enron halts stock's fall=20
But credit ratings are being reviewed=20

The recent freefall of Enron Corp.'s stock price stabilized Thursday, a day=
 after the world's largest energy trader replaced its chief financial offic=
er.=20
Enron, under a cloud for a number of reasons, including an Securities and E=
xchange Commission inquiry, also made two announcements Thursday night aime=
d at reassuring the financial community.=20
In the announcements, Enron said it had drawn more than $1 billion from its=
 lines of credit and said that energy-trading business done through EnronOn=
line on Thursday was above average levels.=20
Houston-based Enron banked the money and has no plans to spend it, a spokes=
woman said.=20
"We are making it clear that Enron has the full support of its banks and mo=
re than adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our =
commitments in the ordinary course of business," Jeff McMahon, who took ove=
r Wednesday as chief financial officer, said in a written statement.=20
Enron said it recorded more than 8,300 transactions through EnronOnline on =
Thursday.=20
Ken Lay, chairman and chief executive officer, said: "Enron continues to be=
 the market-maker of choice in wholesale and gas power markets, our custome=
rs continue to put their confidence in us, and our core businesses are stro=
ng and performing well."=20
Earlier Thursday, two credit rating agencies took actions regarding Enron's=
 ratings, which J.P. Morgan Securities analyst Anatol Feygin described as "=
just more negative sentiment."=20
At one point in Thursday morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, sh=
ares in Enron were up more than $1.50, but they closed down 6 cents at $16.=
35. As recently as Oct. 16, the stock closed at $33.84.=20
Before the market closed, international credit-rating agency Fitch put Enro=
n, which currently holds investment-grade credit ratings, on review for a p=
ossible downgrade. Then after the market closed, Standard & Poor's took two=
 steps: It affirmed Enron's current ratings, but it also revised its long-t=
erm ratings outlook to negative.=20

Corporate US on track for bailout
DAVID GOW IN NEW YORK

Battered corporate America will receive an immediate Dollars 25bn (pounds 1=
8bn) tax rebate under a Dollars 100bn eocnomic stimulation package just app=
roved by the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.=20
The controversial package, worth an estimated Dollars 212bn over three year=
s, includes Dollars 70bn for companies next year alone. It was approved by =
the House late on Wednesday by 216 votes to 214, but faces significant amen=
dment in the Senate, which is now under Democrat control.
It has reopened a wide ideological rift between Republicans, who favour cor=
porate and individual tax cuts to reboot an economy mired in recession, and=
 Democrats - who, in a reprise of the Roosevelt "new deal", prefer to see i=
ncreased public spending on unemployment and infrastructure projects.=20
Liberal lobby groups such as the Citizens for Tax Justice and the Center on=
 Budget and Policy Priorities claim the bill would hand back Dollars 6.3bn =
to the 14 biggest corporations - which, they say, are renowned for paying l=
ittle or no tax.=20
The most hotly contested measure is the repeal of the corporate alternative=
 minimum tax, or AMT, introduced in 1986 to make sure firms could not avoid=
 all tax payments. This, strongly supported by President Bush, would be mad=
e retroactive so that all AMT payments would be refunded.=20
The lobby groups and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service calcul=
ate that this would give a Dollars 1.4bn boost to computer group IBM alone,=
 while General Motors would get back Dollars 833m and General Electric Doll=
ars 671m.=20
Others to benefit include TXU, the Texas-based utility that is the US's thi=
rd largest energy supplier, which would would be given Dollars 608m. United=
 Airlines, the US's second largest carrier - which is warning of bankruptcy=
 - would receive Dollars 371m, and Enron, the energy trading group forced t=
o sack its finance director this week, would be given Dollars 254m.=20
Democrat leaders in the Senate are determined to erase this measure and dis=
like other proposals to boost firms, which include a 30% tax break for capi=
tal investment over three years worth Dollars 39.3bn this year alone. They =
say these amount to a "giant corporate giveaway".=20
Mr Bush and other Republican leaders argue these fiscal concessions would h=
elp companies making hundreds of thousands redundant avoid further lay-offs=
 and invest more, prompting an economic recovery that, at best, is likely t=
o start in the new year.=20
"Businesses are America's employers. They're the hardware store, the diner =
down the street, the gas station on the corner. They're not the enemy of wo=
rking families," the author of the plan, Representative Bill Thomas of Cali=
fornia, said.=20
Democrats are especially incensed with the alleged paucity of the package's=
 provisions for the growing numbers of jobless, arguing that much of the Do=
llars 12bn foreseen would not go to individuals but into the reserves of st=
ates.=20

Harvey Pitt's S.E.C.: From Guard Dog to Friendly Puppy?
By FLOYD NORRIS

10/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

CAN the new, friendlier Securities and Exchange Commission enforce the laws=
 and assure investors that corporate financial reports are trustworthy?=20
Harvey L. Pitt, the new S.E.C. chairman, set out this week to show that he =
is not like his predecessor, Arthur Levitt. In a speech to the American Ins=
titute of Certified Public Accountants -- an organization whose senior lead=
ership led a bitter and ultimately unsuccessful fight against Mr. Levitt's =
reform efforts -- Mr. Pitt praised his listeners and took a few swipes at h=
is predecessor.=20
>From now on, he promised, ''the commission will make sound decisions, in a =
respectful, affirmative way, not in a demeaning, demanding or demonizing wa=
y.'' He spoke favorably of ''pro forma'' earnings reports, in ways that no =
doubt heartened accountants who have worked so hard to find ways to make ev=
en the worst profit figures look pretty. There was no mention of Mr. Levitt=
's concerns about improper management of earnings.
On the heels of Mr. Pitt's speech, the S.E.C. used a minor enforcement acti=
on to herald a policy of not cracking down on companies that come forward t=
o report their own errors. The decision itself was reasonable, although one=
 could wonder if top management did something wrong in failing to detect a =
fraud that went on for years. But the way the S.E.C. trumpeted it raised qu=
estions about whether the agency is turning into a friendly puppy rather th=
an a guard dog. ''Is this amnesty for financial fraud?'' Jane Adams, the ac=
counting analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston and a former S.E.C. staff me=
mber, asked in a report to clients. She was not sure of the answer.=20
In an interview yesterday, Mr. Pitt dismissed such worries. ''No one is goi=
ng to get away with anything,'' he said. ''What we are trying to do is crea=
te an environment where people feel comfortable'' and can talk to the S.E.C=
. ''without feeling we are looking for a big splash.''=20
A major embarrassment for accountants is having the S.E.C. force a client t=
o restate its numbers. Mr. Pitt and his chief accountant, Robert Herdman, a=
re sending signals that fewer such demands will be made. ''I am very much i=
n favor of a vigorous enforcement program,'' Mr. Pitt said in the interview=
, ''but I am not in favor of having investors barraged by conflicting state=
ments and restatements.''=20
Mr. Pitt talks of companies ''getting it right the first time,'' which woul=
d certainly be nice. But there is a risk that companies will become more ag=
gressive in their accounting, figuring there will be no real penalty, like =
a restatement, if they are caught. That would make life harder for auditors=
 who try to resist misleading accounting.=20
In trying to sound comforting to the accountants' group -- an organization =
that, as he noted, he had represented as a lawyer for two decades -- Mr. Pi=
tt has done little to reassure investors of his independence.=20
The proof, of course, will come in the performance. Fortunately, the mess a=
t Enron gives the S.E.C. a golden opportunity to counter the puppy image. I=
t will take time for the commission to determine if the company's accountin=
g was proper. But there need be no delay in forcing Enron to clearly explai=
n -- rather than obfuscate as it has so far -- the strange deals it made wi=
th partnerships run by the executive just ousted as chief financial officer=
.=20
''This could,'' a former S.E.C. staff member said, ''focus the issue on whe=
ther companies can make completely correct but totally misleading disclosur=
es.'' And it would indicate that this watchdog still has a bite.

The Five Dumbest Things on Wall Street This Week
By K.C. Swanson <mailto:kcswanson@thestreet.com>
Staff Reporter
10/26/2001 07:08 AM EDT
URL: <http://www.thestreet.com/markets/dumbest/10003035.html>
TheStreet.com
1. United Airlines Just a Little Too Honest
Rule No. 1 in CEO school: Never say that your company may soon collapse.=20
Seems kind of obvious, but that rule was flouted by United Airlines chief J=
ames Goodwin, who warned in a letter to employees that the company "will pe=
rish" next year unless it can stanch its tremendous losses, which have wors=
ened since the terrorist attacks. "Today, we are literally hemorrhaging mon=
ey," he wrote.=20
In raising concerns about the financial viability of United, a unit of UAL =
(UAL:NYSE - news - commentary) , Goodwin only put into words what outsiders=
 have speculated about. Since Sept. 11, the airline has laid off about 20,0=
00 of its 100,000 employees and cut flights by as much as 25%. It's expecte=
d to announce massive losses when it reports third-quarter earnings.=20
But in response to the disclosure, Goodwin has been roundly attacked. Feeli=
ng that he had been all too honest, investors have knocked an additional 24=
% off the stock's value. The shares are down 54% since Sept 11. Meanwhile, =
UAL union leaders reportedly say Goodwin has exaggerated company difficulti=
es to gain bargaining leverage in union negotiations. The leaders of one un=
ion have petitioned the company's board of directors to have him sacked.=20
Bottom line: CEOs may get pilloried when they try to dodge the truth, but s=
ometimes it doesn't pay to be too candid about worst-case scenarios, either=
. Especially when that scenario is the company's own demise.=20
2. Forget the Victory Gardens; Let's Have a Comfortable War=20
Sure, we're at war with a band of cave-dwelling outlaws hell bent on our an=
nihilation. But would all freedom-loving Americans please go out and buy so=
me DVD players? Maybe even a nice new car?=20
That was basically the message from the Treasury Department, on news that C=
ongress had voted for the creation of war bonds to finance antiterrorism ef=
forts and rebuilding following the attacks. Officials at Treasury applauded=
 the sentiment, then politely suggested it would be even better for the eco=
nomy if Americans just went to stores and bought stuff. "The economy is per=
haps our greatest asset as we move forward in these efforts to fight the wa=
r on global terrorists," says Betsy Holahan, a department spokesperson. "Wa=
r bonds are an additional way for Americans to show their patriotism."=20
For the record, we don't think an issue of war bonds would be dumb, just su=
perfluous. After all, nothing's stopped Americans from buying generic savin=
gs bonds -- or better yet, Treasuries -- all of which finance spending by t=
he federal government.=20
In the meantime, it's a little dislocating to hear politicians talk up war =
bonds -- which most people associate with hardship and sacrifice -- at the =
same time top economic gurus are practically begging people to shop. War bo=
nds notwithstanding, we're a long way off from the era of ration books.=20
3. Enron Again
Last week, we noted the extent of alarm about Enron's (ENE:NYSE - news - co=
mmentary) revelation that its shareholder equity had dropped $1.2 billion, =
following some unusual and possibly inappropriate high-level transactions. =
Following that disclosure, besieged CFO Andrew Fastow has finally left the =
company on what's delicately termed a "leave of absence."=20
In July, Fastow exited a limited partnership, from which he had reportedly =
reaped large profits, after shareholders and analysts objected to his invol=
vement. Concerns about those dealings and others had increased in the wake =
of the disclosure about the charge to equity until even management acknowle=
dged Fastow would have to go as a prerequisite to restoring investor confid=
ence.=20
But that won't be an easy task, given the resentment about Enron's disincli=
nation to explain its problems. One analyst called Fastow's departure "unse=
ttling," noting that management had given the CFO its endorsement only the =
day before. Sounding a note of exasperation, analysts at J.P. Morgan Chase,=
 Banc of America Securities and Prudential all downgraded the stock. And th=
ere could be more trouble to come: The Securities and Exchange Commission h=
as issued Enron a letter of inquiry related to some of its transactions.=20
4. Gold Diggers=20
It's understandable that investors felt panicky in September. Unfortunately=
, some reacted by shoving their hard-earned money into gold funds. Accordin=
g to Financial Research Corp., which tracks fund flows, the specialty preci=
ous-metals category was the best-selling equity category during September, =
with net inflows of $101 million.=20
Granted, that's not a huge sum in the mutual fund world. By comparison, dur=
ing the same month, large growth funds saw net redemptions of $7.4 billion.=
 But the fact that so many people are jumping into precious metals is notew=
orthy, given that gold funds have performed so badly for so long.=20
Sure, under the bizarre circumstances of late, they've enjoyed somewhat of =
a pop. According to Morningstar, the average precious-metals fund is up 10.=
08% year to date. But over the past five years, the same category lost an e=
mbarrassing 14.68%. By comparison, even large-cap growth funds -- everybody=
's favorite whipping boy -- managed to post a positive return. In the same =
period, they were up 7.13%.=20
Moreover, circumstances that would seem to be the most favorable in decades=
 -- a combination of attacks on the U.S. government and war -- still don't =
seem to have boosted gold prices significantly. Despite an initial surge in=
 prices after the terrorist attacks, they're again approaching their pre-Se=
pt. 11 levels. It's too early to say, but it's likely the gold bugs will co=
nfront disappointment once again.=20
5. Amazon Amazes Once Again
Amazon (AMZN:Nasdaq - news - commentary) still maintains it will become pro=
fitable by the fourth quarter. Well, at least it will post a pro forma oper=
ating profit.=20
OK, so maybe that wouldn't include Amazon's service on $2.17 billion in lon=
g-term debt or extraordinary charges. In fact, a pro forma operating profit=
 is basically just an accounting concept that would lend a fuzzy, meaningle=
ss aura of minor triumph. The company still hasn't said when it will turn a=
n economic profit.=20
For that matter, even the fourth-quarter prediction is iffy. After announci=
ng the company expected to turn the pro forma operating profit, CFO Warren =
Jenson added the humble qualifier, "There are no guarantees." Amazon simult=
aneously lowered its forecast for fourth-quarter revenue, predicting that s=
ales would be somewhere between flat and up by 10% compared with a year ago=
.=20
Third-quarter trends weren't encouraging. Though sales overall were up slig=
htly in the third quarter from a year ago, revenue from the company's core =
books and music business actually fell 12%. At least the company has made p=
rogress in cutting costs: A spokesperson says pro forma operating expenses =
have decreased by 20% over the past year.=20
Incidentally, in the wake of Amazon's earnings report, two analysts made th=
e belated decision to cut their ratings on the stock, which has fallen 93% =
from its high back in December 1999. Merrill Lynch analyst Henry Blodget an=
d SG Cowen analyst Scott Reamer downgraded the stock to "neutral" from prev=
ious buy ratings. "We thought there might be upside to our estimates," note=
d Blodget. "There wasn't."=20

NEW YORK, Oct. 25 -- Selected buying of technology and energy shares pulled=
 the stock market higher today, reversing a morning slide triggered by a pa=
ir of grim economic reports.=20
Shares of semiconductor makers and equipment manufacturers did particularly=
 well, as did energy traders, led by a surprisingly strong performance from=
 Williams Cos., a Tulsa-based energy firm that had an 83 percent jump in th=
ird-quarter net earnings.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed rose at 9448.78, up 103.16, reversi=
ng an earlier deficit of 167 points. The Nasdaq composite index rose 36.29,=
 to 1767.83, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index was rose 12.79, to 1097.99=
.=20
Earlier, a pair of dismal economic reports had compounded worries about the=
 fallout from last month's terrorist attacks to send stocks lower. As in re=
cent sessions, however, investors absorbed the bad news and focused on good=
 news regarding individual companies.=20
Williams Cos. surpassed analysts' estimates for the third quarter and raise=
d its forecasts for full-year earnings for 2001 and 2002. Investors rewarde=
d the company by driving its shares up $1.42, to $27.32, bringing several o=
ther parts of the energy sector along with it.=20
Even the shares of Enron rose, a day after the embattled company dismissed =
its chief financial officer and replaced him with an another executive from=
 within the company. Enron rose 28 cents, to $16.69.=20
Semiconductor shares also rebounded, led by industry bellwether Intel, up 4=
4 cents at $25.92, and Applied Materials, up $1.35 at 36.69. Leading data-s=
torage maker EMC rose $1.06, to $13.54.=20
Traders said the Senate's passage this afternoon of an anti-terrorism measu=
re also helped lift investor sentiment. Late Wednesday, the House passed a =
$100 billion economic stimulus package to combat the effects of the terrori=
st attacks on the economy.=20
A surprisingly large drop in orders for durable goods had weighed heavily o=
n the market in the morning, as did poor earnings results from American Int=
ernational Group and WorldCom.=20
The Commerce Department reported orders plunged in September for the fourth=
 consecutive month. The 8.5 percent decline was far worse than the 1.3 perc=
ent dip many analysts had forecast.=20
The Labor Department also reported that the number of newly laid-off Americ=
ans filing for unemployment benefits rose by 8,000 last week, to 504,000, t=
he second-highest figure in nearly a decade and a level that is generally a=
ssociated with recessions.=20
Other Indicators=20
* The New York Stock Exchange composite index rose 5.88, to 562.96; the Ame=

ume totaled 2.2 billion, up from 1.84 billion.=20
* The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose $4.38 per $1,000 invested, =
and its yield fell to 4.54 percent, from 4.59 percent late Wednesday.=20
* The dollar rose against the Japanese yen and the euro. In late New York t=
rading, a dollar bought 122.87 yen, up from 122.76 yen late Wednesday, and =

Enron Taps $3 Billion From Bank Lines in Pre-Emptive Move to Ensure Liquidi=
ty

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Embattled Enron Corp. drew down about $3 billion, the bulk of its available=
 bank credit lines, in a bid to restore confidence in its financial strengt=
h and liquidity, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.=20
Enron (ENE) will use part of the money to offer to redeem around $1.85 bill=
ion in outstanding commercial paper -- short-term corporate IOUs -- accordi=
ng to a person familiar with the matter, with the remainder used to provide=
 a cash cushion. This person also said that Enron was talking to its banks =
about a new multibillion-dollar credit line. Some observers thought the mov=
es were a pre-emptive step by Enron to ensure that it had adequate liquidit=
y should its access to bank lines be interrupted.
Enron insists its business operation and financial condition remain strong.=
 But "when the market is reacting as irrationally as it has been the last f=
ew days, we thought that cash was better than a commitment from a bank," sa=
id an Enron spokesman. In a prepared statement, the company's new chief fin=
ancial officer, Jeff McMahon, said that by drawing down the bank lines, "we=
 are making it clear that Enron has the support of its banks and more than =
adequate liquidity to assure our customers that we can fulfill our commitme=
nts."=20
The move underscored the tumultuous conditions that have been sweeping over=
 the Houston energy-trading firm in the past 10 days. Enron is the nation's=
 largest energy trader and is a principal in nearly one-quarter of all elec=
tricity and natural-gas trades. Thursday, for example, Enron was involved i=
n about $4 billion worth of deals through its EnronOnline unit.=20
Since early last week, Enron's share price has plummeted 50%. It has report=
ed a $618 million third-quarter loss and a reduction in shareholder equity =
of $1.2 billion. It also disclosed that the Securities and Exchange Commiss=
ion is conducting an inquiry into billions of dollars of transactions it di=
d with entities run by its former chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow=
, who was replaced Wednesday.=20
The draw-down of the credit facilities came as a major rating agency, Fitch=
, put Enron on review for a possible downgrade while Standard & Poors chang=
ed Enron's credit outlook to negative from stable. Moody's Investors Servic=
e has already said it is looking at a possible downgrade. In order to fall =
below investment grade, Enron's credit rating would have to fall several no=
tches.=20
If that were to happen, however, a host of bad consequences could follow. T=
ogether with the sharp decline in its stock price, a noninvestment grade ra=
ting would throw the company into default on obligations involving billions=
 of dollars of borrowings. In that event, Enron could be forced to issue mi=
llions of shares of stock to holders of that debt, diluting the value of ex=
isting shares. As of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, E=
nron shares were down six cents at $16.35.=20

NEW YORK (AP) - As it grew over the past decade into the country's largest =
natural gas and power marketing company, Enron Corp. became the de facto ba=
rometer of health within the energy trading sector.=20
Wall Street buoyed the stock prices of Enron's competitors based in part on=
 the huge success of the Houston-based company's business model. Now, execu=

 They say the Houston-based company's problems should be viewed in isolatio=

 when Enron's latest woes appeared to spill over into the stock prices of i=
ts rivals.=20
Enron's stock has fallen about 50 percent in the past week (and nearly 80 p=
ercent since January) and analysts said its recovery is not expected anytim=
e soon.=20
The latest troubles began Oct. 16 when Enron reported third quarter earning=

First came reports that some of the company's losses stemmed from partnersh=

"They created an environment in which their credibility was put to the test=

"It's business as usual," said Dynegy spokesman Steve Stengel.=20
Not for Enron, whose stock price began a steady descent 10 months ago when =
its nascent high-speed Internet unit failed to live up to the hype. The dow=
nward momentum was further propelled by difficulties collecting money from =
power customers in India and the surprise departure in August of then-chief=
 executive Jeff Skilling was considered another bad sign.=20
On Oct. 16, Enron reported a net loss of $638 million in the third quarter,=
 taking a one-time charge of $1.01 billion attributed to investment losses,=
 troubled assets and unit restructurings. Excluding the charge, Enron earne=
d $393 million on $47.6 billion in revenues for the three months ending Sep=
t. 30.=20
Ellinghaus said the stocks of Enron's competitors were brought down Wednesd=

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)
2001-10-25 18:59 (New York)

Enron's Credit Outlook Downgraded to Negative by S&P (Update1)

     (Adds analyst comment in fourth paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s long-term
credit ratings outlook was changed to negative from stable by
Standard & Poor's after the largest energy trader's shares fell
49 percent in the past week.

     S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's ratings of
``BBB+/A2,'' which are investment grade.

     The ratings company cited lost market capitalization and the
possibility that Enron won't generate enough money from selling
assets outside the main trading business to repay debt. S&P did
say that ``the strategic direction of the company is likely to
become more credit-positive in the wake of recent management
changes.''

     Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses from investments
outside the principal business of trading commodities such as
electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew
Fastow resigned yesterday as the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission asks for information about related-party transactions
he conducted.

     ``The S&P write up was very positive,'' said Dorothea
Matthews, an analyst at CreditSights Inc., a research firm. ``It
seems that the ratings company went out of its way to tray and
calm things down.''

     Shares of Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35.

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)
2001-10-25 19:38 (New York)

Enron's Trading Partners Say It's Business as Usual (Update2)

     (Adds new Enron CFO in 14th paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Concerns Enron Corp. will run
short on cash haven't prevented commodities traders from doing
business with the largest energy broker, customers say.

     The company handles about 25 percent of U.S. power and
natural-gas trading, said John Kilduff, vice president of energy
risk management for Fimat USA. It's also a leader in complex
derivatives that allow others to hedge against the risk of
fluctuating commodities prices.

     Enron's credit rating is on watch for possible downgrade at
Moody's Investors Service, and Standard & Poor's lowered Enron's
long-term credit outlook to negative after $1.01 billion in third-
quarter losses from some soured investments. The company needs
good credit to raise cash every day to keep trading partners from
demanding collateral and to settle transactions.

     So far, there are no signs that Houston-based Enron is
handling less business, Kilduff said.

     ``If they were unable to perform, it would be a major
problem,'' he said. ``It could get like Long-Term Capital if
things really broke down because the numbers are that big.''

     Long-Term Capital Management, a private investment fund for
the wealthy, incurred massive losses making bond trades during the
1998 Russian currency crisis. The fund's portfolio plunged. More
than a dozen banks bailed out the fund at a cost of $3.6 billion
to avoid a collapse.

                         Needs Cash Daily

     Enron trades electricity, natural gas, coal and other
commodities worldwide, as well as complex financial instruments to
hedge against price swings in the goods.

     ``As of now, Enron is active in the markets,'' Kilduff said.
``No one is cutting trading lines that I can see, or demanding
different terms than before.''

     Companies that trade as heavily as Enron require cash every
day to settle positions, said Kilduff, whose company swaps natural
gas and other energy investments with Enron.

     Some days, Fimat will bet that natural-gas prices will fall,
while Enron bets that they will rise. Natural gas usually does one
or the other every day, and someone pays the difference.

     ``The liquidity of your trading partners is a risk factor,''
Kilduff said. ``Someone is paying someone else every day.''

     Enron said on a conference call Tuesday that it has enough
money to operate normally, and can fall back on $3.4 billion in
bank credit lines if necessary. The company is determined to
protect the credit rating, Enron has said.

     ``We aren't even going to entertain worst-case scenarios at
this point,'' said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.

                        Investor Questions

     Enron, based in Houston, ousted Chief Financial Officer
Andrew Fastow yesterday, two days after the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission began asking questions about partnerships he
ran that invested in company shares. Those trades cost Enron $35
million. Jeff McMahon, head of Enron's industrial markets unit,
replaced Fastow, who went on leave of absence.

     Enron shares have fallen 49 percent in the past week. They
fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.

     Based on Bloomberg composite ratings, most of Enron's long-
term debt is rated at BBB2 and BBB1, two or three levels above
investment grade. Fitch, Standard & Poor's and Moody's all rate
the company's debt at investment grade.

     The company also faces questions from investors about $3.3
billion in potential liabilities from affiliated companies formed
to buy and sell Enron assets such as power plants.

     The affiliates owe payments to bond investors and plan to
meet them by selling assets. Enron doesn't know if the sale
proceeds will cover the debt. The company would have to make good
on any shortfall.

                            Little Time

     Enron asked Citicorp Inc. on Tuesday to arrange a $750
million loan to ensure access to credit if the company gets shut
out of the money markets.

     Enron had about $1.85 billion of commercial paper, or short-
term unsecured debt, outstanding as of Tuesday, traders said. The
company, which has a $3 billion program, has had difficulty
finding buyers for new commercial paper sales since the SEC
investigation was announced, the traders said.

     Today, Enron offered two-week commercial paper at a 3 percent
yield, 10 to 15 basis points above comparably rated companies.

     ``There appears to be enough liquidity to give them enough
time to get their house in order,'' said Jon Kyle Cartwright,
senior energy credit analyst at Raymond James & Associates.
``There's a point where a credibility crisis becomes a self-
fulfilling prophecy, so they have less time than they think to
pacify the market.''

                           Ripple Effect

     Some investors are concerned that Enron's complex book of
hedges, swaps, options and other derivative contracts involves so
many partners, participants and companies that a failure would
pose a risk to the economy, and force a bailout like Long-Term
Capital Management's.

     ``The talk in the financial markets is that some counter
party to Enron could fail if Enron can't perform,'' said Jeff
Caughron, manager of $400 million in investments for Tinker
Federal Credit Union in Oklahoma City. ``If it goes down, there
could be a big ripple effect.''

     The effect has already spread as investors worry Enron won't
be able to pay bills owed to power producers such as Calpine
Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and NRG Inc., said Chris
Ellinghaus, an analyst at Williams Capital Group. As a group,
shares of the four have fallen 11 percent in the past week.

     ``Rumors that these companies have receivables with Enron are
fueling a sell-off,'' he said. ``Both traders and companies
selling power to Enron are suffering.''

     All four companies said they're trading with Enron as they
have in the past.

                         Market Maker

     Enron supplies services some customers consider
irreplaceable. The Sacramento Municipal Utilities District hedges
weather risk through Enron, said risk manager Jim Tracy.

     The district entered into an agreement that forces it to pay
Enron if rainfall is abundant and hydroelectric dams can operate
at peak efficiency and capacity; in dry seasons, when the dams
can't operate as well, Enron pays the district.

     ``If Enron's credit went bad, or they folded up, that
agreement wouldn't get picked up by someone else,'' Tracy said.

     Enron also helps many U.S. utilities protect themselves from
electricity and natural gas price fluctuations in the same way it
helps the Sacramento utility district hedge against too little
rainfall. Any impairment on Enron's part to continue doing so
would trickle down to Main Street utilities, Tracy said.

     ``Utilities would start reserving more on their balance
sheets for price swings,'' Tracy said.

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) telecommunications unit will clos=

.=20
Enron Broadband Services executives have quietly begun to inform employees =
overseas and haven't made a public announcement of plans to consolidate Asi=
an and European bandwidth trading operations at the company's Houston headq=
uarters.
"It's a way to structure the business to fit the opportunities that are out=
 there in the market now," Enron Broadband Services spokeswoman Terrie Jame=
s said in response to questions from Dow Jones Newswires.=20
The London office has 20 or fewer employees, James told Dow Jones. The Sing=
apore office has 15 or fewer employees.=20
Americans working in the offices would probably choose to relocate in the U=
.S., James said. She didn't know how many of the employees are U.S. citizen=
s. She didn't know what options might be offered to the non-American employ=
ees.=20
James didn't know how much money Enron might save by closing the offices.=
=20
The decision by Enron, the leading bandwidth market-maker, shows that inter=
national bandwidth markets are having tough times like the U.S. market.=20
Earlier this year, as the U.S. market went sour, Enron executives had said =
that European and Asian telecommunications carriers might be more open to b=

Calpine:No Exposure To Enron; No Calif Pwr Contract Talks

10/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Calpine Corp. (CPN) has no credit exposure to tradin=
g partner Enron Corp. (ENE), Calpine said Thursday in an earnings conferenc=
e call. And the company hasn't been contacted by the state of California ab=
out renegotiating the billions of dollars in long-term supply contracts the=
 company signed with the state earlier this year.=20
Calpine's diluted net earnings for the third quarter were 88 cents a share =
compared with 48 cents for the same quarter last year. Setting Calpine's co=
nsistent earnings growth aside, Wall Street analysts in Thursday's conferen=
ce call focused their questions on trouble spots in the energy industry, li=
ke Enron, California, and whether the U.S. will have a surplus of electric =
power stations in a few years.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of=
 the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this=
 week. Trading partners like Calpine have been asked about their exposure t=
o Enron.=20
"We continue to assess the situation, but right now don't have any net expo=
sure to Enron," said Calpine's vice president of corporate risk management,=
 Paul Pasoli. "We continue to trade with them. We will adjust our credit th=
reshold based on how their bonds are trading and their credit rating."=20
When asked if there would be any exposure to Enron if trading were to be ha=
lted immediately, Pasoli said that, in fact, Calpine would owe Enron a litt=
le money.=20
In another energy industry area of concern, Calpine was asked about the sta=
te of California's stated desire to renegotiate tens of billions of dollars=
 of long-term power contracts. Calpine is by far the biggest supplier under=
 those contracts, which on a mark-to-market basis are worth far less now th=
an when California bought this past winter and spring.=20
"Nobody has come to us directly or indirectly with regard to the Calif cont=
racts. In general, we respect our contracts and expect our counterparties t=
o do so as well," said Calpine cheif executive, Peter Cartwright. "If there=
 are any contract renegotiations that can result in a win-win, we would be =
happy to look at that, if California asks. We've done that many times."=20
As for future power prices, Calpine said that it's going forward with its p=
rogram to build a portfolio of 70,000 megawatts of generation, which is abo=
ut three times its current capacity and would be about 7% of all U.S. capac=
ity. The critical determinant of profitability in power generation is the d=
ifference between natural gas prices and power prices, and Calpine said tha=
t difference, or "spark spread," has grown the past few months. Furthermore=
, the company executives said they are holding to a requirement that all pr=
ojects generate an after-tax return of 18% on the investment.=20
As a result, the company expects earnings to grow at least 40% annually thr=
ough 2005. Calpine will fund near-term cash needs in the debt markets and w=
on't issue new stock until its stock price rises substantially.=20

PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2001, PR Newswire)

PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 25 /PRNewswire/ -- The law firm of Spector, Roseman & Ko=
droff, P.C. announces that a class action lawsuit has been commenced in the=
 United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas, Houston D=
ivision, against defendants Enron Corporation ("Enron" or the "Company") (N=
YSE: ENE), Kenneth L. Lay, Jeffrey K. Skilling, and Andrew Fastow, on behal=
f of purchasers of the common stock of Enron during the period between Janu=
ary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, inclusive (the "Class Period").=20
The Complaint alleges that defendants violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of =
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder,=
 by issuing a series of material misrepresentations to the market between J=
anuary 18, 2000 and October 17, 2001, thereby artificially inflating the pr=
ice of Enron common stock. Specifically, the complaint alleges that Enron i=
ssued a series of statements concerning its business, financial results and=
 operations which failed to disclose (i) that the Company's Broadband Servi=
ces Division was experiencing declining demand for bandwidth and the Compan=
y's efforts to create a trading market for bandwidth were not meeting with =
success as many of the market participants were not creditworthy; (ii) that=
 the Company's operating results were materially overstated as result of th=
e Company failing to timely write-down the value of its investments with ce=
rtain limited partnerships which were managed by the Company's chief financ=
ial officer; and (iii) that Enron was failing to write-down impaired assets=
 on a timely basis in accordance with GAAP. On October 16, 2001, Enron surp=
rised the market by announcing that the Company was taking non-recurring ch=
arges of $1.01 billion after-tax, or ($1.11) loss per diluted share, in the=
 third quarter of 2001, the period ending September 30, 2001. Subsequently,=
 Enron revealed that a material portion of the charge related to the unwind=
ing of investments with certain limited partnerships which were controlled =
by Enron's chief financial officer and that the Company would be eliminatin=
g more than $1 billion in shareholder equity as a result of its unwinding o=
f the investments. As this news began to be assimilated by the market, the =
price of Enron common stock dropped significantly. During the Class Period,=
 Enron insiders disposed of over $73 million of their personally held Enron=
 common stock to unsuspecting investors.
If you purchased Enron securities during the Class Period, you may, no late=
r than December 21, 2001, move to be appointed as a Lead Plaintiff in this =
class action. A Lead Plaintiff is a representative, chosen by the Court, th=
at acts on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation. The P=
rivate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 directs Courts to assume th=
at the class member(s) with the "largest financial interest" in the outcome=
 of the case will best serve the class in this capacity. Courts have discre=
tion in determining which class member(s) have the "largest financial inter=
est," and have appointed Lead Plaintiffs with substantial losses in both ab=
solute terms and as a percentage of their net worth. If you have sustained =
substantial losses in Enron securities during the Class Period, please cont=

Enron Draws Down Credit Facility

10/25/2001
Dow Jones News Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) drew on committed lines of credit t=
o provide cash liquidity of more than $1 billion.=20
In a press release Thursday, the energy company said it has "more than adeq=
uate" liquidity to fulfill business commitments.
Enron said the credit action is a step to restore investor confidence, and =
it plans to update investors in several days regarding plans to maintain it=
s long-term credit rating.=20
Earlier Thursday, Standard & Poor's revised its long-term ratings outlook f=
or Enron to negative due to concerns that the company's significant drop in=
 market capitalization has hurt the company's flexibility and could impair =
plans to rebuild the balance sheet.=20
Over the past week, Enron's shares have fallen more than 40% amid negative =
news from the company.=20
The company's New York Stock Exchange-listed shares closed Thursday at $16.=
35, down 6 cents, or 0.4%, on composite volume of 39,212,300 shares. Averag=
e daily volume is 7,832,606 shares.=20
Early last week, the company reported a $618 million third quarter loss, re=
sulting from $1.01 billion in write-offs. Enron also disclosed a $1.2 billi=
on reduction in shareholder equity for the quarter as a result of terminati=
ng certain transactions related to a partnership that for a time was headed=
 by Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow.=20
On Wednesday, Enron replaced Fastow with Jeff McMahon, effective immediatel=
y.=20

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that some bond traders believe En=
ron's bonds won't continue to hold up better the company's stock.=20
The company's five-year bond has decreased about 16% in the past two weeks,=
 much less than the 50% decline in Enron's stock price since the Oct. 16 di=
sclosure of the $1.01 billion charges.=20
But the fall in the bond's price translates to a yield of 7.7 percentage po=
ints above bellwether U.S. government bonds, which is widening from about 3=
 percentage points two weeks ago. Although Enron is still an investment-gra=
de credit, that kind of "spread" is more characteristic of a junk bond with=
 a credit rating of single B or lower, the Journal said.=20
On Wednesday, Fitch put Enron's credit rating on watch for a possible downg=
rade, following a similar move by Moody's Investor Service earlier this wee=
k.=20
Several energy trading companies said Thursday that although they have conc=
erns about Enron's credit quality, they have made almost no changes in poli=
cy concerning the company.=20
Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) and Aquila Inc. (ILA) said they have=
n't changed their credit policy concerning Enron, which accounts for about =
a quarter of the trade in U.S. power and gas markets.=20

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)
2001-10-25 18:41 (New York)

Enron Employees Watch Options Devalue as Shares Fall (Correct)

     (Company corrects structure of standard compensation package
in second paragraph.)

     Houston, Oct. 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. prided itself on
sharing the wealth with employees when the company was posting
record profits last year. Now, from the boardroom to the mailroom,
employees are sharing the pain.

     Enron, the largest energy trader, grants stock options to the
bulk of its 20,000 employees. Under Enron's standard compensation
package, most employees get stock options equal to
5 percent of their annual base salary, spokeswoman Meredith
Philipp said.

     Employees held 46.8 million exercisable options as of the end
of 2000, all at average prices above the company's current share
price. The stock has dropped 80 percent this year.

     ``Virtually every option is under water right now,'' Enron
spokeswoman Karen Denne said.

     Enron's board sets the strike price for the options in
December or January. Employees can't cash the options in and make
a profit unless the stock is trading above the strike price. At
the end of 2000, Enron shares were trading at $83.13. In December,
the board set a strike price of about $80.

     Shares of Houston-based Enron fell 6 cents to $16.35 today.
They have lost 37 percent of their value so far this week.

     Enron said Monday that the Securities and Exchange Commission
was asking questions about partnerships run by Andrew Fastow, who
was ousted as Enron's chief financial officer yesterday. One
partnership cost the company $35 million, and Enron bought back 62
million shares from a partnership at a cost of $1.2 billion.

     Enron named Jeff McMahon, head of its industrial markets
group, as CFO late yesterday.

                         Unvested Options

     Another 96.1 million options granted to Enron employees
hadn't vested as of the end of last year. About 15.4 million of
them, or 16 percent, were at prices ranging from $6.88 to $20 a
share. The rest vest at levels well above the current share price.

     Experts who have watched the devaluation of stock options in
other industries, such as technology and telecommunications, say
it becomes demoralizing for workers to watch share prices fall
below their options.

     ``It looks bad,'' said Mark Edwards, chairman of IQuantic
Buck, a Mellon Financial Corp. unit that provides compensation
consulting. ``Employees look at (the stock price) every day, and
it's a continued disincentive to them.''

     While Denne said Enron doesn't have any plans to reprice its
employees' options, the company did issue a one-time stock option
grant at $36.88 in August, when Ken Lay resumed his former role as
the company's chief executive. Lay, who had held the job for 15
years, turned the position over to Jeffrey Skilling in February.
Skilling quit in August, citing family reasons.

     The August grant, which was equivalent to 5 percent of
employees' base salary, didn't require a vesting period, but was
exercisable immediately. Enron's shares haven't closed above
$36.88 since Aug. 29.

Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an
address or phone number?

I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.

I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
need to leave earlier?

Oh my God! How worried should I be? There are 11 letters in the name

Wait a sec ... just realized "YOU CAN'T HIDE" also has 11 letters! What

believe it! Oh crap, there must be someplace on the planet Earth I could
hide! But no ... PLANET EARTH" has 11 letters, too!  Maybe Nostradamus can
help me. But dare I trust him? There are 11 letters in "NOSTRADAMUS." I
know, the Red Cross can help. No they can't... 11 letters in "THE RED
CROSS," can't trust them. I would rely on self defense, but "SELF DEFENSE"
has 11 letters in it, too! Can someone help?  Anyone? If so, send me email.
No, don't... "SEND ME EMAIL" has 11 letters....

Will this never end? I'm going insane! "GOING INSANE???" Eleven letters!!
Nooooooooooo!!!!!! I guess I'll die alone, even though "I'LL DIE ALONE" has

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

guarantee and cancellation policy applies. Guest will not receive

I want to remind you about our All-Employee Meeting this Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency.  We obviously have a lot to talk about.  Last week we reported third quarter earnings.  We have also been the subject of media reports discussing transactions with LJM, a related party previously managed by our chief financial officer.  Today, we announced that we received a request for information from the Securities and Exchange Commission regarding related party transactions.

I know you will have a number of questions about these issues and events, which I will address.   As usual, I will be as candid as I can.  I will do my best to provide answers and talk about where we go from here.  I encourage each of you to attend or tune in tomorrow.

ANYONE REMEMBER THIS??
IT WAS 1987!
At a UNC lecture the other day they played an old video
of Lt. Col. Oliver North testifying at the Iran-Contra hearings during
the Reagan Administration. There was Ollie in front of God and country
getting the third degree. But what he said was stunning!! He was being
drilled by some senator;

"Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home
security system?"
Ollie replied, "Yes I did sir."
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the
audience, "Isn't this just a little excessive?"
'No sir,' continued Ollie.
"No? And why not?" the senator asked.
"Because the lives of my family and I were threatened
sir."
'Threatened? By whom?" the senator questioned.
'By a terrorist, sir.' Ollie answered.
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that
much?"
"His name is Osama bin Laden sir." Ollie replied.

At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt. Then the senator continued.

"Why are you so afraid of this man?" the senator asked.
"Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I
know of," Ollie answered.
"And what do you recommend we do about him?" asked the
senator.
"Well sir, if it were up to me, I would recommend that
an assassin team be formed to eliminate him and his men from the face of
the earth."

The senator disagreed with this approach and that was
all that was shown
of the clip.

We would like to change the Netco directory name to UBS.

We will have to change the links to the NGP&L and anything else that links to files in Netco.  Let me know this morning if that will be a major problem for anyone.

Thanks

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

There is only 1 week left before moving into the new building.  There are two shredco containers located at EB3206E and in the freight elevator for documents that need shredding.

Remember:

1.  You can only move 6 boxes per person plus equipment
2.  Take home all IPAQ'S, Blackberry's, Palm Pilots and Laptops Friday 11/9/01 so that nothing is misplaced

4.  Clean out all Voicemails by 5:00 PM on Friday 11/9/01
5.  The new Enron Building will be closed to all until 5:00 AM on Monday Morning.  If you try to come up here, you will not be allowed in the     	building.
6.  Please give your User ID and Password to your assistant so she/he can make sure that everything is up and running for you on Monday 	morning.
7.  If you have a headset, please pack it.   They will not be installed until Monday morning.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

All,
 
For those of you who have not met  with UBS's Immigration Counsel, Kumar Kuman, please review the attached checklist and forward to me the relevant information.   Whilst Tindall & Foster  (Enron's Legal Immigration Counsel) will be able to forward most of this required documentation, it would assist with expediting matters if you are able to forward me this information.   My desk location is 3681c.
 
For those of you who have signed the release forms  (copy attached) your details on file  with Tindall & Foster will be forwarded to Fragomen (UBS Immigration  Counsel) shortly.
 
Please utilize me as your contact at this point and not the contact names on the checklist until/unless otherwise notified .
 
Kind Rgds,

 

Karen

            Clinicians have long suspected that a relationship existed between
            individuals who expressed anger and stroke risk. Indeed, medical literature
            has long described the so-called &quot;stroke-prone personality.&quot;

            difficult to conceive of since the statistical link between anger
            outbursts and hypertension as well as heart disease have been well

tEXas tailgatES talk

It was nice to see everybody play this weekend, and I do mean
EVERYBODY. I think that even I had a few carries, and my wife
had a sack. Good to see Major get one more score, and then
launch the ball 60 rows into the student section. There is no
football game this weekend, but there is plenty going on with
the Longhorns. The basketball season opens the T.J. Ford Era
on Saturday as the 'horns face giant killer Arizona, who already
has beaten #3 Maryland and #9 Florida, all with replacing 4
NBA-bound starters. If you are around Austin Saturday, get
yourself to the basketball game. Let's make it as hard to play
in the Drum as it is in DKR. There is that little matter of OU
going out to Lubbock to play Tech on Saturday as well. Get your
guns up, Longhorns.

59-0

What can I say about this? COMPLETE DOMINATION. Utterly complete.
The 'horns rolled up 606 yards total offense, all three quarterbacks
accounted for touchdowns, every single player who is not redshirting
played. The Defense seems to be getting nastier each week. The
Jayhawks had 67 yards of total offense. 67 yards. The closest
they got to the endzone was the Texas 48. Special teams standout
Michael Ungar outscored Kansas all by himself with a safety of the
Jayhawk punter who bobbled the snap in the endzone. Ungar beat
Kansas, 2-0. Texas also had another safety when Marcus Tubbs sacked
quarterback Mario Kinsey in the endzone, so I guess Tubbs beat
Kansas, too. If Texas wanted to score 100 on Saturday, they would
have made it so. The Jayhawks, in my opinion, quit on their
interim coach Saturday. They came out flat, played flat, and were
immediately flattened by a fired up Texas team ready to honor their
seniors by getting all of them in the game. The only down side to
this game was the kickoff coverage. Kansas seemed to get through
the initial wall and get the ball close to midfield almost every
time. I think this was due to two things:
1. The kickoff coverage team was looking for the knockout blow
that would make SportsCenter
2. They were all exhausted from covering 10 kicks in the game.
I think this problem was unique to the blowout, and will correct
itself by the Aggie game. If that's my worst complaint, then I
guess it's a good day.

The BCS, OU vs. Tech, Bowl Theories

Let's talk about the BCS for a minute. I've heard from some of
you that you don't like the BCS. I concur. I don't see how they
can tell a team it must play in a major conference to be eligible
(BYU will be snubbed due to this), and then amend the rules to
filter it "fairly". See, only 2 teams from one conference can
play in the BCS. The BCS was installed to eliminate the bias of
voters and make sure the best teams make it to the top 4 bowls.
With that being said, how can the NCAA use this system and then
turn around and say, "Oh, I'm sorry, but we can only have 2 teams
from one conference. 3 teams would allow too much money to go to
one conference, and that's not fair." Excuse me? Why does it have
to be fair here? Is it fair that Notre Dame has it's own TV deal
with NBC while better teams never get seen? They make A LOT of
money that other schools don't. Is it fair that one BCS-factoring
poll in Seattle has a 9-1 Pac-10 team at #2, and an Atlanta-based
poll has an 8-1 SEC team #2 (Oregon and Florida have both jumped
Texas in the BCS this week)? Maybe the Dallas Morning News should
start a BCS poll to even the score with it's own polling methods.
It's not fair anywhere in college football, it's not supposed to
be. The Big 10 shouldn't be guaranteed a team in the BCS if they
can't produce 1 in the top 10, penalizing another that has 3. No
conference should. College football is eliminate the weak and
the strong survive, so why be "fair" in deciding a national champion?
It is a shame that Texas, Oklahoma or Nebraska will get left out
so it will be "fair." I will get off of my soapbox.

Like I stated earlier, get your guns up, people. I am officially
jumping on the Texas Tech bandwagon now. One way, please, and
I'd like a window seat, maybe in the emergency exit row?
There's plenty of room for everybody. The Sooners are 8-point
favorites in Lubbock this weekend, but it should be fun to watch
Kliff with a K throwing it all over the place. We really NEED
this game. If Tech can pull this off, Texas plays the Aggies for
the right to go to Dallas. If Tech loses, then Texas has to hope
Nebraska beats OU in the Big XII Championship Game, and the 'horns
get the BCS nod over the 2-loss Sooners, which could happen.
Prepare yourself for this:
Texas will not make the BCS. If OU wins out and beats Nebraska
in Dallas, those 2 will certainly make it to the BCS. In that
case, Texas will end up in Dallas in the Cotton Bowl vs. an SEC
team (Ole Miss or Auburn). I know this isn't the place most of
us want to go, but it might be where we do go. Now Dallas isn't
exactly the end-of-season goal that Texas had in mind, but they
will shake it off and play where they are sent. Many of you
(and I do mean many) have proposed theories and explanations to
me as to why the 'horns would end up BCS-less: the soft schedule,
starting the wrong quarterback, the wrong tailback, not throwing
deep, not running up the middle, and on and on. Some of these
are solid, valid reasons that I cannot argue with, and some are
not.  Whatever the case, no one can change what has (might)
happened, but we can all affect the future.  The Cotton Bowl is
a major bowl, on New Year's Day, national telecast against a
quality team. I, for one, would love to rinse that Arkansas taste
out of my mouth. It will be hard for me to complain about an 11-1
season and a #3 final ranking after a big win over Ole Miss in
Dallas. I think most of you, like me, think of the sour ending to
the 1999 season and associate that with the Cotton Bowl. Don't.
It isn't 1999, and we will not be there because we limped to the
finish (like then), we will be there as arguably the best team in
the country and winners of 6 straight (no offense, Ags) who were
snubbed due to a technicality. Dallas is close. Dallas is fun.
Again, I will get off of my soapbox.

Here are the directions to the tailgate again for Texas A&M.
It will be located in lot 97, near Reed Arena (the basketball
stadium) and the Varsity Tennis Center. There is a map below.
When clicking on the map, lot 97 is located on John Kimbrough
Blvd, in grid D-4 (numbers are vertical, letters horizontal),
southwest of Kyle Field (in this map, north is the top right
corner, south bottom left, west top left, east bottom right).
If you go to the bottom left of the map, you can enlarge it.
John Kimbrough turns into Joe Routt after you cross Welborn
Rd (FM 2154). Kyle Field is located at Welborn and Joe Routt,
just right of lot 62. Lot 97 is about 2 ?  blocks southwest
of Kyle Field (straight left on the map) down Joe Routt/John
Kimbrough. It will begin around 9:00 am.

News and Notes:
* The defense got their 1st no hitter since last season, when
Texas shut out Houston, 48-0.
* The 67 yards allowed was the fewest since 1990. They also held
their 7th straight opponent to under 300 yards total offense.
* The Longhorns have now won 13 in a row at home. The average
score in those 13 games is 45-9, and Texas has scored over 40
points in the last 12 at DKR.
* The Texas offense racked up 606 yards on the Jayhawks. It was
the high mark for the season, and the most yards the 'horns have
produced since the 637 yard output last year against...
Kansas. Ouch.
* Cedric Benson continues to excel. Ced had 213 yards rushing on
28 carries and 2 touchdowns, and 1 t.d. and 68 yards receiving on
2 receptions. Ced's 213 broke the all-time 1 game freshman
rushing record for Texas (187, Charles Hunter, 1985), and his
281 all-purpose yards are 8th on the all-time list and 1st for
freshmen. Can you say Big XII Offensive Freshman of the Year?
* Chris Simms threw 2 touchdown passes on Saturday, breaking
Major Applewhite's school record of 20 (1999)for a season. Simms
now has 22 this season with 1 game to go.
* Roy Williams is good. Roy W moved into 2nd place on the all-time
touchdown receptions list. The 68-yarder marked his
15th career touchdown reception, 1 behind the leader
(Mike Adams, 16, 1992-96).
This guy is a sophomore. Yikes.
* Place kicker Dusty Mangum had 11 points (5 xp, 2 fg) to give
him 11 points for the day. Mangum now has 87 for the season,
making him the all-time leading scorer for a freshman
(Phil Dawson, 80, 1994).
* Wide out B.J. Johnson extended his streak of games with a
reception to 22, which is a record to start a career. He is 4
behind the all-time leader of consecutive games with a catch,
Mike Adams (1995-96).

Around the Conference:
* Nice offense, Ags. The A&M Aggies couldn't hold onto a 10 point
1st quarter lead in Norman, and were eventually blown out by OU,
31-10. The Aggie defense scored the only touchdown for A&M, as
the farmer offense continues to struggle. Once again, the A&M
offense managed 3 more points than I scored this weekend. No more
complaining about trick plays, Coach Bob. Coach Bob (and some
players) blew up after they lost to Nebraska on the reverse pass
for a touchdown to Crouch ("Trick Plays," they whined). No more.
The Sooners broke the game open with a fake field goal when pk
Tim Duncan caught a pitch and stumbled into the endzone. You hate
losing on trick plays, huh? Glass houses, big rocks, everybody
duck...
* Kliff Kingsbury went off in Stillwater. Kliff with a K threw
for 440 yards and 4 scores as the Red Raiders won their 3rd
straight, beating OSU 49-30. This week Coach Bob visits the
TortillaDome. Guns up, I tell ya!
* The Cornhuskers brought the Wildcats back to earth. Nebraska
beat KSU in Lincoln, 31-21. Kansas State lead at the half, the
1st time Nebraska has trailed at the break this season, before
the Huskers turned it on in the 2nd half to put them away.
* Colorado beat Iowa St, 40-27 in Ames, IA. Buffalo running back
Cortlen Johnson was the 1st back in CU history to rush for over
100 and have 100 in reception yards in 1 game. CU hosts NU on
T + 1 (day after Thanksgiving) for the right represent the North
in the Big XII title game.
* Baylor remains winless in the Big XII, after going to Missouri
and getting slapped around, 41-24. The slapper was Tiger wide out
Justin Gage. Gage had 13 receptions for 236 yards and 2 touchdowns,
and threw a t.d. pass on a reverse. Baylor qb Greg
Cicero threw 3 touchdown passes to Reggie Newhouse.
* The Big XII has 7 bowl-eligible teams right now, with a possibility
for K-St to win it's last 2 and make it 8.

This week's games (home team in Caps):

TEXAS TECH (6-3, 4-3) vs. Oklahoma (9-1, 5-1)
KANSAS STATE (4-5, 2-5) vs. Louisiana Tech (6-3)
KANSAS (2-7, 1-6) vs. Iowa State (5-4, 3-4)
BAYLOR (2-7, 0-7) vs. Oklahoma State (2-7, 0-6)

Everyone have a good weekend.

I'm still checking - I had an NC ticket for you but couldn't get ahold of
you in time.  Give me your work/home numbers again.

Thanks for getting the OU tickets to me on Saturday.  Do you have any
extras for the Kansas game?  I have Jayhawk relatives coming for the game.
Let me know.  The D and SP look pretty good.  I hope they are holding
something back on O.  We'll see.  Thanks.

In order for UBS Warburg to timely process your paycheck, I am requesting that all employee's accepting offers return any outstanding forms to my new desk location at  05852 on the 5th floor of ECS (Look for the Hamburg Flag) by noon this Friday  2/01/02.  This will prevent any benefit deductions from having to be "Double Deducted" on future checks.  Please attach a deposit slip or voided check stub to your direct deposit form.  Attached below are the forms needed for payroll/benefits, in case you did not turn these in at Orientation.  Lastly, please verify that your EHRonline home address is showing your current home address because all live checks will be mailed to your home residence. 

    

Thanks, Tony Jarrett

Hi Darron,

I noticed that you changed the term date on this deal. However, I didn't see it come through on the Domtar Industries side. Is this supposed to be charged to them again for September???

Elena,

Yesterday's list of in the money CP's did not change.  We will forward a list of out of the money CP's shortly.  We will also send IT the list so that they can begin moving them to another book.  There are appox 140 CP's so the move will take some time.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em=
ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for=
 Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w=
e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20
?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc=
hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,=
 which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be=
tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap=
pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan=
ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience=
d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou=
tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan=
ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv=
er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --=
 we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit=
h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus=
iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W=
ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov=
e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac=
ted users could not access their e-mail.
?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger=
ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus=
es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail =
is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop=
s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning=
 updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. =
 The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance=
 of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus =
product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w=
e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co=
mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t=
ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that =
will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th=
e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to =
get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las=
t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the=
 overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and=
 meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

This was sent to me by a friend who also has a  senior at CHS.  It was put
together by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto and is  truly profound.   Please
take the time to view it and make sure your  sound is on, the music makes
it.

Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical "Evangeline" (based on the
Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
of the WTC
disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
this.  It's worth it.
-- Jarja

A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
up!  Then send this on.  I did.

Subject:	The lone person from Congress that voted against US show of force 

I just wanted to pass on some information regarding the only person in Congress to vote against the US showing force regarding the terrorist attacks is NY and DC.  Barbara Lee a representative from California's 9th district(Oakland, Berkeley) voted against the resolution.  The final vote was 424-1.  The senate voted 98-0(2 members unable to get to Washington).  Barbara Lee has a history of doing this, she was also the only one who voted in '99 not to respond to the bombing of the US embassies in Africa.  She also was involved in trying to disrupt the confirmation process of President Bush(Al Gore had to tell her to refrain from speaking several times while certifying the electoral college votes).

If you would like to write her or call her to let her know your feelings, the phone number in DC is 202-225-2661 and in Oakland is 510-763-0370.  Her fax numbers are (DC) 202-225-9817 and 510-763-6538(Oakland).  I tried by phone, but every person in her offices' voice mailbox was full(probably full of outraged citizens).  So I faxed her a letter.  I urge you IF you are also offended by her vote, a slap in the face to all Americans and anyone who knew someone who lost their life in this tragedy, to call or fax a letter.  Representative Lee needs to know that she represents all Americans, not just the ones in her district.  Her email address is barbara.lee@mail.house.gov.

I also urge you if you were offended to watch the news, she will be up for reelection in 2004 and look for her opponents, Democrat and Republican.  

Whether you agree or not, you should make your voice heard.

Le Ugly American II

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------





Miss America, The lovely Kate Harmon, is sporting the swimsuit she chose for this evening's competition.  Miss Afghanistan is sporting the heavy smothering burqua, as chosen (well, required) by the oppressive Taliban regime.M
 iss America is a junior at Portland State University, where she's advancing toward her Master's degree in Bioethics. Miss Afghanistan is forbidden from receiving any education at all, and
cannot read or write.
Miss America has worked as a lab assistant at both the Oregon Health Sciences University and the University of Puget Sound. Miss Afghanistan is, well...
She's absolutely forbidden to work.
Ever.
Miss America's father is an engineer, and her mother works as a teacher. Miss Afghanistan's father was shot by a gang of Taliban militants, but her mother is alive and well, begging for scraps of bread since she cannot work or remarry.
Miss America will be wowing the judges tonight with her rendition of the Puccini Aria, "O Mio Babbino Caro". Miss Afghanistan has sadly bowed out of the talent portion of tonight's competition, as she's forbidden from singing (or even listening to) music of any kind.
During her reign as Miss America, Kate's travels have taken her all over America for personal appearances and fund raisers. Miss Afghanistan cannot drive or be out after dark, but she does leave her house occasionally when accompanied by a male family member.
Miss America is an advocate for breast cancer research. Miss Afghanistan hopes she does not get breast cancer, because she cannot be treated by a male doctor, and for all practical purposes has no access to medical treatment of any kind.
As Miss America, Kate is an eligible bachelorette - she can date, marry, or even divorce anyone she chooses. Miss Afghanistan is to be sold into an arranged marriage to a man who already has two wives, but she'll be treated to an execution by stoning if caught in the company of a male outside of her family.
To guard against possible skin cancer, Miss America takes advantage of sunblock when she's enjoying a relaxing day at the beach. To guard against possible skin cancer, Miss Afghanistan is required to paint the windows of her house black, and her pale skin hasn't seen a ray of sunlight in years thanks to that burqua.
Thankfully, Miss America's lovely choice of swimwear fully meets pageant standards -- she'd have otherwise been disqualified. Thankfully, the holes in Miss Afghanistan's facial mesh aren't too large -- she'd have otherwise been flogged.
As Miss America, Kate has the option of bearing as many or as few children as she likes one day, and in a country with one of the world's lowest infant mortality rates. Miss Afghanistan's several pregnancies will more than likely be forced, and one out of four of her children won't see their 5th birthday.
Miss America will likely be quite eloquent tonight - she's majoring in speech communications at PSU. Miss Afghanistan will likely be rather quiet tonight - she's forbidden from speaking in public.
Miss America is 21. Since the life expectancy for an American woman is around 80, she's still a rather young woman. Miss Afghanistan is also 21. But since her life expectancy is around 43, she's already middle-aged.

Darron,

Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?  Jeff wants hard copies, and I thought stationary would look nice.  If not, I can ask her.  Irena, right?  Thanks again.  Have fun in Chicago and tell Phillip hi for me!

Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the
great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was
going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

   Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
   little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
   works
   best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
   around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
   Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place
   in 2
   Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

This is not the regular email, that will come in a day or so,
and it will have all of the regular info, and the tailgate
information for the BIG XII CHAMPIONSHIP GAME!!!!!

Tickets
Let's talk about the game for a second. I'm sure you can imagine
the demand for tickets. The Big XII allots 16,500 tickets to be
divided among both schools, or 8,250 each. Cut 10% out of that
for the student draw, and it's down to 7,425. That's 7,425 tickets
for around 70,000 people looking to be in Dallas this weekend.
The 7,425 should raise some when Colorado doesn't sell all of
theirs (they usually don't), so that should push it up to 11,000
or so. That's 11,000 seats for around 40,000 people. These tickets
will be prioritized and dealt out as usual.You should know if you
are one of those who get select tickets or if you do not. If you
do, you should contact the Longhorn Foundation (ticket reservations
started on at 10:00 am on Sunday, November 25 and it ends at 7:00 pm
on Monday, November 26). If you are not one of these people, there
are options: School message boards, ticket vendors/outlets, want ads
in Norman and Lincoln, and most isp's have some sort of on-line
shopping sites where people sell any and everything. Believe me, I
have looked, tickets are EVERYWHERE on the Internet. Start with the
Longhorn links and work your way to the OU and NU sites, the ticket
outlets and on to the buy/sell sites and you will find them.

The Game
This is it folks. It may not have happened exactly like it was
supposed to, but what ever does? It's right there in front of
the Longhorns, and now they need to reach out and grab it. They
need your help. COME TO DALLAS. From the players, the coaches,
the Athletic Department- COME TO DALLAS. When CU came to town in
October, the game was close until the shovel pass. After that,
the crowd took over. Life was unbearable for the Buffalos after
that: they couldn't audible, they had false starts, delay of
games, etc... and they got blown out. That was the crowd. Dallas
is our town, this our state, Texas Stadium is OUR house. The Buffs
are the visitors in OUR HOUSE. Let's make it a Burnt Orange Dallas.
An endless sea of Texas shirts and hook'em horns, and a thundering
stream of noise to let the Buffalos know we mean business down
here in Austin. Let's turn Texas Stadium into the DKR-North.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. Who knows, by the time the game kicks off,
Florida or Miami may have lost, and you could be watching the
Longhorns celebrate Mack Brown's 1st Big XII Championship as the
players carry roses around and the crowd goes crazy in anticipation
of the National Championship game in Pasadena. Get yourself to
Dallas. It's right there.
A BURNT ORANGE DALLAS. DKR-NORTH. OUR HOUSE.

Hey Gang,

Just a heads up, but you may need to edit your Copy Physical Macro in your P&L's that are saved in the Netco/Regions folder... The changes were simply renaming sheets in the Macro... O

You have been slated for the next Excel/macro class.  Attendees will (most likely) be:
 
    Derek Bailey
    Darron Giron
    Brad Jones
    Kam Keiser
    Errol McLaughlin
    Scott Palmer
 
I anticipate starting the class the first week of October.  This is a little late in the year, with the holidays, to finish by the year end, so we may need January to finish up.  The meeting times will most likely be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 1pm.
 
The focus of the class will be learning basic programming/algorithm techniques, using Excel and VBA as a platform, with enough real world experiences and examples to keep your interest.  
 
I would encourage you to talk with Phillip Love and Anne Bike to get their feedback on the progress of the class so far (they are about 3 weeks into the class - although the first 2 or 3 sessions are pretty dry) and the time requirements.  There are bi-weekly reading assignments and exercises to complete.  In addition, I will assign a few projects along the way.  The time required should be very manageable unless something out of the ordinary comes up.
 
Consider your availability.  We are all busy, but I believe if you invest the time in the class it will be beneficial to you.  Let me know if something in your schedule will prevent you from devoting the required time so that I can find a replacement for your slot.  
 
I haven't decided whether to purchase your textbooks myself or make everyone responsible for obtaining their own.  I'll let you know when October is getting closer.
 
Let me know if you have questions.  I look forward to going through the class material with you.
 
Greg

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be a
little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon works
best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest somewhere
around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese place in 2
Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

Subject:	RE: Live Deals by Counterparty

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

Though many of you already know, today is my last day here at Enron.  I am leaving to pursue my culinary interests full time and have accepted a baking/pastry apprenticeship with the Deer Valley Resort in Park City, Utah for the winter season.  

I am happy to have spent the past 3 years working with such a fun and intelligent group of people. I sincerely wish all of you the best in your future endeavors.

Please don't hesitate to look me up if you are in the Park City area, vacation planning, or considering some radical career change like this...ha.  It would be great to see old friends up there.  Forwarding info is below:

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)

Darren,  

Just FYI.   I've had to pass on the Heartland termination to Richard Deming, who handles Physical deals.   I will get the Twister deal out this morning.  I've asked Richard to drop you a line when he send out Heartland.

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

Sung to "Those were the Days" from All in the Family...

Only hung with wealthy friends
Had the new Mercedes Benz
Means were justified by ends
Those were the days

Andy Fastow's Porsche was neat
With LJM it's off the balance sheet
We sure were loved by the Street
Those were the days

And you knew who you were then
Down the hall, my new girlfriend
Brother we could use a man like Jeffrey Skilling again

Didn't need no SEC
All my calls deep in money
Used to drink with Delaney
Those were the days.

The new corp id's xfer to UBS is being considered for this Sunday.  Hence, no start menu access to estate.  You will still have access to NT estate drive data to copy.
Does anyone have the need to retain a estate id for support estate application during the last week?  Exceptions have to be authorized.

Subject:	New Football Pool

There is a new Football Pool starting up for us losers who all got knocked out (and the loser Narsimha as well). Let me know what kind of interest there is in this pool. I was thinking of doing 2 pools, another Last Man Standing and this new one, described below:

This Friday, October 26 will be the Bid-Day. Everyone will submit a bid to me by 5:00 PM Friday morning listing exactly how much money they want to 'spend' in the pool. You can spend a minimum of $10, in $5 increments. You will 'spend' this money on teams that you think can or will win the Super Bowl. For example, I could bid a total of $25, putting $10 on the Ravens, $10 on the Rams, and $5 on the Broncos. 

We then tally up all of the money donated, and this is the pot. We then subtotal the money by team to figure out percentages. If I pick the Rams for $10, and the total amount of money put in for the Rams is $40, then if the Rams win, I get 25% of the total pot, since I contributed 25% of the winning amount toward the Rams.

We will not collect money until the end, so I don't have to be the bank. Now, is there interest in this pool? Is there interest in another Last Man Standing? Let me know who is interested, if you know anyone else, etc. We are also thinking about doing this for college b-ball at the start of the season. Format, of course, would be a little different. Let me know if anyone is interested in that as well.

We need to get this working, so let me know ASAP.

Brad

tEXas tailgatES talk

The bowls are over, and now the second season begins- recruiting.
Recruiting is it's own entity, with it's own characteristics. For
example, can you think of another instance where grown men
feverishly talk on the Internet about 17-year olds? Well, I mean
one that doesn't include jail time? People will spend several
hundred dollars in the next 4-? weeks on subscriptions to
recruiting sites so they can be the 1st to tell their friends that
Billy Ray Shasta from Cut N Shoot, TX is now considering Texas
and LSU instead of just Miami, or that the Aggies have a
guy who is really 6'3", 250 instead of 6'6", 290, and they padded
his stats. It's extraordinary, if you think about it. Adults with
jobs, spouses, kids and such stressing over where a teenager
they've never met from a town they've never been to is thinking
about going to school next fall. Have you heard of anything more
absurd? Let's move on to the bowl games, because I heard Billy
Ray might actually be 6'2" instead of 6'1" and could commit today,
so I have to get logged in...

47-43

Wow. What else can you say? Wow. That was one for the ages, folks.
Like I said, Washington can't run, right? One more reason to ignore
me. The Horns fall behind early, rally for the lead, get blown out in
the 2nd and 3rd  quarter only to storm back and win at the buzzer.
Unbelievable.  Saint Major played lights out in the 4th, and that is
good, since he did not in the 1st half. 3 interceptions, 1 for a
touchdown. Yikes. Had Simms done that, some of you would have gone
over the wall after him, noose firmly in hand. Glad you held off on
Major, since he rallied the team.   Quick sidenote: Chris Simms was
NOT laughing at Applewhite on the interception for a touchdown. It
is the job of the freshman quarterback to chart every play called
and what the outcome of that play is. This is harder than it looks,
because the charter does not have the benefit of a replay or
commentary to fall back on, only his eyes. Naturally, these frosh
will sometimes get behind, as was the case that Friday in San Diego.
Matt Nordgren was, at times, 4 to 5 plays behind, and begging for
help from Simms and Chance Mock, who repeatedly laughed him off.
The upperclassmen told the true freshman to tough it out, as they
had to do when it was their turn. The problem was since he was behind,
he was writing during the current play, and spent the entire 1st half
asking the other 2 what just happened. When Applewhite was picked off,
Nordgren ran up to Simms and Mock and asked what had happened, AGAIN,
and they BOTH busted up, as did 1 or 2 other players who were standing
close by, and it got caught on tape. THAT IS ALL. No one on the team
was upset, no coaches, nothing. Simms was not bitter, he was not
slouching, he does not have an attitude problem, he was not unprepared.
Nothing could be further from the truth.
Anything else you hear is rubbish.
The game was actually 4 games in one, here's what I mean:
The 1st quarter was all defense, with neither team able to score, as
both missed field goals.  The 2nd quarter was highlighted by 4
turnovers, three by the Longhorns.  Applewhite was picked off 2 times
in 3 possessions, one leading to a field goal and the other returned
36 yards for a touchdown by a guy who had been in 4 plays all season.
13- 0, Huskies. Texas answered with a 43-yard bomb from Major to B.J.
Johnson, and Vasher picked off UDub on the next series, and Applewhite
found Roy Williams on a 25-yard pass for another touchdown. 14-13.
Longhorns. The Huskies answered with a 76-yard drive to take the lead
again. 20-14, Huskies.
Applewhite was picked again as time was running
out in the half, and Washington got another field goal out of it, and
went in at half up by 9, with all of the points coming in the 2nd.
23-14, Huskies.  The 3rd quarter was brutal. As I sat in the stands
I really thought that the Horns had quit, to tell you the truth.
Washington rb Willie Hurst was cutting the defense to shreds, and hey!
Somebody cover that tight end! They seemed flat and listless, and I
was wondering if they really were still carrying that CU game around
with them. The Huskies could do no wrong, scoring 2 t.d.'s on long
drives with relative ease, and the Longhorns matched that with field
goals. Texas was down 36-17 at one point before hitting another field
goal at the end of the 3rd. 36-20, Huskies.  The 4th quarter was maybe
the most exciting and thrilling quarter of Texas football that I can
remember. The team seemed to come out of the fog and wake up. The
offense drove 52 yards and cut the lead to 10 on Matt Trissel's 2-yard
touchdown reception (yes, Matt Trissel), but Texas missed the 2-point
conversion. 36-26, Huskies. The defense needed a spark and a stop,
and they got both with Bam Bam. Derrick Johnson made the tackle on
the ensuing kickoff, stopped the running play up the middle for no
gain on 1st down, broke up a pass on 2nd down, and had the tide turning,
momentum shifting play of the game on 3rd down. DJ came clean on a
blitz and didn't exactly sack the quarterback as much as he ran over
him, planting him on his back about 11 yards behind the line of
scrimmage, and will be forever known to me as The Hit. This happened
in the endzone in front of all of the Texas fans, and it ignited the
crowd. Texas took over at their 46, and Roy Williams bailed out
Applewhite on the next play when he went up between 2 defenders and
snagged an ill-advised pass before getting creamed at the 16. It was
the best catch I've seen Roy make this year.  Big Ivan (who, I think,
realized this game that he is 6-3, 245) got his 1st t.d. of the night.
36-33, Huskies. The Hit seemed to rattle Washington on the next series,
and they looked out of sorts on 1st and 2nd down. On 3rd down, Pickett
tried to force a pass into te Jeramy Stevens, but Cory Redding tipped
it, it bounced off of him and Stevens before DJ came up huge AGAIN and
picked it off at the 25 and took it back to the 9. Applewhite hit
Scaife on 3rd and goal from the 5 for the lead with 6:00 to play. 40-36,
Longhorns. Texas held UDub to 3 and out, and tried to run out the
clock, but no dice. Washington took over with 3:20 to play, and promptly
went right through the Horns, and on 3rd and 1 from the Texas 34,
Willie Hurst went off tackle (and untouched) for a touchdown, much to
the horror of Texas fans, leaving 1:49 to play. 43-40, Huskies. I
really made an effort to watch the bench after that score. They didn't
look down. They were all clapping and jumping around, very upbeat.
You got the impression from the bench that it wasn't a matter of "if,"
but "when." Applewhite hit Johnson for 25 yards up to mid-field on a
beautiful timing play that had Major throwing the ball before B.J.
even broke. 3 plays later, same play, other side.  Applewhite connected
with Johnson for 32 yards to the Husky 5. This time B.J. made an over
the shoulder catch, Willie Mays style. Awesome.
Back to the I-Train to close the deal, as Williams carried on the next
two plays, scoring from the 1 with 38 seconds to play. 47-43, Longhorns.
UW took over near mid-field, but the defense held, and the game was
over. Easy enough, huh?
I have never seen anything like that before. I am glad I was there to
see it person.

Spring Practice/Outlook

Mack Brown has announced spring practice will begin February 26, with
the annual Orange and White game set for March 30. No time has been
set on the game, and these dates are subject to change. The Texas Exes
will have an open house the day of the Spring Game (more than likely),
just like regular game days in the fall. I will be sending another email
the week before that and give you all of the details about the game
(start time, what time we open here, etc...) and a preview of what to
expect and look for. I will also break down the recruiting class,
depth chart, schedule and prognosis for the fall. Here's the Cliff's
Notes version for now:
The outlook for 2002 is pretty good, if you ask me. Do not underestimate
what Winning that game in San Diego will do for the confidence and
psyche of this team. They got over a hump this year (the 10-win hump),
and look for that to do wonders for them. Confidence is everything in
sports. It took Nebraska's Tom Osborne 30 years to win a title, then
he wins 2 in a row, and NU won another in '97 and played for it in
'01. Same thing with Bobby Bowden,  26 + years at FSU with nothing,
and then since the Seminoles won it in '93,  he has won it once more
and played for it 3 more times. Texas hasn't won anything yet, but
they are on the right track. A better comparison would be Virginia Tech.
The Hokies were invisible before 1995, and then they beat Texas in the
Sugar Bowl, and have not looked back. They are a perrenial top 5 team,
and they EXPECT to win every game. Texas is there now.
Texas must replace 8 starters (3 offense, 5 defense), but that sounds
tougher than it is, in my opinion. 3 offensive linemen are gone, but
there is a pool of 17 to choose from. Derrick Dockery and Tillman Holloway
split time at starting guard this year, so both are considered
returning starters.1 will slide to the other side to replace Kirk-Hughes.
Beau Baker got significant time at center before his injury, and can
hardly be considered inexperienced if he wins the job left by Anderson.
The linebackers all graduate, but the leading tackler on the team is
Derrick Johnson, who will start wherever he wants in the linebacking
corps. The soph will be all Big XII next year. Reid Boyd played in
every game at lb last year, and will got the nod at one spot  as well.
Lee Jackson will return from turf toe to fight for the 3rd spot, and
he started for 2 years at ss before his injury. Dakari Pearson will
take the safety spot left by Ahmad Brooks. Dak started at the same
position in 2000. So what you're looking at is filling a void left at
tackle and corner- not easy, but not as uphill as you 1st thought,
right? The biggest challenge next year is the schedule. The Horns go
to UNC, K-State, Nebraska and Tech. A Crouch-less Nebraska, a crippled
K-State, and no freaks on the dl at Carolina (Peppers and Simms).
Again, not easy, but the hill isn't as step as it looks.

News and Notes:
* 11-2. I just like saying it. #5. It like that, too. The Horns finish
in the top for the 1st time since 1983. It's the 1st time since '82
they've done it by winning their way in
(1983, lost the bowl game to drop to 11-1).
* Texas set several school bowl game records:
Most points- 47 (42, Maryland, '78 Sun Bowl)
Total offense- 592 yds (513, Tennessee, '69 Cotton Bowl)
Most passing yards- 473 (368, Pitt, '87 Bluebonnet Bowl)
* The 19-point deficit is the greatest comeback in Texas football
history, beating the previous mark of 17 (OU, 1999).
* Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson set a Texas bowl record by being
the 1st Texas receiving duo to have a 100-yard reception day in
the same game. Roy had 11 catches for 134 yards, and B.J. had 6
for 157, each had a touchdown.
* Washington running back Willie Hurst had 608 yards rushing for
the season. He had 137 yards on 16 carries in the Holiday Bowl,
that's 8.6 yards per carry. Those are Play Station stats.
* Husky te Jeramy Stevens had 9 catches for 109 yards and a touchdown.
I think they all came on the same drive.
* The Longhorns only had 1 penalty in the game.

Around the Conference:
The Big XII went 3-5 in bowl games, here's how they went:

Rose Bowl- Miami 37      Nebraska 14
Yep. Pretty much like I thought. I said Miami would have won the NFC
East by Thanksgiving. In hindsight, I gave to much credit to the rest
of the NFC East.

Fiesta Bowl- Oregon 38      Colorado 16
Colorado's running game vs. Mike Belotti's brain. The brain wins, hand
down.  Goes to show you can beat anybody when they turn the ball over,
right Buffs?

Cotton Bowl- OU 10       Arkansas 3.
Don't make me watch this sort of thing again, Fox. I've seen shuffleboard
at retirement homes more exciting than this. New Land Thief Offensive
Coordinator Chuck Long said he was going to "open things up." Belated
Christmas presents don't count, Chuck...

Alamo Bowl- Iowa 19       Texas Tech 16
What? Where's all the offense, Mike? 16 points. There were a total of
7 field goals in the game. Fantastic. Leach is pushing Red Raider qb
Kliff Kingsbury for the Heisman in 2002. I don't anybody ever won it
as a holder, did they?

Insight.com Bowl- Syracuse 26       Kansas St. 3
I told you to look for the tell tale sign for the Wildcats- blowout
win or close loss.  Well, secret option C, blowout loss. They quit
this year, and if they don't regroup quick, '02 will not be pretty.

Independence Bowl- Alabama 14      Iowa St. 13
This went as I thought. I am a big proponent of the Cylcones.
They missed a field goal that would have won it at the end. If
they find a New running back, they could be trouble in 2002.

Yeah. The Aggies found a secondary bad enough to torch, and a team
with an offense worse than their own. It was close until the 3rd,
when the Ags pulled away. Dozens cheered them on.

More News:
* Coach Bob flirted with Florida to get himself a huge raise, Mack
Brown also got a raise, but the 40 Acres can afford it. OU Athletic
Director Joe Castiglione said the Sooners could not go over 2.5 mil
per year, because their department already runs in the red. Well,
they went over, WAY over. Coach Bob got point guard money when OU
came up with 20 mil over 6 years. Now the Sooners have to slash
budgets campus wide and jack up their ticket prices. Why didn't you
ask for a pony, too, Coach Bob? I'm sure basketball coach Kelvin
Sampson will be more than accommodating when his contract is up
next season and he gets nothing. 3.2 a year? Mike Martz, coach of
the soon to be Super Bowl Champion St. Louis Rams, wants a hefty
raise to bring his salary up to 3 million per. Management said NO
WAY. I guess OU knows something St. Louis doesn't.
* Roy Williams of OU went pro. Good. Go terrorize NFL teams and leave
us alone.

That's it. It's been fun this season. I will sign off until March,
when you'll get the preview for the Spring Game, depth chart and
season to come. I will talk to you all in a few weeks.

Dear Texas Ex,

Remember looking for career direction as a student?  Or searching
for that job after graduation?  Wouldn't it have been great to talk
to someone who actually worked in a field you were interested in, a
friendly face who had "been there, done that" and could offer you a
tip or two?

We're inviting you to become one of those helpful people by joining
the Texas Exes Career Network. By signing up on-line as a volunteer,
you may be contacted by fellow Texas Exes or current UT students
(though no more than 3 per month) and asked for informational
interviews to discuss your career and how you got to where you are.
(You are NOT expected to find jobs, only to discuss your field.)

To find out more about how you can show your UT pride by lending a
Longhorn hand, visit us at:

http://www.TexasExes.org/CareerNetwork

If you have any questions,
please contact us at career@alumni.utexas.edu or by calling
512-232-9178.

Hook 'em Horns,

Jennifer Duncan
Career Services Director

You are invited to attend the following presentation: 

PSIM: A Power Simulation Tool

PSIM is a proprietary model developed by Enron Research Group.

?	It takes Power, Gas, Weather and demand information into consideration and 
	uses Monte-Carlo simulation to assess the expected deal value and risk distribution. 
?	It evaluates complex electricity related contracts such
as Full Requirement  and load following contract. 
?	It also provides a valuation tool for power assets and asset management deals.
?	It works for both deal specific or portfolio issues.

In this presentation we will show how the model can be used to deal with various types 
of contracts, explain the model structure and point out further applications. 

Date:		October 30, 2001
Time: 	4:00 pm
Location: 	EB5C2
Presenter: 	Alex Huang

Importance:	High

Just got off the phone with Dave Forster.

Currently we are in dispute with Sempra over the terms & interpretations of the verbal & written agreement with Sempra regarding their transactions. They have terminated all agreements & all transactions. The only open 'issue' is the settlement of those transactions.

So, please add CP# 57508, Sempra Energy Trading Corp. to the list previously submitted.

Thank you,
Cyndie

Subject:	RE: Live Deals by Counterparty

We reconciled both lists. Attached are the counterparties who have terminated their Financial Agreements or transactions, as approved by legal, per the Master Letter Log. I did not include Sempra as they do not appear on the list & I have no further details at this time of their status. I've left a voice mail message for Dave Forster requesting additional information.

Alright guys, the 3rd Thursday is upon us.  We will have our first Thursday night poker game next Thursday Sept.20th at my house.  Let's put a tentative start time of 7:30.  Please let me know if you will be able to attend so that I can get replacements if they are needed.  Here are directions to my house:
1. Take I-45 South towards Galveston
2.  Take exit #29 - Clear Lake City Blvd.
3.  Go through 3 lights(not including the freeway overpass) and 2 stop signs(about 4 miles)
4.  Take a left on Noble Pine(across the street from Children's World Daycare)
5.  When Noble Pine dead ends, take a right on Towering Oak
6.  Take an immediate left on Cherry Oak
7.  This street dead ends into Sterling Wood Way, take a left
8.  I am the third house on the right 4435.

Subject:	Additional Move Related Information

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002

tEXas tailgatES talk

I hope everyone is doing okay, and you and your loved ones are safe.
The general feeling and attitude is a return to normalcy, so that's
what we are going to do here.

Off week

Texas was off last week, so there will be no mad scramble to
reschedule a game or any of the other chaos going on in the college
football world.

@ Houston - 8 pm - ESPN 2

Houston was on the way to Georgia to play the Bulldogs
prior to the cancellations.
The Cougars lost their opener to Rice, 21-14, back on September 1, and
have been off since. They gave up 354 yards rushing to the Owls, and
gained only 7 of their own. You might wonder, is Rice good? Well, they
had to stop a two point conversion and a pick off a pass in the last
minute to hold off Duke, 15-13, last week. Duke. At home.

___________________________________________________________________
It's tailgate time! The following is the schedule for all activities
for the weekend in Houston.

Wednesday, 9/19 - University of Texas Business Network Breakfast(UTBN)-
featuring Arnold Lipp of Mann, Frankfort, Stein & Lipp speaking on
"The Effects of Tax Relief."
The Junior League of Houston. 1811 Briar Oaks Lane. 7:00 a.m.

Thursday, 9/20- Thirsty Thursday
Little Woodrow's. 2301 West Alabama. 5:30 p.m. - ?

Friday, 9/21 - UTBN Golf Tournament
Blackhorse Golf Club. 12205 Fry Road. 8:00 a.m. tee-off

Friday, 9/21 - "A Night in Austin" featuring Jerry Jeff Walker with
Mark Winston Kirk.
Westside Tennis Center. 1200 Wilcrest Drive. 7:00 p.m.
Tickets are $45 per person.

Saturday, 9/22 - The tEXas tailgatES party - sponsored by
Miller Lite and Gallery Furniture.
In front of Melcher Gymnasium on Holman (next to Hoffeinz
Pavilion). 5:00 p.m.
No admittance fee, cash beer, food, etc.
For more information, click:
http://www.houston.texasexes.org/

For those of you needing bus information, the Texas Exes have buses
departing from Austin at 3:30 p.m. on game day. For more
details:
http://www.texasexes.org/news.php3?id=54

Texas/OU is right around the corner. In the coming weeks I will fill
you in on what will be happening. All of the details are listed in
the following link:
http://www.dallastexasexes.org/

Next week I will also have some more information on the plans for
Mizzou and Oklahoma State.

___________________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
?Last week I said look for Ivan Williams to become the starter at
tailback, and so it is true. The I-Train is averaging 5.7
per carry, so he's easily the best back out there right now.
?The Texas vs. Texas Tech game time has been set for 6:00 p.m. on 9/29,
and Fox Sports Network will carry it. It is as I thought it would be,
since every Texas/Tech game has been at night since 1995.
?Texas picked up it's 13th commitment of the season when Chase Pittman
pledged to Texas. The brother of Cole said, "My brother and I didn't
agree on everything, although we were best friends? We both wanted to
play for the best coach in the country." Chase said he knew at his
brother's dedication ceremony in Austin vs. UNC he was coming to Texas,
"Texas is home to me," he stated. Welcome home.

Around the Conference:
?Oklahoma starting defensive end Dan Cody has quit the team. Cody
suffers from a severe case of clinical depression, and has left to
take care of himself. Good luck, Dan.
?Former Longhorn recruit and Tennessee Volunteer Lynn McGruder has
found a new home. The Sophomore from Las Vegas was kicked off of the
ther UT football team for a felony charge of possession and intent to
deliver and sell marijuana. Kicked off of the team and facing jail
time, what new school did McGruder find to welcome him in?. That's
right, Oklahoma. Coach Stoops says he hasn't announced whether or not
McGruder will participate in football, but it seems inevitable. I smell
gunfire over c.d.'s and snowball fights that end in teargas and riot
police. Just like the 80's all over again. Welcome back, Sooner.

Talk to you next week. See you in Houston.

The All-Employee Meeting will be held Tuesday, Oct. 23, at 10 a.m. Houston time at the Hyatt Regency Houston Imperial Ballroom.  

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

If we can set up new ones for NETCO, I do not see why we need the old ones.

Do you want to keep any of the old TRV files for Netco for any reason.  We can create new ones once it is set up.

Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Enron employees may find the current circumstances stressful.  We want to remind you that Enron's Employee Assistance Program (EAP) is still available and currently offering services to assist you and your family.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending. These sessions are designed to address the challenges employees may be facing and to suggest ways to minimize the impact of stress on employees and their families. These sessions will be held on Wednesday, January 30 and Thursday, January 31 at the following times in EB32C2:
	
	9:00 am -- 10:00 am
	11:00 am -- 12:00 pm
	1:30  pm --  2:30 pm
	3:30 pm --   4:30 pm

No advance registration is necessary -- simply come to EB32C2 at the scheduled day and time that is most convenient for you.

Onsite Confidential Counseling / 24 Hour Hotline
EAP Counselors are available for individual, confidential appointments onsite in the Enron Building or at a variety of neighborhood locations.  Counselors are also available via telephone 24 hours a day, seven days a week for Enron employees in all locations.  The EAP counseling service is provided at no cost to employees and their family members.  To schedule an appointment or speak with a counselor, please call the onsite office at 713-853-6057 or the 24-hour number at 1-800-345-1391.

Informational Brochures

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Hey everyone,
We are having the map guys make maps for each state in our region including Ontario.  These are the items we would like to see on the maps.  If you can think of anything else you would like to see, please let me know today.  The sooner we get this list to them, the sooner they will begin building our maps.  Any input would be greatly appreciated.
Thanks.

Excellent.  Kai will work hard to get you the right deal.  That is the advantage of using him instead of a bank.  He has multiple lenders available to chose from.

Have a good day.

Thanks.  I wanted to see what refinancing to a 15 year would look like.  I just talked to him.  Things are wierd and I know it must be even worse moving to a new group.  I'm glad you like it over there.  I guess it's just wait and see.

I got your message, but I must have missed you.  Try calling Debbie Delgado @ x39183.  She is the ADMIN who sits next to me.

If you want to just call Kai directly about mortgages, his vital signs are below (just kidding).  The best place to reach him is at 713-816-1300.

Just wanted to see if you guys were interested in getting together for
lunch or after work in the next couple of weeks.  If so, send me what days
you already have something planned and I'll try to find one where we are
all free.  Also, indicate lunch or drinks.

Subject:	What Enron Did Right

A great editorial in the Wall Street Journal today.

Manager's Journal:
What Enron Did Right
By Samuel Bodily and Robert Bruner

11/19/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A20
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

  This is a rough era for American business icons. Subject to the
vagaries of age (Jack Welch), product failure (Ford/Firestone tires),
competition (Lucent, AT&T), technology (Hewlett-Packard and Compaq), and
dot-bomb bubbles (CMGI), managers and their firms remind us that being
an icon is risky business. The latest example is Enron, whose fall from
grace has resulted in a proposed fire sale to Dynegy.

   Once considered one of the country's most innovative companies, Enron
became a pariah due to lack of transparency about its deals and the odor
of conflicts of interest. The journalistic accounts of Enron's struggles
drip with schadenfreude, hinting that its innovations and achievements
were all a mirage.
   We hold no brief regarding the legal or ethical issues under
investigation. We agree that more transparency about potential conflicts
of interest is needed. High profitability does not justify breaking the
law or ethical norms. But no matter how the current issues resolve
themselves or what fresh revelations emerge, Enron has created an
enormous legacy of good ideas that have enduring value.


   -- Deregulation and market competition. Enron envisioned gas and
electric power industries in the U.S. where prices are set in an open
market of bidding by customers, and where suppliers can freely choose to
enter or exit. Enron was the leader in pioneering this business.

   Market competition in energy is now the dominant model in the U.S.,
and is spreading to Europe, Latin America, and Asia. The winners have
been consumers, who have paid lower prices, and investors, who have seen
competition force the power suppliers to become much more efficient. The
contrary experience of California, the poster child of those who would
re-regulate the power industry, is an example of not enough
deregulation.


   -- Innovation and the "de-integration" of power contracts. Under the
old regulated model of delivering gas and electricity, customers were
offered a one-size-fits-all contract. For many customers, this system
was inflexible and inefficient, like telling a small gardener that you
can only buy manure by the truckload. Enron pioneered contracts that
could be tailored to the exact needs of the customer.

   To do this, Enron unbundled the classic power contract into its
constituent parts, starting with price and volume, location, time, etc.,
and offered customers choices on each one. Again, consumers won. Enron's
investors did too, because Enron earned the surplus typically reaped by
inventors. Arguably, Enron is the embodiment of what economist Joseph
Schumpeter called the "process of Creative Destruction." But creative
destroyers are not necessarily likable, pleasant folks, which may be
part of Enron's problem today.


   -- Minimization of transaction costs and frictions. Enron extended
the logic of de-integration to other industries. An integrated paper
company, for instance, owns forests, mills, pulp factories, and paper
plants in what amounts to a very big bet that the paper company can run
all those disparate activities better than smaller, specialized firms.
Enron argued that integrated firms and industries are riddled with
inefficiencies stemming from bureaucracy and the captive nature of
"customers" and "suppliers." Enron envisioned creating free markets for
components within the integrated chain on the bet that the free-market
terms would be better than those of the internal operations. The
development of free-market benchmarks for the terms by which divisions
of integrated firms do business with each other is very healthy for the
economy.


   -- Exploiting the optionality in networks. In the old regulated
environment, natural gas would be supplied to a customer through a
single dedicated pipeline. Enron envisioned a network by which gas could
be supplied from a number of possible sources, opening the customer to
the benefits of competition, and the supplier to the flexibility of
alternative sourcing strategies. Enron benefited from controlling
switches on the network, so that they could nimbly route the molecules
or electrons from the best source at any moment in time to the best use,
and choose when and where to convert molecules to electrons. This
policy, picked up by others in the industry, created tremendous value
for both customers and suppliers.


   -- Rigorous risk assessment. The strategy of tailored contracts could
easily have broken the firm in the absence of a clear understanding of
the trading risks that the firm assumed, and of very strong internal
controls. Enron pioneered risk assessment and control systems that we
judge to be among the best anywhere. Particularly with the advent of
Enron Online, where Enron made new positions valued at over $4 billion
each day, it became essential to have up-to-the-second information on
company-wide positions, prices and ability to deliver.

   The unexpected bad news from Enron has little to do with trading
losses by the firm, but with fears among trading partners about Enron's
ability to finance its trading activity. In a world where contracts and
trading portfolios are too complex to explain in a sound bite,
counterparties look to a thick equity base for assurance. It was the
erosion in equity, rather than trading risk, that destroyed the firm.


   -- A culture of urgency, innovation and high expectations. Enron's
corporate culture was the biggest surprise of all. The Hollywood
stereotype of a utility company is bureaucratic, hierarchical, formal,
slow, and full of excuses. And the stodgy images of a gas pipeline
company -- Enron only 15 years ago -- is even duller and slower. Enron
became bumptious, impatient, lean, fast, innovative, and demanding. It
bred speed and innovation by giving its professionals unusual freedom to
start new businesses, create markets, and transfer within the firm.

   Success was rewarded with ample compensation and fast promotion, and
an open-office design fostered brainstorming. The firm's organization
and culture was by all accounts not a safe haven for those who believe
the role of a large corporation is to fulfill entitlements for jobs.
This was a lightning rod for the firm's detractors. And yet, it could
serve as a model for more hide-bound enterprises to emulate.

   Enron was a prolific source of compelling new ideas about the
transformation of American business. It created a ruckus in once-quiet
corners of the business economy. It rewrote the rules of competition in
almost every area in which it did business. It thrived on volatility.

   The proposed sale of Enron to Dynegy risks the loss of a major R&D
establishment, especially given Dynegy's track record as a second mover
following Enron's lead. Beyond what is likely to be a difficult and
time-consuming antitrust review, Dynegy's greater challenge will be to
find a way to make Enron's spirit of innovation its own. Or so we all
should hope, because prosperity depends on the ability of firms to
reinvent themselves and remake their industries.

I know we have moved this meeting already, but since I have very little info ( only what I read on Yahoo!)
I think we should wait till next week to meet.  So I am going to cancel.

I have given Leslie, Jeff , Stacey and Rita,  Enron BUCKS cards.  Make them buy you a drink.

Let me know if you hear anything.

Thanks for you patients and continued understanding.

FYI:
Barry had an abnormal stress test result  and was referred to a cardiologist.   He called me tonite to let me  know that the new   scan came out normal. Although he is very  careful about his food, his triglcs and chlosterol are  still  high...those Mayers genes again. 
 
Sara also had an appt with a cardiologist  today.  She has been having arryrhyimia ( sp?)...abornal heart beat.   She is now wearing a heart monitor for the next month, having blood work done,  etc.  Sounds like perhaps  a valve problem.  Serious enough for  sure, but sounds like she is in good hands and this is not something that would  cause a heart attack ( dr's words) .  I have not had time to look it up on  the net nor call Jessie, but plan to do both.  Will keep you posted.   Needless to say, she is pretty scared at the moment.

We're launching a new Emode! And we wanted to give you a sneak peek at
what's in store for you, your family, and friends.

We've added a great NEW address book that will make it easier than
ever before to share test results, polls, and even horoscopes with
friends and family! Now you can invite one, two, even ALL the names
in your address book to take your favorite tests and laugh about the
results.

And speaking of tests, why not take one our hottest tests right now?

-Which "Friend" are you?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40565
-What's Your Theme Song?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40566
-Which Movie Parent are You?
 http://www.emode.com/eredir?m=72001489&u=40567

We've got tons of new ones, too. Coming soon to Emode?

-> Special edition Halloween tests
-> Have You Reached Your Sexual Peak?
-> Can You Survive Kenya? (Emode's parody of Survivor III)
-> What's Your Lucky Charm?
-> Which "Soprano" are You?
-> Which Soap Opera Diva are You?

And if that's not enough, here's what you'll find in November:

More horoscopes to keep up with the stars
New quizzes and polls to see what you have in common with other
Emode users
Games to share with friends and family
Better access to your personal account, so you can compare test
results with friends
Contests that put you head-to-head with other people in the Emode
community
The one newsletter you can't live without

Emode's more fun than ever. Tests have never been such a blast.
Sharing's never been this contagious. So don't get left behind. From
Kirsten Dunst to Kate Hudson, everybody's talking about Emode!

Come join the crowd!

See you on-site!

Emode

Hope this finds you well this Holiday Season - and here are some  things to remember and keep us sane for 2002!    Darnell
1.  Throw out nonessential numbers. This includes age,  weight and height. 
2. Keep only cheerful friends. The grouches pull you  down. If you really need a grouch, there are probably family members that fill  that need. 
3. Keep learning. Learn more about the computer, crafts,  gardening, whatever. Just never let the brain idle. 
4. Enjoy the simple  things. When the children are young, if that is all that you can afford. When  they are in college, if that is all that you can afford.  When they are  grown, and you are on retirement, if that is all that you can afford! And if you  can afford grander things...still enjoy the simple things. 
5. Laugh  often, long and loud. Laugh until you gasp for breath. Laugh so much that you  can be tracked in the store by your distinctive laughter. 
6. The tears  happen. Endure, grieve, and move on. The only person who is with us our entire  life, is ourselves. 
7. Surround yourself with what you love, whether it  is family, pets, keepsakes, music, plants, hobbies, whatever. Your home is your  refuge. 
8. Cherish your health. If it is good, preserve it. If it is  unstable, improve it. If it is beyond what you can improve, get  help.  
9. Don't take guilt trips. Go to the  mall, the next county, a foreign country, but not guilt. 
10. Tell the  people you love, that you love them, at every opportunity. 
Remember,  Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the moments that  take our breath away.  May God richly bless you in the coming year.

Many of you have friends who are no longer with the company, so we wanted to provide you an overview of continuing efforts to assist Enron's former employees.

CAREER SERVICES
Last December Enron established a website to assist former employees identify jobs in Houston and throughout the United States.  Only former Enron employees and potential employers can access the site, http://careerservices.enron.com/

On this site, former employees can:
	? Post their resumes for approved employers to view
	? View job postings
	? Receive updates and information on career and community services available to them
As of January 25, 2002:
	? More than 1,300 companies had been approved to view resumes
	? Company recruiters had logged on more than 3,500 times to search for candidates
	? More than 600 jobs had been posted on the site

FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE
The Greater Houston Community Foundation
The Greater Houston Community Foundation (GHCF), in collaboration with the United Way of the Texas Gulf Coast, the Houston Area Urban League, Crisis Intervention of Houston, and Career and Recovery Resources, have established a fund to provide dedicated support for former Enron employees.  GHCF offers former employees counseling services and helps them work with mortgage companies, landlords and utilities to defer monthly bills while they are out of work.   If you are interested in making a tax-deductible donation to the GHCF, please call 713-268-6458 or mail donations to GHCF at 4550 Post Oak Place, Suite 317, Houston, TX  77027.  Checks should be made payable to Greater Houston Community Foundation and designated for the Enron Employee Transition Fund.  To receive assistance, former employees can call 713-533-4598, or outside Houston, 1-800-493-4598.  Lines are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account
A former employee has established the Enron Ex-Employee Relief Fund Account at the Humble Community Bank.  Visit the website at <http://www.eerfa.com> for more information or to make a donation.  Former employees can submit grant requests to eerfarequest@surfmk.com.

MDPC Transitional Assistance Program
Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church has created a Transitional Assistance Program open to both members and non-members who need assistance re-entering the workforce.  Right Management Consultants offers a series of two-day workshops for former employees on topics such as Career Assessment and Evaluation, Job Search Communication and Managing in a Time of Change.  Requests for limited and discretionary short-term financial assistance will be accepted from those who have participated in this program.  MDPC will offer a holistic approach to re-entering the workforce including family counseling and stress management. For more information, contact Memorial Drive Presbyterian Church at 713-953-2550, ext 180.

As you are aware that the ERMT database will be migrated to Oracle 8i on Saturday,
September 15. In order to start the process, TAGG/ERMS will be unavailable from 
8 p.m. (CST) Friday, September 14 to 10 p.m. (CST) Saturday, September 15.

We request all users of TAGG/ERMS to log-off by 8 p.m. (CST) on Friday, September 14.
If for some reason, you're unable to log-off by 8 p.m. on Friday, September 14, please contact
Francis Lim immediately at pager # (713) 285-7190.

We also request all of our users, both domestic and international, to please test
your regular TAGG/ERMS processes between 10 p.m. (CST) Saturday, September 15 to 2 a.m.
and (CST) Sunday, September 16.  If you encounter any problems with TAGG/ERMS during
that timeframe, please contact Francis Lim immediately at pager # (713) 285-7190.

If due to some unforeseen circumstances our users encounter major problems during the testing window of
10 p.m. (CST) September 15 to 2 a.m. (CST) September 16, we will  roll-back the ERMT database to the
existing Oracle 7.3.4 version.  It is very imperative that our users fully utilize the testing window of 10 p.m.
(CST) September 15 to 2 a.m. (CST) September 16.

Members of the TAGG/ERMS team will also be present on EB2512 to ensure that the database migration
happens smoothly.  Please note that if you encounter any problems with your testing on Saturday night,
please contact Francis Lim at pager # (713) 285-7190.

We will immediately communicate to everyone the results of this weekend's database migration.

Thanks so much for your support and cooperation!

With best regards,

Karima Husain
Project Manager, Gas Tactical

 Hi Bruce/Edward - 

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

 Hi Bruce/Edward - 

I am preparing the Termination for the Twister deal below.  Can you kill or zero out (whichever is applicable to the particular deal) the effected deals in TAGG, and also put a comment on the annuity leg to reflect which deals that payment references?  

VL2515.1 should be killed
Y05186.2 should be killed

VN4969.1 partially terminated (Oct 01- Nov 01 only)
VU4647.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)
Y05186.1 partially terminated (Oct 01 - Dec 01 only)

And the annuity leg Y05186.7 should have a comment reflecting that this payment is for the termination of these deals.  

Thanks,
Diane

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

tEXas tailgatES talk

Winning feels good, doesn't it? The road trip to Stillwater was fun.
We had several hundred people at the tailgate, and by the middle of
the 3rd quarter, I think the Texas fans outnumbered the Oklahoma
Aggies. All I will say about the booming Metropolis of Stillwater is
I'm glad we do not return for 2 years. Brutal. Absolutely brutal.

45-17

Texas looked a little sloppy early, but righted the ship to cruise
on course. Oklahoma State had a solid game plan, but the Texas
adjustments and superior talent overwhelmed the Cowboys. The running
game re-appeared this week, and freshman stud-to-be Cedric Benson got
his 1st career start. He did not disappoint. El Ced finished the day
with 131 yards on 31 carries. His solid running opened up the passing
lanes for Simms and Co., who picked apart the overmatched OSU secondary
to the tune of 5 touchdown passes. All in all, the much-anticipated OU
hangover did not come to pass. Texas took care of the weaker opponent,
as they should have.
___________________________________________________________
Colorado
2:30 pm
ABC telecast

ESPN Gameday (the radio edition, not the t.v. show) will be here for
the game. Texas comes in ranked #8, and CU comes in ranked #14. This
is a game both teams need to validate their seasons. Texas needs to
show the world, and themselves, that they can indeed win a big game.
A win over the Buffaloes would catapult the Longhorns forward to a
probable 10-win season (no offense, Aggies), while a loss could send
this team into a tailspin. Colorado, much like Texas, is a different
team at home. They have beaten some quality teams in Boulder, but now
must show they have grown up and can win on the road. This is a HUGE
game. If the 'horns hold serve, they should sail into College Station
9-1, with a BCS birth on the line. This will not be easy. Texas has
not seen a team that pounds the ball like CU does. The Buffs are #2
in the Big XII/#13 in the nation in rushing offense (224.7 ypg).
National t.v. coverage, temperature in the high 70's, 2 top 15 teams
getting after it? I wouldn't want it any other way.


___________________________________________________________

There will be no television for the Missouri game. The Texas Athletic
Department has asked the Missouri A.D. to allow a pay-per-view
broadcast for next week. The final decision has not been made
(as of Wednesday morning). If the game is on pay-per-view, it will be
at 2:30, if it is not, it will be at 1:00. For those of you going to
Columbia, the tailgate party will be at the Holiday Inn in Spanky's
Sports Bar. I will have a start time as soon as I know a game time.
It will be posted on the link below:

http://www.texasexes.org/chapters/TexasTailgates.html

The Baylor tailgate will be at George's Party Zone on Dutton Avenue
(just east of Floyd Casey Stadium) and is hosted by the Waco Texas
Exes. Start time will be announced next week. Plans for the Texas
A&M game are still being discussed. Click the link below for more
information.

___________________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* Chris Simms tied a school record with 5 touchdown passes vs.
Oklahoma State (James Brown-'94- vs. Baylor). It's amazing what a
running game will do for you.
* Cedric Benson now ranks #10 on the all time single-game freshman
rushing record with his 131 yards. Charles Hunter holds the record
with 187 (Houston - '87).
* Benson was also named the starter for the CU game. His reign begins.
* Look for Texas to run the 3-4 and the 4-3 this week. The way the Buffs
run the ball, Texas will show them many different looks.
* Last week Texas A&M threw for 334 yards vs. CU. 334 yards from a
team that HATES to throw. Look for the 'horns to throw early to set
up the run.
* Injury update: Kalen Thornton (knee) is returning to practice this
week. The defensive end should be ready to this weekend. The news is
not as good for another de, O.J. McClintock (lacerated arm). Look for
him to redshirt this year, unless they absolutely must have him.
* Colorado starting cb Roderick Sneed is out for this game with a
pulled hamstring, and his backup, Phil Jackson, has a broken hand.
3rd team corner on Roy/B.J./Sloan/Tony/Kyle? Nice.
* Some Buffalo news you may not have heard: Jashon Sykes, the
All-America candidate at middle linebacker, is done for the year with
a herniated disc. His backup, Joey Johnson, was the Defensive Big XII
Player of the Week last week.

___________________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Nebraska beat Baylor, 48-7, but that's not the story, this is:
the Cornhuskers had 641 yards rushing in the game. They had 4 backs
go over 100 yards. 641 yards in one game. That's almost twice what
Baylor has for the season (374).
* Texas Tech whipped the Purple Wildcats from Kansas St, 38-19. Kliff
Kingsbury threw for 409 yards and 4 touchdowns for the Red Raiders,
the most passing yards ever allowed by K-State. The Wildcats are
circling the drain. They are 0-3 in conference and 2-3 overall.
They draw the Aggies this week, while Tech gets a head check at
Nebraska. Good luck, Raiders.
* Texas A&M seems to run into the same wall when they don't play well:
turnovers from sacks. Quarterback Mark Farris has fumbled 3 times
after being hit from the blindside, and all 3 have been returned for
touchdowns, the last one vs. Colorado.
* OU has named Jason White their starting quarterback, benching
ineffective Nate Hybl. A quarterback controversy, how interesting.


Have a good weekend. See you at the Alumni Center on Saturday!

                          to spend excessively? There is in fact a name for your
                          (our) condition - oniomania. Binge shoppers are categorized
                          with compulsive disorders, as well as with those suffering
                          from anxiety and depression. Medical research hopes

My apologies for canceling today's class.  I am at home sick.  Today's class was only to last 15 mintues or so and provide a brief introduction.
 
If you don't already have your book, please get it today from the box on the floor by my desk.  Read chapter one and do the exercises for Wednesday.
 
The first part of the book is fairly slow reading, but lays some important groundwork.  Also, my recommendation is that for the first couple of chapters, you do both the Excel and Word examples.  The extra practice with Word will help you discover more about VBA that will be useful to you in future Excel work.  After the first couple chapters, the author shifts largely towards Excel.
 
If you set aside a dedicated time to work on the class material, it shouldn't take you that long to complete.  Also, my suggestion for you, to get the most out of the class, is to do your "homework" BEFORE the morning of the class.  This gives you time to think about the concepts and go back and review if necessary.  Also, I would encourage you to try and do each of the exercises at the end of the chapters.
 
Let me know if you have questions.
 
Sorry again for missing the class.  This won't be a common practice, I promise!

tEXas tailgatES talk

Back on track. Texas is now 6-1, and ranked #7 in both polls.  I
said after the OU game that if UT took care of their business,
things would shake out for them. It's sort of setting up that way,
isn't it? 2 weeks ago, Texas was #11, with 10 unbeatens in front
of them. In the last 12 days, half of those teams have lost. Of
the 6 now in front, 4 play each other in the next 3 weeks, and
the other 2 have VERY tricky games (#6 Florida vs. #19 Georgia,
#4 UCLA vs. #11 Oregon). The 'horns are right there in it.

41-7

Hello, shovel pass. Texas won a big game. Okay, not THE big game,
but A big game nonetheless. The Buffaloes swaggered in here thumping
their chests about their rushing game and physical defense, and
left with hat in hand and avoiding eye contact. Texas forced 4
turnovers, tying a season high (OSU), shutting down the Buffalo
ground game and knocking down CU defenders to the tune of 425
yards total offense. On to the shovel pass.

Most of you have never seen Texas run the shovel pass, because they
only did it a few times in the Spring. If you did see them try it
in the Spring, your heart was in your throat (like mine) when they
ran it on their own 5, because it was never what you would call a
"good play" in practice. I think they tried it 4 times, and totaled
something like minus 9 yards and one interception. Nonetheless,
Simms sucked them in, Ced got the corner, and Roy sprung him to
mid-field. Two plays later (One being a fade to Roy that was maybe
Simms' best throw this year), touchdown. That was absolutely a
soul-stealing drive. If there is a team in college football better
at putting someone away right before the half than Texas, I haven't
seen them.

Missouri
1:00 pm
No T.V.

Well, the Athletic Department tried to get this one televised for
you. The reason the pay-per-view didn't work is the way it was set
up. Texas residents would pay to see it, but it would be regionally
televised in Missouri. That sounds fair, right? Okay, now no one
gets to see it. Oh well, listen to the Texas game and watch OU play
Nebraska.

For those of you going to Missouri, it should be fun. Mizzou has
played pretty well in the last 3 weeks, but it's hard to get scared
of a team that lost to Bowling Green AT HOME. Bowling Green? Are you
kidding me? Anyway, look (for those not going, listen) for Texas to
run, run, run this week. Missouri cannot stop the run (allowing 180
ypg), so Texas will exploit that. Last year Roy Williams ran loose
in the Tiger secondary, and Applewhite found him repeatedly
(7 catches, 87 yds). I see no reason for this to change, particularly
when Mizzou will have to put 8-9 on the line of scrimmage to stop
the run.

The tEXas tailgate will be at Spanky's Sports Bar in the Holiday Inn
in Columbia. The tailgate will begin at 9:30 am, and run until roughly
12:30 pm. The bar will be open, and snacks from the bar menu will be
available, but meals will not. There is a restaurant right next door
(in the hotel) that will be open for breakfast. Here's the hotel
information:

HOLIDAY INN SELECT COLUMBIA
2200 I70 DR SW

Please call if you need any more information or directions.

The Baylor game time has been set. 11:30 am, Fox Big XII Game of the
Week. The tailgate, hosted by the Waco Texas Exes, will be at George's
Party Zone, on Dutton Avenue, east of Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco.
Start time is still TBA, but I'd say between 9:00 - 10:00 am.

______________________________________________________
News and Notes:
* D.D. Lewis recovered his 10th career fumble in the 1st half. He
now is the career leader for recovered fumbles, passing Tim Campbell
and Oscar Giles. To boot, he started his 45th consecutivegame, tying
him for 2nd career consecutive starts with Lance Gunn and Anthony
Curl (both 89-92).
* Texas forced 4 turnovers for the 2nd straight week. The Longhorn
turnover ratio is plus 7 so far this year.
* The defense is ranked #7 nationally, and #1 in the conference,
averaging a shade under 200 yards allowed a game. Look for these
numbers to be even better next week.
* Texas kicker Dusty Mangum is tied for 10th nationally and is #2
in the Big XII in scoring with 63 points.
* Missouri receiver Justin Gage is #2 in the Big XII with 45 catches
and 518 yards with 3 touchdowns. He will get locked up with Jammer
this weekend.
* The Tigers have found their passing game in Big XII play. The last
3 weeks, qb Kirk Farmer has thrown for 637 yards and 7 touchdowns.
In the 1st 3 games, 3 Missouri quarterbacks combined to throw for
only 399 yards and 3 t.d.'s. Must have been that stout Bowling Green
defense. Don't mess BG, or you, too, will face the Falcon wrath.
* Kicker Brad Hammerich is 8-9 on field goals, missing only from 50+
yards, and 53-54 on P.A.T.'s for his career. Hammerich connected on
the game winner at Oklahoma State in the 3rd overtime 2 weeks ago.
* Linebackers Jamonte Robinson and Sean Doyle might be the best
linebacking duo in the country. Doyle leads the Big XII with 77
tackles, and Robinson averages 14 tackles per game (he is 6th on
the all-time tackles list at Mizzou). Sean, Jamonte, this is
Cedric Benson.

______________________________________________________
Around the Conference:
* Will somebody get K-State a doctor? More like a mortician. The
Texas A&M Aggies went up to the Little Apple and snuck out with a
win. The Wildcats were stopped on the 5 on 4th and goal, and the
Aggies left with a 31-24 road victory. Nice job, Ags. Bye, bye,
Wildcats.
* Tech went to Lincoln and played well. The Red Raiders lost by
10, but played Nebraska even through 3 ? quarters. OU looked lack
luster in a 33-17 win over Baylor in Norman. You think these 2 were
peeking around the corner at each other?
* Game of the day: Lincoln, NE. Sooners vs. Bug Eaters. This should
be a good show.
*2nd best game of the day: Iowa St. at Texas A&M. The Aggies will
take care of business here...or will they? The Cyclones are 5-1,
only losing to Nebraska. Running back Ennis Haywood had 196 yds
rushing and 3 t.d.'s in the 28-14 win over OSU. Careful, Ags, or
we'll see you whining about this game on "Sidelines" next week.


Everyone have a good weekend. Hope to see you at Spanky's in Columbia.

Greetings Darron,

Simple format - simple wishes - important hopes for you and yours.

Happy New Year to you from your friends at Audio Concepts Inc. (ACI)!

Darron Giron, you should have received the latest issue of the
ACI Confidential E-Newsletter early in December.
If you didn't receive it, please let us know by
emailing me at:   confidential@audioc.com

It's official, Audio Concepts, Inc. is 25 years young! We're proud to say
that ACI is thriving. Not only has our entire product line been completely
revised within the last 12 months, we're adding four brand new and very
exciting speaker systems. Many of you have already taken the opportunity to
pre-order these leading-edge systems. For the latest news on the Veritas,
Talisman, Jaguar LE and LFM go to:
http://www.audioc.com/speakers/prelim.htm


We're in the process of a complete 25th Anniversary website revision. There
may be some short/temporary down times. Check out the clean new look at
http://www.audioc.com


January through May is traditionally our busiest time. Why? Smart people
like you decide to invest their after-Christmas funds in quality
home-entertainment. Many people also take advantage of tax refunds to
improve their stereos and home-theater systems. There is no better audio
investment than handcrafted speaker systems from ACI, excellence beyond
expectation.

The base price on the award winning Titan II LE powered subwoofer will go up
by $50 effective Jan. 20. The new base price will be $1150. Pocket that $50
by ordering this legendary sub before January 20.

Looking for absolutely incredible bargains? Don't forget to frequently check
our Demos and Specials page. These systems are sold with full warranty.
http://www.audioc.com/sale/spec1.htm

We sincerely hope that 2002 will prove to be a wonderful year for you and
all those you care about.

Our normal Confidential Newsletter has bright colors and attachments.
But 25 years ago, like this particular simple plain EMail,  ACI was simple and plain.
We hoped and desired for our 1st customer - now 25 years later our customer
numbers are in the 30,000s and aiming to 40,000 .  Like a newborn
business or person, we learned.   Our capabilities and capacities have grown
from those lowly beginnings.  But like any 25 year old - we still
have much growing and learning for the future.  We hope you'll continue
to grow and learn with us in 2002.  We're hoping it will be a great year for our
country, for our world, allies, and freedoms, for you and for us.

Darron from all of us at ACI, may your next year be more pleasant,
safe, and fruitful than the last.

Cordially,


Alex
ACI Confidential Newsletter and Mailing Coordinator

Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?  Jeff wants hard copies, and I thought stationary would look nice.  If not, I can ask her.  Irena, right?  Thanks again.  Have fun in Chicago and tell Phillip hi for me!

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

The potential use of biological agents such as Anthrax in a terrorist attack continues to raise concerns worldwide.  Here at Enron, the mail center and Business Controls/Corporate Security have already implemented safeguards so that all mail entering the Enron buildings will be screened in accordance with procedures for identifying suspicious packages.  We are also in touch with the U.S. Postal Service and the Centers for Disease Control to ensure we have the most complete and up-to-date guidance for handling any possible Anthrax exposures.

However, should you receive an envelope or package that you do not feel comfortable opening, please contact Corporate Security at extension 3-6200 and we will screen it again.

To provide Enron employees with a better understanding of  Anthrax and the potential danger it poses, we have posted a bulletin on the Corporate Security intranet site http://home.enron.com:84/security/002_bull_001.html that includes links to the CDC and USPS resources.

The Cost of  Children 
I have seen repeatedly the breakdown of the cost of 
raising  a child, but this is the first time I have seen the 
rewards listed this way.  It's nice, really nice! 
The government recently calculated the cost  
of raising a child from birth to 18 and came up with 
$160,140! That  doesn't even touch college tuition. 
For those with kids, that figure  leads to wild fantasies about 
all the money we could have banked if not for  (insert your child's name 
here). 
For others, that number might confirm  the decision to remain childless. 
But $160,140 isn't so bad if you break  it down. It translates 
into $8,896.66 a year, $741.38 a month, or $171.08 a  week. 
That's a 
 mere $24.44 a day! Just over a dollar an hour.  
 Still, you might think the best financial advice says don't  
 have children if you want to be "rich". It is just the opposite.  
 What do you get for your $160,140? 
Naming rights.  First, middle, and last! 
 Glimpses of God every day.  
 Giggles under the covers every night. 
 More love than  your heart can hold. 
  Butterfly kisses and Velcro hugs.  
 Endless wonder over rocks, ants, clouds, and warm cookies.  
 A hand to hold, usually covered with jam. 
 A partner  for blowing bubbles, flying kites, building 
 sandcastles, and skipping  down the sidewalk in the pouring rain. 
 Someone to laugh yourself  silly with no matter what 
 the boss said or how your stocks performed  that day. 
 For $160,140, you never have to grow up.  
 You get to finger-paint, carve pumpkins, play hide-and-seek,  
 catch lightning bugs, and never stop believing in Santa Claus.  
 You have an excuse to keep: reading The Adventures of Piglet  
 and Pooh, watching Saturday morning cartoons, going to Disney  
 movies, and wishing on stars. 
 You get to frame rainbows,  hearts, and flowers under 
 refrigerator magnets and collect spray  painted noodle 
 wreaths for Christmas, hand prints set in clay for  
 Mother's Day, and cards with backward letters for 
 Father's  Day. 
 For $160,140, there is no greater bang for your buck.  
 You get to be a hero just for retrieving a Frisbee off the  
 garage roof, taking the training wheels off the bike, removing a  
 splinter, filling the wading pool, coaxing a wad of gum out of  
 bangs, and coaching a baseball team that never wins but always  
 gets treated to ice cream regardless. 
 You get a front  row seat to history; to witness the first step, 
 first word, first bra,  first date, and first time behind the wheel. 
 You get to be  immortal. 
 You get another branch added to your family tree, and  
 if you're lucky, a long list of limbs in your obituary called  
 grandchildren. 
 You get an education in psychology,  nursing, criminal 
 justice, communications, and human sexuality that no  
 college can match. 
 In the eyes of a child, you rank  right up there with God. 
 You have all the power to heal a boo-boo,  scare away 
 the monsters under the bed, patch a broken heart,  
 police a slumber party, ground them forever, and love 
 them  without limits, so one day they will, like you, 
 love without counting  the cost. 
 ENJOY YOUR KIDS (and grandkids) !!!!!!

Last night's winning lottery ticket was sold in Deer Park!   27 mil..  no,
i did not have it.........................

Also - saw Al and talked on the phone to Nita - Nita is at Enron till the
end of the month.  Glad Darron has found work elsewhere.  He will be ok.
He is a bright guy!  How is he taking all this?  This kind of stuff lets us
all know how very fragile and uncertain life really is...  and how much of
our success is based on how we see it...   or is how we see how we see it
an illusion too...  who knows????  I am just glad he is ok.

It is unbelievable how the management (both past and present) think they can run a business with no regard for the customer.  They have to be one of the worst marketing organizations in the world.  They have a great product, but don't have a clue on how to promote it.

Another big news item : PPI used to be the headline sponser.  They left a few years ago and FedEx came on board.  Rumors are rampant that FedEx will be leaving soon.  You have to wonder what it takes to make the light go on for some people.

It is extremely frustrating to try and continue to be a fan.

Darron,

I have created the Twister termination and will get Fred LaGrasta to sign it this afternoon. (we're not allowed to sign financial terminations down here)

Diane

PS - Richard is having some trouble with the Heartland deal.....he's getting approval from legal on the Termination template (it's a little different on the physical side).  FYI.

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

crowded around noon, so let's meet at 11:45 so that we may get a table.  If
I'm not there go ahead without me. I've got a meeting that may last til
noon.  I'll catch up with you after that.  Also, Giron will be in lovely
Oklahoma (no doubt some punishment for his role in the $1.0BN in write-offs
they took) and won't be joining us.

See you tomorrow.

As a follow-up to the Enron Net Works All Employee meeting on October 5, we are pleased to announce a number of organizational changes.

Anthony Dayao will continue as CIO for EES Systems.  In addition to his current responsibilities, Anthony will assume responsibility for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system.
 
Jeff Johnson will move into the new role of CIO for EGM/EIM Systems.
 
John Paskin will transfer to the Houston office from London to take up the new role of CIO for Corporate Systems. His group will include the ISC, Enterprise Portal, Intranet Solutions, CRM strategy, Treasury Systems, Development Support and will matrix into HR IT Systems.
 
Continuing in their current positions are Inja Chun, CIO for EBS Systems; Paul Freeman, CIO for Enron Europe; Jay Webb, CIO for eCommerce, which now includes Commodity Logic Systems; and Jenny Rub, CIO for Infrastructure.

Hi Richard,

I only received response from Matt Brown.   I will send an email
this afternoon before I apply the changes.

FYI, I will make the changes to test (egsdevel) and stage (ermttest_ded) first,
before I make change to production database.

I am waiting on approval from Jeffrey Gossett.

Hi Richard,

I will be responsible for adding holidays ( to holidays table) and
removing holidays from business days tables.

I checked NYMEX.com, they didn't publish 2002 holidays yet.
I requested  via email(exchangeinfo@nymex.com) for 2002 holidays.

To what year in the future do you want to add  MLK and Presidents Days ?

>11:55 I decide that we're going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.
>
>11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to go fuck himself.

>12:15 The UT band walks by on the way to the Alamodome. We're on the second

>
>We're hooting and hollering like wildmen. The band doubles back to the

>
>Texas. AWESOME MOMENT.
>
>12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity, 50-100 grown men are bumping chests

>with one another, each and every one of them now secure and certain of the

>fact that we are going to kick the shit out of Nebraska.

>
>1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome, somehow managing to stuff the
>

>
>1:47 I am in line surrounded by Nebraska fans. They are taunting me. I am
>
>taunting back, still certain that we are going to kick the shit out of
>
>Nebraska. I decide to challenge a particularly vocal Nebraska fan to play

>

>I call Southwest Airlines and buy two tickets to Phoenix, non-refundable

>
>non-transferrable. Price: $712. He is humbled. He lowers his head in
>
>shame. I raise my cell phone in triumph to the cheers of hundreds of Texas
>
>fans. I am KING and these are my subjects. I distribute the 11 beers in my
>
>pants to the cheering masses. I RULE the pre-game kingdom.
>
>2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence, I open the Traveler and pour my
>
>first stiffy.
>
>2:45 I notice something troubling: Nebraska is big. Nebraska is fast.
>
>Nebraska is very pissed off at Texas.
>
>3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends. 9 yards total offense for Texas.
>
>Zero first downs for Texas. I'm still talking shit. I pour another stiffy
>
>from the Traveler.
>
>3:36 Four minutes to go in the first half: the Traveler is a dead soldier.
>
>I buy my first $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. While I am standing in
>
>line, a center snap nearly decapitates Major Applewhite and rolls out of
>the
>
>end zone. Safety.
>
>3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas 0. I wish I had another Traveler.
>
>4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska fan in the bathroom at halftime, I
>
>attempt to revive the classic Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
>
>"Hey, buddy, niiiiiiiiice cock." He is unamused.
>
>4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from the Alamodome merchants. I share my
>
>beer with two high school girls sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they are
>
>equipped with a flask full of vodka. I send them off to purchase Sprites,

>so that we may consume their vodka. I have not lost faith.
>
>Nebraska is a bunch of pussies.
>
>4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting behind me have fled for their lives.
>
>I purchase two more $5 beers from the Alamodome merchants.
>
>5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I am beginning to lose faith. This
>
>normally would trouble me, but I am too drunk to see the football field.
>
>5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm sorry, sir. Those tickets have been

>
>5:37 I try to start a fight with every person behind the concession

>
>As it turns out, the Alamodome has a policy that no beer can be sold when

>
>5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in my chair in defeat. All of a sudden,

>the Texas crowd goes absolutely nuts.
>
>"Whazzis?," I mutter, awaking from my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
>
>Alas, the answer is no, we were not winning and we did not score. The

>largest (by far) cheer of the day from the Texas faithful occurred when the

>handlers were walking back to the tunnel and Bevo (the Texas mascot)
>stopped
>
>to take a gargantuan shit all over the letters "S", "K", and "A" in the
>
>"Nebraska" spelled out in their end zone. I cheer wildly. I pick up the

>
>6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as I walk back to the truck. I would
>

>October, they would be playing Florida State for the national championship.
>
>6:30 Back in the car. On the way back to Austin for the basketball game.
>
>8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can still salvage the day! I crack open a
>
>beer. It is warm. I don't care.
>
>7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am hungry. I go inside the store. I walk

>past the beer frig. I notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I wonder if
>
>it's any good. I pull a Zima from the frig. I twist the top off and drink

>the Zima in three swallows. Zima sucks. I replace the empty bottle in the
>
>frig.
>
>7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the store. I walk to where the ingredients
>
>are, where the person usually makes the sub. There is no one there. I lean
>
>over the counter and scoop out half a bucket of black olives. I eat them.
>
>I am still hungry. I lean further over the counter and grab approximately
>
>two pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the store grunting and eating
>
>Pastrami. The patrons in the store fear me. I don't care.
>
>8:01 We are in South Austin. I have been drinking warm beer and singing
>
>Brooks and Dunn tunes for over an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
>
>singing. He suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn have written other good
>
>songs besides "You're Going to Miss Me When I'm Gone"
>
>and "Neon Moon" and that maybe listening to only those two songs, ten times
>
>each was a bit excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I could just let the CD

>play on its own. I tell him to fuck off and restart "Neon Moon."

>8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My truckmate, against my loud and

>profane protestations, parks on the top floor of a nearby parking garage. I
>
>tell him he's an idiot. I tell him we will never get out. I tell him we
>
>may as well pitch a fucking tent here. He ignores me.
>
>I think he's still pissed about the Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
>
>Moon" loudly.
>
>8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers stuffed in my pants. We're going
>
>to kick the shit out of Arizona.
>
>9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona 29. I am pleased. I go to the
>
>bathroom to pee for the 67th time today. I giggle to myself because of the
>
>new opportunity to do "the bathroom Brice." There are no Arizona fans in
>
>the bathroom. I am disappointed. I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
>
>"Niiiiiice cock." No one is amused but me.
>
>9:41 I walk to the bathroom while drinking Bud Light out of a can. Needless
>
>to say, they do not sell beer at the Erwin Center,much less Bud Light out
>of
>
>a can. I am stopped by an usher: "Where did you get that, sir?" I tell him
>
>(no shit): "Oh, the cheerleaders were throwing them up with those little

>plastic footballs. Would you mind throwing this away for me?" I take the
>
>last swig and hand it to him. He is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
>
>bathroom, but I run away giggling instead. I duck into some entrance to
>
>avoid the usher, who is now pursuing me. I sneak into a large group of
>
>people and sit down. The usher walks by harmlessly. I am giggling like a
>
>little girl. I crack open another can of Bud Light.
>
>9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid the usher, I have lost my bearings. I
>
>have no ticket stub. I cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
>
>10:09 Texas is being screwed by the refs. I am enraged. I have cleared out
>
>the seats around me because I keep removing my hat and beating the

>shouldn't take it so seriously. I tell him to fuck off.
>
>10:15 After the fourth consecutive "worst fucking call I have EVER seen," I

>
>However, on this occasion I miscalculate and I thumbnail myself in my left

>
>10:22 I am standing in the bathroom peeing. I'm so drunk I am swaying and

>

Diane,

Heartland Energy Group, Inc.
We essentially terminated VU4418.1 and VZ4240.1 on 9/24/01 and paid them $69,200 on 9/26/01 which is in VZ4240.3

Twister Gas Services, LLC
This is more complicated.  We terminated VL2515.1 and Y05186.2 totally.  We partially terminated VN4969.1 (Oct-01 & Nov-01 only), VU4647.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only), and Y05186.1 (Oct-01 thru Dec-01 only).  They were terminated on 9/24/01 and they were paid $116,700 on 9/26/01 which is in Y05186.7

I sent a fax to 713-646-2495 of the Termination Agreement they have for a prior deal.  They want one similar to this for these two deals.  Please call if you have any questions.  I appreciate your help.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Since Todd was the only one of you guys to use the reply to all, and thus
try to make my job easier, we will go with his choice of where to eat,
which is Beck's Prime.  Todd makes a good point that it tends to get
crowded around noon, so let's meet at 11:45 so that we may get a table.  If
I'm not there go ahead without me. I've got a meeting that may last til
noon.  I'll catch up with you after that.  Also, Giron will be in lovely
Oklahoma (no doubt some punishment for his role in the $1.0BN in write-offs
they took) and won't be joining us.

See you tomorrow.

Schroeder

Bryant said you spent the afternoon cussing at your machine, so I'm guessing it didn't work.  Thanks for trying!

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

Very interesting.  I'd saw where it was settled, but only a small statement.

If you think that is interesting, then check this one out :

If Santa answered his mail honestly... 
Dear Santa, 
I wud like a kool toy space  ranjur fer Xmas. Iv ben a gud boy all 
yeer yer  Frend, 
BiLLy 
Dear Billy, 
Nice spelling. You're on  your way to a great career in lawn care. 
How about I  send you a frickin book so you can learn to read and 
write? 
I'm giving your older brother the space  ranger. At least HE can 
spell! 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I have been a good girl all  year, and the only thing I ask for is 
peace and joy in  the world for everybody! 
Love, Sarah 
Dear Sarah, 
Your parents were smoking  pot when they had you, didn't they? 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I don't know if you can do  this, but for Christmas, I'd like for 
my mommy and daddy  to get back together. Please see what you 
can do?  
Love Teddy 
Dear Teddy, 
Look, your dad's banging the  babysitter like a screen door in a 
hurricane. Do you  think he's gonna give that up to come back to 
your  frigid mom, who rides his ass constantly? It's time to give 
up that dream. Let me get you some nice Legos instead. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I want a new bike, a  Playstation, a train, some G.I. Joes, a dog, 
a drum kit,  a pony and a tuba. 
Love, Francis 
Dear Francis, 
Who names their kid  "Francis" nowadays? I bet you're gay.  Only 
gay  people want tubas.  I'll set you up with a nice Barbie. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I left milk and cookies for  you under the tree, and I left 
carrots for your reindeer  outside the back door. 
Love, Susan 
Dear Susan, 
Milk gives me the runs and  carrots make the deer fart in my face 
when riding in the  sleigh.  You want to do me a favor?  Leave me 
a bottle of scotch. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
What do you do the other 364  days of the year? Are you busy 
making toys?  
Your friend, 
Thomas 
Dear Thomas, 
All the toys are made in  China. I have a condo in Vegas, where I 
spend most of my  time making low-budget porno films.  These 
producers seem to like fat studs. I unwind by drinking myself  
silly and squeezing the asses of all the cocktail  waitresses 
while losing money at the craps table.  
Hey, you wanted to know. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
Do you see us when we're  sleeping, do you really know when 
we're awake, like in  the song? 
Love, Jessica 
Dear Jessica, 
Are you really that  gullible?  I'll bet you're blonde.  Good luck 
in whatever you do.  I'm skipping your house. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dear Santa, 
I really really want a puppy  this year. Please please please 
PLEASE PLEASE could I  have one? 
Timmy 
Timmy, 
That whiney, begging shit may  work with your folks, but that 
crap doesn't work with  me. You're getting a sweater again. 
Santa 
---------- 
Dearest Santa, 
We don't have a chimney  in our house, how do you get into our 
home?  
Love, Marky 
Mark, 
First, stop calling yourself  "Marky", it sounds gay. That's why 
you're getting your  ass whipped at school.  Second, you don't 
live in a  house, you live in a low-rent apartment complex. 
Third,  I get inside your pad just like your mother's boyfriend 
does, thru the bedroom window. 
Sweet  Dreams, 
Santa
