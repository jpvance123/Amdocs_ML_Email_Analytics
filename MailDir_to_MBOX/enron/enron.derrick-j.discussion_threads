 The very first time that I laid eyes on  Steve Susman , he was clad only in 
his underwear.  Moreover, he was  shouting  and angrily brandishing his fist 
at me!  The Northern Lights may have seen stranger sights, but I assure you I 
have not.

 In 1968 or 1969 (you will understand that I have repressed the actual date), 
I journeyed to Fort Worth, Texas as a representative of the Texas Law Review 
to attend some State Bar of Texas committee meeting, one being held, I think, 
in conjunction with an annual meeting of the Bar.  The Law Review had 
reserved a few rooms at one of the downtown hotels.  I arrived late at 
night,  dutifully registered at the hotel's desk, received my room  key,  
took the elevator to the designated floor, walked to my room, inserted the 
room key, and opened the door.  The darkness that shrouded the room was 
suddenly pierced by a flare of light that revealed to my astonished eyes a 
bear of a man, almost naked, leaping out of the bed toward me, shaking a very 
large fist in the vicinity of my face, and demanding to know why I had 
violated the sanctity of his room!  

 It will surprise none who know Steve to learn that although he was  
adamantly insisting  on an explanation, he refused to be quiet long enough 
for me to offer him one.  Knowing even at my then tender young age a madman 
when I see one, I exited  the scene of the controversy with as much speed as 
my terrified legs could muster and rushed back to the front desk with my tale 
of adventure and close escape from severe bodily injury.  There may well have 
been some talk of calling hotel security or the Fort Worth Police, but in the 
end I settled for a new room, the door of which I bolted immediately. 

 After a mostly sleepless night during which I anticipated the imminent 
reappearance of the madman, I arose, showered,  dressed, and carefully made 
my way to the meeting room.  During the course of the day, I spotted the 
madman across the ballroom engaged in conversation with another individual.  
Surreptitiously pointing him out to one of my friends, I asked if he knew 
him.  The answer was no, but he did know who he was.  "The name is Susman, my 
man, Steve Susman".  I immediately resolved that my path and that of  
"Susman, my man, Steve Susman" would never again cross.  

 Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  How could I have possibly foreseen 
as I fled from the madman in  that Forth Worth hotel room so many years ago 
that not only would my path again cross his but that I would one day serve as 
his lawyer, that  he  would serve as mine,  and that I would count him  as 
one of my closest friends!  I hereby officially  forgive you, Steve, not only 
for stealing my  Fort Worth hotel room but also  for the injury you wished on 
me that night.  Looking back on it, I wouldn't want it to have been  any 
other way.

 I wish you the Happiest of Birthdays, Steve.  Thanks for your friendship--I 
treasure it. 

 All the best, 

 Jim

??? As I think I said when this came up  earlier, you can give to the general 
fund but alternatively can give to the  scholarship fund set up by Lee in 
honor/memory of his father:? Thomas  Godfrey Endowed Presidential 
Scholarship.? It all counts the  same.
?
If you  will commit to give $1000 for each of the next five years, you will 
be named a  Keeton Fellow.? That gets you a rubber chicken dinner once a 
year.?  Many of our UT grads are Keeton Fellows and it would be a nice thing 
to do when  our client Derrick and our ex-colleague Powers are in charge of  
fundraising.

Jim:
Here are our comments on the i2 Technologies insurance policy.  This is a
combination of my comments and Marcia Backus' comments, and in fact Marcia
gets the vast bulk of the credit (I found out that she has considerable
experience in this area).
(1)  This is a claims made policy.  Apparently they are all this way.
Ken should get a contractual commitment from the Company to renew the
coverage upon its expiration or obtain new coverage that covers claims made
after expiration of the policy but relating to periods when Ken served on
the board.
(2)  We didn't attempt to determine whether the amounts of coverage are
adequate in light of the company's business or whether the carriers are
solid; I suspect Jim Bouillion has far more expertise on those issues than
we do.
(3) See item E on page 23 of 26.  It appears that the effect of the
language is that the $150,000 deductible applies if there's any case where
the Company is required or permitted by law to indemnify Ken but for some
reason (other than insolvency) it does not indemnify Ken.  This appears to
be a provision designed by the insurance company to ensure that the Company
doesn't say to Ken "Hey, you'll be fine and we'll come out ahead if you
agree that we won't indemnify you; you can just collect from the insurance
company with no deductible, and we'll be better off because if we indemnify
you we'll have a deductible."  This provision may make sense from an
insurance policy standpoint, but Ken ought to make sure he has a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(4)  Please note exclusion 19 on page 22 of 26.  This provision is
designed to protect the insurance company by preventing the company from
making money by suing a director and then letting the director collect from
the insurance company.  Again, this points up that Ken needs a contractual
commitment from the Company to indemnify him to the fullest extent permitted
by law.
(5)  The application for the policy is part of the policy, which
apparently means that if there was something wrong with the application the
policy itself may be void, not only against the Company that applied for the
policy but also against innocent insureds such as Ken.
(6) The policy confers on the parent company the authority to cancel the
policy on behalf of the beneficiaries at any time.  Ken should get a
contractual commitment from the Company not to cancel the policy without
obtaining substitute coverage that is at least as good.
(7)   The policy provides insurance for employees as well as officers and
directors, which dilutes the coverage somewhat.
Generally, this appears to us to be an ok policy.  I would be very
interested in knowing whether Jim Bouillion disagrees with that assessment.

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

fyi--clearly, this was the "right thing to do."  But keep in mind that 
Transredes does not have a great credit rating.

Guys:

Just wanted to let you know that the Transredes board approved today to 
indemnify Enron for any legal expenses incurred in connection with the suit 
filed in Texas by Garner in exchange for a taking an active role in managing 
the litigation. The vote was 6 against one.

Fernando will be working together with Eileen and the gas pipeline guys in 
drafting the final agreement.

I guess this is good news for all the parties involved in this case.

Regards,

Miguel

Marc:  In connection with a dispute regarding a commercial arrangement 
between NewPower and Campus Dimensions, Inc. (also known as College Credit 
Card Corporation), Campus Dimensions, Inc. ("CDI") has engaged the law firm 
Klett Rooney Lieber & Schorling - headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA - to 
represent them against NewPower.  Klett Rooney has conducted themselves in a 
fashion that I would consider to be particularly unreasonable.  I would like 
to know if Enron has a relationship with Klett Rooney or CDI. If they do, I 
would recommend that the firm be removed from further engagements. Thanks.

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication;  Attorney Work 
Product

We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas 
supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron 
(Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.  
Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use 
the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.  
The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract 
would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for 
the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit 
bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not 
soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of 
supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable 
of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and 
have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We 
anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of 
interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement 
nonetheless. 

Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you 
approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.   

Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions.

Thank you.

Jim and Carrin,

I am waiting on the Hyatt to see what dates they have available.  Given
your availability, and that of Steve Susman and Glen Rosenbaum, we are
looking at either Tuesday, April 24 or Thursday, May 31.

I will keep in touch.

You have been  added to the CORPGEN mailing list  (Committee of Corporate
General Counsel  of the Business  Law Section) by BLS  List Administrator
<bllserve@ABANET.ORG>.

Please save this message for future  reference, especially if this is the
first time you are subscribing to an electronic mailing list. If you ever
need to leave  the list, you will find the  necessary instructions below.
Perhaps  more importantly,  saving a  copy of  this message  (and of  all
future subscription notices  from other mailing lists) in  a special mail
folder will give you instant access to the list of mailing lists that you
are subscribed  to. This may  prove very useful the  next time you  go on
vacation and  need to leave  the lists temporarily so  as not to  fill up
your  mailbox while  you  are away!  You should  also  save the  "welcome
messages" from the  list owners that you will  occasionally receive after
subscribing to a new list.

To send  a message to  all the people  currently subscribed to  the list,
just send mail  to CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. This is  called "sending mail
to the  list," because  you send  mail to a  single address  and LISTSERV
makes  copies  for all  the  people  who  have subscribed.  This  address
(CORPGEN@MAIL.ABANET.ORG)  is also  called the  "list address."  You must
never try to send any command to that address, as it would be distributed
to all the people  who have subscribed. All commands must  be sent to the
"LISTSERV  address," LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.  It is  very important  to
understand  the difference  between the  two, but  fortunately it  is not
complicated. The LISTSERV address is like  a FAX number that connects you
to  a machine,  whereas the  list  address is  like a  normal voice  line
connecting you to a person. If you make a mistake and dial the FAX number
when you wanted to talk to someone on the phone, you will quickly realize
that you  used the wrong  number and call again.  No harm will  have been
done. If on the other hand  you accidentally make your FAX call someone's
voice  line,  the  person  receiving the  call  will  be  inconvenienced,
especially if your FAX then re-dials  every 5 minutes. The fact that most
people will eventually connect the FAX machine to the voice line to allow
the FAX  to go through  and make  the calls stop  does not mean  that you
should continue to send FAXes to  the voice number. People would just get
mad at you.  It works pretty much  the same way with  mailing lists, with
the difference  that you are calling  hundreds or thousands of  people at
the same  time, and consequently  you can expect a  lot of people  to get
upset if you consistently send commands to the list address.

You may leave the list at any time by sending a "SIGNOFF CORPGEN" command
to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can also tell LISTSERV how  you want it
to confirm the  receipt of messages you  send to the list. If  you do not
trust the  system, send a "SET  CORPGEN REPRO" command and  LISTSERV will
send  you a  copy of  your own  messages, so  that you  can see  that the
message was distributed and did not get damaged on the way. After a while
you  may find  that this  is getting  annoying, especially  if your  mail
program does not  tell you that the  message is from you  when it informs
you that new  mail has arrived from  CORPGEN. If you send  a "SET CORPGEN
ACK  NOREPRO" command,  LISTSERV will  mail you  a short  acknowledgement
instead, which will  look different in your mailbox  directory. With most
mail programs you  will know immediately that this  is an acknowledgement
you can read later. Finally, you can turn off acknowledgements completely
with "SET CORPGEN NOACK NOREPRO".

Following  instructions from  the list  owner, your  subscription options
have been  set to "REPRO"  rather than  the usual LISTSERV  defaults. For
more  information  about subscription  options,  send  a "QUERY  CORPGEN"
command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.

Contributions sent to this list are automatically archived. You can get a
list of the available archive files by sending an "INDEX CORPGEN" command
to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG. You  can then order these files  with a "GET
CORPGEN LOGxxxx" command, or using LISTSERV's database search facilities.
Send an "INFO DATABASE" command for more information on the latter.

This  list is  available  in digest  form.  If you  wish  to receive  the
digested  version  of the  postings,  just  issue  a SET  CORPGEN  DIGEST
command.

Please note that  it is presently possible for other  people to determine
that  you are  signed up  to the  list through  the use  of the  "REVIEW"
command,  which  returns   the  e-mail  address  and  name   of  all  the
subscribers. If  you do not  want your name to  be visible, just  issue a
"SET CORPGEN CONCEAL" command.

More  information on  LISTSERV  commands  can be  found  in the  LISTSERV
reference  card, which  you can  retrieve  by sending  an "INFO  REFCARD"
command to LISTSERV@MAIL.ABANET.ORG.

Ray, Joe Dilg has informed me of your very kind offer of assistance with 
regard to my son's (James V. Derrick III) interest in applying to  the SMU 
School of  Law; I am most grateful. SMU is his first choice.   We are 
currently working on his application and hope to get it to the school within 
the next ten days.  He  graduated from the University of Mississippi and is 
currently enrolled in a university in Madrid, Spain studying Spanish. I will 
send you a copy of his application as soon as it is completed.  All the 
best.  Jim

FYI.  Although clearly slanted, the following is rather astute local coverage 
of the issue.

Asia Intelligence Wire


MUMBAI, DEC. 5. Strange as it may sound, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) would be paying less for the energy it buys from the 
Enron-sponsored Dabhol Power Company if it buys more. If it buys only half of 
the present capacity, the state- owned power utility would pay, as it 
does now, around Rs. 95 crores per month towards unbought power. That is its 
entrapment signed and sealed with Enron. 

Under the contract between the MSEB and the Dabhol- based independent power 
producer, the pricing of its output has two components: capacity 
charges and the variable or fuel charge. If it buys power, it pays a 
combination of the two and if it does not, MSEB has to fork out the capacity 
charges 
which is almost a penalty for not picking up the energy.


At present, MSEB is allowed to buy only 3,044 million units which is about 
half the Dabhol plant's capacity during its currently operating Phase I 
because 
the Electricity Regulatory Commission has stipulated that only cheaply 
sourced power should be on its shopping list and if it has to draw from 
Dabhol, then 
the ceiling is 3,044 million units. 

That means, when the MSEB pays for half the power that would be available, it 
is also paying some Rs. 95 crores towards the capacity charges and which is 
loaded on what has been bought. This arithmetic has pushed the price, in 
addition to the weakened rupee against the US dollar plus the $30 per barrel 
of oil in 
the international market, to hover at close to Rs. 7 per unit. 

Arguably, it would have been cheaper to buy the entire output from the 
present Phase I capacity of 740 mw but the problem is that MSEB does not have 
money 
to pay for that. Therefore it would like to evaluate its options, as advised 
by the Maharashtra Government, so that the right ways and means could be 
found to 
handle this issue. 

One is to appeal to the MERC to allow all the power to be bought as it is 
produced, since the IPP is all set to activate a part of its Phase II 
capacity which is pegged 
at 1,444 MW and then get energy at a lower average price. That means it can 
avoid paying the capacity charges it can ill-afford. Says an official : "it 
is throwing 
good money behind the bad." 

Let us look at the prices paid hitherto, when the US currency had a different 
parity with the rupee. When it was Rs. 43.02 to a dollar, the MSEB was billed 
at Rs. 3.37 
per unit in May 1999. Then it was tossed upwards, to reach Rs. 6.81 now and 
next month, move to about Rs. 6.90 per unit. "If the rupee slides further, we 
pay more," 
an official explained. 

There is a nice little twist to the Enron story. If the Power Purchase 
Agreement, as re-negotiated by the Shiv Sena - BJP Government had not made 
the 1,444 mw 
Phase II mandatory as against only an option to either pick up or reject in 
the earlier PPA, this need a re-look at the Phase II or the entire project 
may not have arisen. 

Those in the know of the economics of the situation explain :"If it was an 
option, we could have taken a hard look at the experience with the Phase I 
and decided on 
our steps. But the millstone was tied around the MSEB neck in 1996 itself by 
the previous Government. There seems to be no escape route except to ask the 
IPP to 
lower its prices by managing its cost of funds." That is now being done. Some 
FIs like IDBI have offered to lower its interest rate provided the lowered 
burden is
 transferred to the MSEB in the tariff. This is yet to become a widespread 
offer from FIs but the MSEB may, with the Maharashtra Government's help, 
quietly lobby 
towards that objective. That would not mean a lot but in the payouts, a few 
paise per unit less. 

When the first block of Phase II is activated by June 2001, at present 
dollar-rupee parity, with the price of petroleum products being the same, the 
price of power 
from Dabhol is estimated at about Rs. 5.43 per unit but that too to a 
financially crippled power board is stiff. But it can do little because of 
the "take or pay" deal 
with Enron. 

If the petroleum prices remain steady and the rupee does not slide, and when 
the second block of Phase II is operational, the price of power could dip but 
"we 
are talking of a situation which we can guess at." This is on the basis that 
MSEB can buy all the power and not merely end up paying capacity charges for 
not 
buying energy. 

According to present estimates, outgo towards power bought and not bought, 
would be Rs. 511 crores per month June 2001 onward, Rs. 712 crores per month 
October 2001 onward when the current realisation for the MSEB is only Rs. 920 
crores per month from all power sold from all sources it accesses, its own 
and 
others. That is unlikely to go up substantially, not in the near future.

I just returned to town and picked up your message re Enron General
Counsel's son and SMU. I am going to Washington early in the morning,
returning Wednesday evening.

I would be delighted to send a letter of recommendation to SMU Law School.
As a member of the School's Board of Visitors, I have had some success with
admissions, and would be happy try to help here. If he will send me a copy
of his college summary, I will prepare a letter and send it this week.

Hopefully, it will help. As you know, SMU is a long-time client, and Kay and
I, as well as the Firm, are significant money contributors to the School.

You asked about suggestions for agenda items for this meeting.  Here are a 
couple of thoughts:

     1.  The to-be-issued rewritten policies on FCPA, Antiboycott Laws, and 
U.S. Trade Restraint Laws (you'll have the latter two soon);

     2.  Standardized clauses for arbitration, choice of law, forum selection 

     3.  Attorney-Client Privilege Legend on Enron Lawyers' Email

     4.  OneEnron Policy on retention of email (Richard Sanders and I are 
working on this with IT--its in Richard's court right now)

     5.  Hiring between business units' legal departments (lawyers, 
assistants, and legal specialists)

     6.  Standardization of PRC and compensation between business units' 
legal departments.

=DJ Enron, Powerex Investigated For Alberta Price Fixing
11/21/0 15:31 (New York)



      By Cheryl Devoe Kim
      Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

  TORONTO (Dow Jones)--Canada's Competition Bureau raided the offices of Enron
Canada Corp. in Calgary and Powerex Corp. in Vancouver earlier this year as
part of an investigation into suspected electricity price fixing by the two
companies, according to documents obtained by Dow Jones Newswires.
  Bureau investigator David Bloom alleges in an application for a warrant he
used to gain access to the offices that in the summer of 1999, Powerex and
Enron were coordinating bid restatements and inflating the price each received
for electricity as they traded on the Power Pool of Alberta.
  The investigation hasn't yet produced any charges against either of the
companies, according to Enron. The Competition Bureau declined to comment on
the status of the case.
  Both Enron Corp. (ENE), which owns Enron Canada, and Powerex, a unit of
provincially owned British Columbia Hydro & Power Authority (X.BCH), deny
breaking any rules or laws.
  From Powerex's point of view, Albertans are looking for someone to blame for
high power prices, which have become a political issue in the province.
  "They just find it easy to blame us for what are pretty fundamental market
design flaws," Powerex president and chief executive Ken Peterson told Dow
Jones Newswires in an interview.
   Deregulation Spurs Search For Someone To Blame
  The search for someone to blame has repeated itself across every 
deregulating
market Enron has participated in, Enron Corp. spokesman Mark Palmer said.
  "Almost every time that either power markets or natural gas markets or even
oil markets or gasoline markets have experienced any kind of price volatility,
there have been investigations done," Palmer said.
  Enron has been scrutinized before as part of wider energy markets
investigations, he said, but never found to be breaking the rules. This is the
first such investigation into Powerex's actions, Peterson said.
  The Competition Bureau, based in Ottawa, won't say whether the investigaion
is ongoing, citing disclosure rules under the Competition Act.
  The companies themselves said they're not sure of the investigation's 
status.
Their seized files were returned several months ago, but Powerex hasn't heard
from the Bureau since then. Enron did receive a call from the Bureau last week
with a question, according to Enron Corp. spokesman Eric Thode.
  The investigation began when the Power Pool of Alberta's system controllers
noticed the clearing price for a megawatt of electricity was topping C$100 
with
unusual frequency.
  The Pool's price is set by participants submitting bids to buy or sell power
for the following day. Until Oct. 19, 1999, a bidder could restate the amount
of power in a bid or offer an unlimited number of times, until 20 minutes
before the hour of transmission. The price paid for every megawatt of power
needed by the Pool in a given hour is set by the most expensive unit needed to
meet demand.
   Alleged Bid Rigging Methods Detailed
  According to the Competition Bureau search warrant application, Powerex and
Enron were rigging their bids in the following manner:
  Powerex would lower the volume of an existing offer. As little as two 
minutes
later, Enron would increase its offer for the same period by the same volume,
but at a "significantly higher price," according to the warrant application.
Sometimes, Enron would increase its offer even before Powerex had dropped its
offer.
  Power Pool market analyst Owen Craig, who once worked in Enron Canada's gas
trading group, found that "as a result of restatements, involving mostly
Powerex and Enron," the Pool price was raised once to C$200/MWh, four times to
between C$354.29 and C$499.93, three times to between C$500 and C$541.63, and
10 times to between C$801.02 and C$998.
  Based on the restatement patterns, Craig, and then the Bureau's Bloom,
concluded that no new energy was being offered to the Pool. They believed the
power was just being transferred from Powerex to Enron and then offered at the
higher price, according to the warrant application. By cutting the volume
offered by Powerex, the more expensive power offered by Enron would likely be
needed, and every participant would get the higher price.
  Powerex's Peterson doesn't take issue with the trade history as detailed by
the Bureau, but denies that the company's traders were doing anything wrong or
that the two companies had some sort of arrangement.
  "And we're adamant about that," Peterson said. "There was no deal with 
Enron.
There was no expectation about what their behavior would lead to in terms of a
change in prices or anything like that."
  Powerex traders were merely locking in their price, cutting the company's
risk, which Enron agreed to take on by buying the power at a fixed price,
Peterson said.
  "Whenever Enron's offer of high-priced energy was declined, within moments 
of
Enron being advised by the Pool that their energy would not be required,
Powerex would restate an identical volume of energy back into its lower priced
unit," according to the warrant application.
  Peterson's response: "We're operating in a very tight market there and we
felt an obligation to make sure the power got delivered into Alberta."
  Enron also denies it broke any Power Pool rules or Canadian laws.
  "It boils down to we were offered power at a price lower than we thought we
could sell it at," Enron's Thode said. "And that's what Enron and every other
company does that's in the business of trading."
  The May 25 search warrant covers the companies' actions between June 1, 
1999,
and Oct. 19, 1999. On Oct. 20, 1999, the Pool changed its restatement rules,
essentially closing the loophole, though it did so without ever making public
its investigation into Powerex and Enron.
  Power Pool spokesman Wayne St. Amour declined to discuss details of the
investigation.
  "Market surveillance is in place to, among other things, protect the
interests and activities of market participants," he said.
  Those convicted under Canadian law for bid-rigging can be fined an amount at
the court's discretion and/or jailed up to five years. A conviction wouldn't
likely affect Powerex's ability to trade in the U.S., Peterson said. In Canada
"there would have to have some follow-on action by the Alberta parties to
inhibit that. And so far, they still like to get our power."
  Companies Concerned About Reputations
  The bigger problem, Peterson said, is what the case will do to the Powerex
reputation.
  "Essentially both companies are concerned about it because we have a lot at
stake from a reputational point of view," Peterson said. "Both companies, I
believe, conduct themselves in the highest possible standard. But these are
difficult times in the business with prices going crazy in Alberta and
California and people looking for somebody to blame. There's always a
possibility of collateral damage when politics gets involved."
  Powerex parent company BC Hydro is also suspected by the Power Pool of
Alberta of unfairly providing access to transmission through British Columbia,
linking Washington with Alberta, as detailed in an Oct. 13 Power Pool market
surveillance report. Again, no charges have been laid.

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

Subject: Topics for General Counsel Off-site

Jim, the following is in response to your request that we forward to you our 
suggested topics for the General Counsel offsite on April 4&5. 
 1. Outside Counsel
      - Who are the top firms we are using?
      -Should there be a data base for firms we are using(and particular 
attorneys in the firm)and for what.
      -Could/should the data base include info on fees paid to firms in the 
previous year so we know who the top firms are and also so we have an idea 
how much we pay in legal fees on an Enron wide basis.
     -What position do we take on probable fee increases toi cover the 
tremendous salary increases that firms recently gave to their associates?

 2.Legal Web Page
 Should we develop a Legal Group web page that has some of the info mentioned 
immediately above. We could also use this to pass on info re vacancies, 
announcements of new hires. This could also have a short bio on each attorney 
including in particular any particular expertise that the attorney may have 
so if someone has a question on swaps or Hart Scott or DOT regulations you 
could look inhouse first for answers to questions rather than picking up the 
phone and calling outside counsel for the answer to simple questions.

 3.Summer Clerks
 Should we have a centralized program for summer clerks?
 
 4. Recruiting
 Should we try to somewhat centralize this process or at a minimum set up a 
mechanism for letting the various groups know of good candidates that have 
been interviewed but not hired because of too many strong candidates for 1 
position.

 5. Management Succession
 I think we should develop a process for identifying/evaluating individuals 
who currently possess( or with some specific development could possess) the 
capability of moving into the "management " ranks of the legal function Enron 
wide. Thus when a vacancy does occur we have an idea of who are the persons 
who merit consideration from across the corporation to help ensure we are 
getting the best person for the job.

 6. One Enron- since the corporate theme is "one Enron" what can or should we 
be doing to make sure that happens.

Rebecca:

These meetings that were set up with Pawar in Delhi were supposed to be
attended by Wade but but he was unable to attend them due to the fact that
he fell sick. No agreements have been reached because there are none that
are contemplated. All we have done is to encourage the GOM to approach the
GOI for reducing their own liabilities. The details you will find in the
other memo I have already sent to you. (I picked up your email after I
finished sending my emails).  The approach as u will notice is no different
than what we have been following all along and I believe that  you know
that already.  If u want further clarification, I am happy to discuss this
with you or if u want to follow a different strategy then please let me
know. I am at the Delhi Oberoi at  91-11-4363030, room 716.

Ken had expressed to me last week that you desired to take charge
immediately and start moving the resolution of the Dabhol issues forward. I
agree that this will be the best way forward. Given the way things are
moving, I think that it would be best  that you arrive in Delhi immediately
over the weekend so that I can introduce you to the players on Monday and
start transitioning the relationships to you and Wade. Wade will join the
team in delhi as soon as he is able to travel. Tuesday onwards I have
urgent commitments in Mumbai that require my presence there.

As you can appreciate, your presence in these meetings will be essential
for you to start getting a feel for the situation on the ground and
developing the rapport with the key players. The GOM is clearly driving the
train and if we are to assist them its essential that we not slow them down
and assist them in any way we can.

regards,

Sanjay

Subject:  Meetings with Sharad Pawar

Sanjay,

Through several forwardings of memos it has come to my attention that you
had several meetings this week with Sharad Pawar and reached some
agreements.  I understand that a conference call to generate a strategy
regarding our approach to Mr Pawar was cancelled and no one is able to
explain to me what approach  you took or what the nature is of any
agreements or accomodations that you may have struck in these meetings.  I
think it is important that I and the rest of the task force be involved in
the setting of strategy even if we will call on you to conduct any of the
discussions and it is clear that it is cooperation and coordination is
paramount.

Please call or write immediately with a briefing of those meetings and of
any agreements that were agreed to.  In the future, I would appreciate
better coordination and discussions on all matter related to Dabhol and to
Metgas.  I am available by phone day or night.

Regards
Rebecca

Jim,

The proposed structure chart I sent you a few days ago has changed following 
some comments received from lawyers and commercial people. I attach the new 
version. The changes are in groups 1 to 3 which have been rearranged, both in 
terms of work allocation and people.



I am also proposing, as part of the same exercise, to make 5 new assistant 
general counsels:

Mark Elliott
Robert Quick
Martin Rosell
Sarah Gregory
Marcus Von Bock .

Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of this. 



      Mark

Lauren and Kelly:

I attach the consolidated legal comments to the  proposed Security and
Human Rights Principles, as well as  copies of your overview memo and of
the Principles themselves.

In summary, the note says we see no major issue legal that cause us to
advise Enron not to endorse the Principles, but that we do see a number of
significant matters that Enron should consider before it makes a decision
to endorse them.

There are two other items in addition to those mentioned in the note:

   In regards to e-mails we exchanged yesterday regarding the fact that
   these Principles are targeted at the extractive industry peer group that
   Enron tries to distinguish itself from and is largely exiting, I
   understand that Vicki will be contacting Kelly to discuss your
   suggestions  on differentiating Enron from those industries.
   It is not clear whether the decision to endorse the Principles must be
   made by the full Enron board or some level short of the Enron board.  I
   think Vicki will be discussing that with Rob.

Please call if you have any questions.

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

Board Members

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication;  Attorney Work 
Product

We may need to file a suit this week or next to enjoin the signing of a gas 
supply agreement between Petrobras and Compagas.  As you know, Enron 
(Dutapar), Copel, and Petrobras are the three shareholders of Compagas.  
Copel has as interest (along with El Paso) in the power plant which would use 
the gas.  A contract has already been signed between Compagas and the plant.  
The Compagas Board votes on the agreement tomorrow.  The gas supply contract 
would have a 20-year term and would be worth $1.2 billion.  The ground for 
the suit would be that, under Brazilian law, Compagas is required to solicit 
bids for the gas supply arrangement.   Compagas has sought to justify not 
soliciting bids on the basis that Petrobras is the only supplier capable of 
supplying the gas.  This is incorrect:  Enron, among others, is also capable 
of supplying the gas.  We have a legal opinion supporting our position. and 
have called for a special shareholders' meeting to discuss the issue.  We 
anticipate that Petrobras and Copel, despite their obvious conflict of 
interest, will force the issue and will vote in favor of the agreement 
nonetheless. 

Tozzini Freire has been advising us, and is doing an excellent job.  If you 
approve, we would like to continue to use them if litigation is necessary.   

Please call me or Randy with any comments or questions.

Thank you.

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of
finalizing
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many
observers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70
countries
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent

an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe

to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4
billion
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable
decision
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger

strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic

contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading

and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and
commercial
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron
Japan's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to
companies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing

to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely

may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

I attach for your review the final draft of the proposed Enron U.S. Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act Policy.  As I mentioned this morning, this draft is the 
result of many months of work by Mary Nell Browning, Bob Williams, Joe Dilg 
(Vinson and Elkins) and Martin Weinstein (Foley and Lardner).  I would like 
to roll this policy out early in the new year and so would appreciate 
receiving your comments as soon as possible but not later than the end of 
this year.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions or need any 
information.  Thanks.

Rob

Dear Fellow Traveler:=20

This month we are excited to highlight Travel + Leisure's favorite=20
TravelSmith products! Travel + Leisure editors picked TravelSmith=20
because the products "combine style and function, address a variety=20
of needs and circumstances, and are light, packable, and entirely=20
uncomplicated travel companions." Click here to see these=20
top products!=20

Women's Indispensable Travel Pants
These modern classics have the contemporary lines and smooth,=20
flattering fit you can depend on for an entire trip. In fact, they're=20
so versatile you may not need to pack another pair. They're as casual=20
or as dressy as you choose: Wear them with a blouse and blazer for an=20
elegant look, with a turtleneck and multipocketed vest for more=20
casual outings. And their substantial fabric - a blend of 63%=20
polyester, 33% rayon, and 4% Lyrcac for comfortable two-way stretch -=20
is as good looking and long wearing as wool, without wool's=20
fussiness; it defies wrinkles, even after days of packing and=20
wearing. Clean, no-waistband style has a side zipper and front darts=20
for a trim shape; a passport-size pocket behind the waist keeps cash,=20
credit card, or papers neatly concealed. $89=20

Overnight Essentials Bag
Compact, sophisticated, and ingeniously organized, this carry-on bag=20
keeps all your travel essentials close at hand - a reassuring feeling=20
in case your luggage is lost or delayed in transit. Open the smart,=20
handbag-like exterior to reveal multiple compartments: one with=20
compression straps that can hold a change of clothes, another with=20
elasticized shoe pockets. The two spill-proof plastic cases - ideal=20
for toiletries - are conveniently removable for trips to the=20
bathroom. Made of premium nylon twill, the Overnight Essentials Bag
can be carried by its leather-wrapped handles or a detachable padded=20
shoulder strap. 11" x 17 1/2" x 7". $99=20

Men's ComfortMax=01v Turtleneck
Polar bears know how to weather the winter: Each of their hairs is=20
hollow to trap air and provide a warm layer of insulation. Our=20
ComfortMax=01v Turtlenecks do the same thing for Homo sapiens. They're=20
made of a remarkable new jersey-knit fabric that blends 74%=20
high-performance ThermaStat=01v polyester with 26% natural cotton for=20
the ultimate in warmth and moisture control. ThermaStat=01v also traps=20
air in its hollow fibers, providing exceptional insulation with very=20
little weight (just 8 ounces per shirt). The fabric also wicks=20
moisture efficiently, which means you stay dry and comfortable when=20
you're walking or cycling. These shirts dry quickly - more than 50%=20
faster than 100% cotton. $32=20

Women's Featherweight Leather Jacket
Most leather jackets are best left in your closet at home - they're=20
just too heavy, bulky, and impractical for travel. Our Featherweight=20
Leather Jacket is exceptional on all counts: It's so lightweight and=20
supple that you can easily pack it, and so versatile you'll wear it=20
everywhere on your itinerary. We've used fine Italian calfskin and=20
eliminated the shoulder pads for a finished weight of just 26 ounces=20
of unencumbered luxury. Best of all, the leather is treated to repel=20
water and stains, so you can enjoy this jacket in any weather. The=20
classic walking length covers your hips and provides the perfect=20
proportion with pants or skirts. $399=20

Guaranteed 100% - No Questions - No Exceptions
We promise a full refund if you are not totally satisfied at any time=20
you own a TravelSmith product. Tested everywhere from the Amazon to=20
Zihuatenejo, TravelSmith products are designed to withstand the=20
rigors of the road. That's why we stand confidently and fully behind=20
everything we make.=20

Airplane Comfort Kit
The airlines' idea of comfort just doesn't measure up: Scratchy,=20
handkerchief-size, shared-with-strangers blankets and tiny, lumpy=20
pillows are a recipe for jet lag. Next time you fly, pack your own=20
Airplane Comfort Kit instead. The cloud-soft fleece pillow unzips to=20
reveal a generous (36" x 60") double-faced fleece blanket that=20
surrounds you (and only you!) with heavenly softness and lightweight=20
warmth. There's even a thoughtfully placed pocket at the bottom in=20
which to nestle your feet. The pillow can be inflated to precisely=20
your preferred level of firmness. Blanket and pillow cover can be=20
washed and dried by machine. Pillow also available separately. For=20
those desiring added lumbar support, the inflatable back pillow is a=20
great comfort add-on. $38=20

Men's Classic Packable Raincoat
These handsome raincoats have the superior quality and classic style=20
of those fashionable English macs. But they go one better by being=20
lightweight, packable, and 100% waterproof - ergo, a far better value=20
and the ideal raincoats for the road. (Most raincoats are not=20
actually rainproof!) Made of suede-soft microfiber, with a frankly=20
sensual texture, they weigh just 26 ounces. Best of all, each folds=20
into a compact travel pouch built into the lining. The travel pouch=20
slips easily into any carry-on. All styles are as impervious to=20
fashion trends as it is to rain and wind. Generous fit. $159=20

Medium Pack-It Envelope
These lightweight carriers are the answer to every frequent packer's=20
prayers. Not only do they organize your travel wardrobe by category=20
or function, Pack-It Envelopes prevent wrinkles by keeping clothing=20
from shifting around in transit. You'll even find you can pack more=20
in less space because the Pack-It compresses its load. Three colors=20
allow color-coded organization. Each Pack-It Envelope comes with a=20
folding board and instructions for quick and easy folding. The medium=20
size holds 8 to 12 dress shirts, blouses, or trousers. From Eagle=20
Creek. $25=20

Swiss Army Multi Tool
A screw falls out of your eyeglasses. A button pops off your pants.=20
The bike you rented needs a brake adjustment. From the people who=20
brought you Swiss Army knives, this Multi Tool corrects a multitude=20
of minor setbacks on the road and is compact enough to carry in your=20
pocket. In addition to the usual assortment of blades, you'll find a=20
wide range of screwdrivers, a bottle opener, can opener, corkscrew,=20
ballpoint pen, tweezers, pliers, hex wrenches, scissors, a sewing eye=20
- 34 different tools in all. Imported from Switzerland. 3 1/2" long=20
(closed). $75=20


NOTABLE NEWS=20

CHILDREN FLYING SOLO=20

The holidays are here -- the season many children equate with shiny=20
new toys, gingerbread cookies, steaming mugs of hot chocolate... and=20
airplane travel. Each year, millions of kids between the ages of=20
five and 12 fly unaccompanied on major airlines. If your children=20
or grandchildren will be flying unaccompanied this holiday season,=20
you'll want to be prepared and knowledgeable before they get on=20
the plane.=20

Below are a few tips from TravelSmith to help you make sure the=20
children in your life are safe and happy travelers this=20
holiday season.=20

? Try to book only nonstop or direct flights so that the child does=20
not need to change planes. Changing planes can be intimidating and=20
scary, especially in major airports.=20

? Where a minor must be assisted by airline personnel in order to=20
change planes, expect a fee of $20 - $50.=20

? Do not drop your child off at the curb! Parents or legal=20
guardians are responsible for bringing the minor directly to=20
the departure gate.=20

? Get to the airport early. Parents or legal guardians should allot=20
time to fill out all paperwork required for unaccompanied minors,=20
most importantly the paperwork that travels with the child.=20

? Because in-flight food service can be slow or delayed, it's a=20
good idea to pack some favorite snacks for the child to carry onto=20
the flight.=20

? Parents or legal guardians should provide the airline with written=20
information about how flight delays or cancellations should be=20
handled, including emergency contacts and a means to pay for=20
necessities, such as overnight accommodations.=20

? Upon arrival at the destination point, airline personnel are=20
required to escort the child off the plane. They are not allowed to=20
turn the child over to a waiting parent or guardian without seeing=20
the adult's identification and matching it with the information on=20
the form filled out before departure.=20

? An authorized parent or guardian must pick the child up at the=20
arrival gate. Not only is it important for the child's sense of=20
security to be met personally at the arrival gate, but in some cases,=20
children will be turned over to local child welfare authorities if no=20
parent or guardian is present to pick them up.=20

=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=

I'm having trouble accessing my email but here is the latest.  There are more 
newspaper articles which make me believe that GOM's position is hardening on 
reviewing the project.  I met with two of our outside lawyers today.  Atul 
recommended that we review the possibility of a challenge based on 
unconscionability or void as against public policy.  

The lawyers are universally pretty pessimistic regarding the possibility of a 
satisfactory outcome for Enron.

I'm meeting with the rest of our India lawyers tomorrow, including Robert 
Mathis.

Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.

Thank you for your quick response!

As I suspected, I was slow on the draw.  Justin Boyd with our London team has 
already directed a firm in India to start looking at these issues.

I'll forward your email to Justin, as he very well may want to coordinate 
some of this through Sandeep, if Sandeep has the capacity to help us out.  

Thanks again for your help.

work with you and outside counsel on this. Sandeep -- since this is a bit of 
a rush, I would like for either you or perhaps Lena to work directly with 
Travis and outside counsel and try to get some quick answers.

Subject: Clickpaper.com - Indian legal issues

Wade:

I hope things are going well for you.  It was good to see you the other day.  
I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are 
checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a 
little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a 
reference to someone that could assist us.

Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and 
lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after 
EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the 
process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the 
Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper 
enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern 
their use of and trading on the site.

Those access and trading agreements are "jurisdiction specific" -- customized 
for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based 
-- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with 
accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory 
issues, etc.   

The team has identified India as having a large number of potential 
customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and 
they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the 
very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to 
consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an 
apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due 
diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model 
and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.

Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist 
us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case 
here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.

To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several 
people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway, 
please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.  Thanks.

=09=09 Subject: Organizational Changes

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=

the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=

der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20

=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=
ralia=20
and Japan, and Enron Metals, remains unchanged under the leadership of John=
=20
Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=
=20
CEO, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer, will continue to have=20
responsibility for Enron=01,s Middle East and LNG operations.  With the=20
exception of Ecoelectrica in Puerto Rico, all operating power plants and=20
associated personnel in the Caribbean and Central America will transfer to=
=20
Enron Global Assets.  Enron Global Markets will also continue to manage the=
=20
commodity businesses in crude and products, coal, weather, insurance,=20
equities, interest rates, foreign exchange, and agricultural products.

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets=01, organization, under the leadership of Jeff McM=
ahon,=20
President & CEO, and Ray Bowen, Chief Operating Officer, remains unchanged.

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=
y,=20
the individual business units.  We are creating no incremental overhead in=
=20
the creation of EWS, and in fact hope to reduce our operating costs by more=
=20
efficient utilization and sharing of resources across EWS.

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=
=20
EWS in addition to their ongoing roles within their business units.  These=
=20
newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=
e=20
Operations across EWS.  These services will become part of Enron Net Works,=
=20
with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=
ed=20
services organization with IT and e-commerce platforms to support the=20
wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=
=20
services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=
=20
continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=
=20
for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20

                    PM                       Subject:     Dabhol Status





Jeff/Ken:

I heard from Wade that there were a number of questions on Dabhol yesterday
and I thought it may help if u received a quick update. Over the last 3
days, I have met with most key players in GOI and GOM assisted by some very
close friends of ours. The start of the state assembly session has given
some politicians and some vested interests an opportunity to raise issues
about Dabhol in the assembly again, a feature that we have seen every year,
at about this time, without exception and has led to a number of misleading
newspaper reports. The usual suspects are behind the latest stirring of the
pot.

The facts however are as follows:

1. GOM (at the administrative and political level) and MSEB remain firmly
behind the project and the commitments to it. They are concerned but at the
same time looking at proactively working to find a solution. They also
believe that they may have found one that is agreeable to GOI.

2. After discussions with us on Tuesday, GOM and MSEB are working on a plan
(thru this weekend) to treat Dabhol as a national asset. The plan involves
MSEB selling  power from DPC to the central government utility which will
then pool the power with over 30,000 MW of power that they currently
control and sell the power onward to other states. The plan has already
been discussed at senior levels in the GOI and finds general acceptance.
Obviously the details are to be worked out and we are proceeding to help
GOM put the outline together over this weekend in Delhi and GOM will then
discuss it with MOP on Monday.

Wade reported that it was felt that the seniormost GOI ministers be
apprised  of the seriousness which with we are viewing this situation. This
was already done Tuesday.

3. The Indian Lenders to the Dabhol project have met and agreed to a 30 day
waiver of MSEB delay in payment - agreed subject to review of the situation
at the end of 6 months. They have also agreed to the Equity transfer -
subject to lenders counsel confirming that there are no legal issues under
any of the project contracts. This shows the lender support for continuing
to move forward and buys us time to put in place the fix we are planning.

4. Ministry of Power has yesterday agreed to support an effort to freeze
the duties on imported fuel at a lower level of about $12/bbl versus the
current $35 or so. This will help achieve an immediate reduction in tariff
from Phase I and make Dabhol more competitive. This proposal is currently
with Ministry of Finance and our expectation is that they will review it
favorably as the MOP is taking it up personally.

All signs that I have received in India over the last few days lead me to
believe that the GOM is committed to solving the Dabhol issues at the
earliest. While we all have concerns, they seem to be addressable and if
the current plan is successful, they can  be sorted out within the context
of current and existing documentation.

I have left names out but they are better discussed on the call that has
been scheduled for Monday evening India time. Hope that this helps in the
meantime.

Regards,

Sanjay

Jim:  we need to hire counsel in Virginia to handle our license application 
with the PUC.  My experience in Washington was that the state was fairly 
parochial and did not generally look favorably to Virginia licensed attorneys 
from D.C. firms.  On that basis, I would like to engage a "Virginia" firm 
with good connections with the PUC.  I used to use McGuire Woods for Virginia 
litigation, but I don't know if they are on Enron's "approved" list, or if 
they have the expertise to handle a PUC application.  Do you have a 
recommendation?  Marc

yet.    There are several employees such as Bob Vote, Robert Eickenroht and 
Chuck Cheek who are classified as Asst General Counsel which is a Sr Director 
job group and not VP.  

I am in training all day on Friday, Nov 10th and from 3-5 on Monday Nov 
13th.  I have HR PRC meeting on November 14th but I will be trying to keep up 
with e-mails and voice mails at night if you have any questions.

Dear Directors and Auditors:

We would like to rearrange the next BOD meeting schedule.
As you know, the BOD decided to have the next BOD meeting on Feb. 8th, 2001=
.
However, we think it is difficult to have the next BOD meeting on that date
because of preparation of financial statement.
Please understand that subsidiaries' financial statement should be=20
consolidated
prior to SK-Enron's financial statement and this process is our main concer=
n.
Considering this situation, we suggest to have the next BOD Meeting at 2pm =
on
Feb. 20th, 2001. in Houston.
And meeting place in Houston will be notified you when it is determined.
If you are uncomfortable with this schedule,
please let us know so that we can arrange it again.

Sincerely yours,

K.R.Choi

Jim,

Attached you will find the press release announcing the opening of our
Houston office, effective from January 1, 2001.  This is an important step
for the Firm and, in particular, the continued development of our oil, gas
and power practice.  Once the office formally is opened, we will look
forward to inviting you and others from the legal group over to meet the

Hi James:

My name is Pat Brandt and I work for the Legal Research Center ("LRC") in
Minneapolis.  As you may know, we are the nation's leading provider of
outsourced legal research and writing services.  Recently, we have entered
into a strategic business alliance with Integrity Interactive Corporation
("IIC"), to offer industry-leading, online compliance training - training
that could help Enron save millions in the event of a DOJ prosecution.
LRC's role in this alliance is to provide the legal research content for the
compliance courses and assist in the marketing and selling of the IIC
product.

You can view our compliance modules at work or home, as long as you have
access to the internet and a personal access code.  To receive an access

Subject: RE: SAN ANTONIO MEETING


A few thoughts on topics that might be worthy of discussion at our meeting: -

1. Outside Counsel fees;
2. Recruitment and retention of lawyers and the impact of recent increases in 
salaries elsewhere;
3. Cross calibration of recruits and promotions within the legal department;
4. Communication between the various groups;
5. Are we facing an increased risk of investigation worldwide e.g. FCPA, 
other regualtory issues and are we doing enough to deal with these risks?
6. Technology - as the company becomes more and more e-commerce and 
technologically advanced, is the legal department keeping up e.g. should 
lawyers be more  computer literate, do we need to send them on courses etc?

These are just a few thoughts and please do not hesitate to contact me if you 
would like to discuss any of them or would like some additional ideas.

Thanks very much 
Michael

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Direct
Enron Direct was recently cited by Ofgem for high complaint levels with 
regard to account complaints per total customers served.  Enron Direct views 
the Ofgem customer service measures very seriously and is committed to 
improving all aspects of its customer service - even while enjoying continued 
strong growth in its retail commodity business.   However, the account 
complaint level measure is particularly biased against fast-growing new 
entrants like Enron Direct.  Since all of Enron Direct's customers have 
recently switched suppliers - which is when most complaints occur - and our 
total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs, our account complaint 
levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group.   In 
fact, Enron Direct's complaint levels for both transfers (i.e., switchers) 
and mis-selling, as measured by Ofgem, were well below industry averages.  
While we are not yet best-in-class, Enron Direct's portrayal as an industry 
laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading.  Stay tuned.

Relations with UPM-Kymmene
As previously announced, Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a two year 
energy portfolio management agreement with UPM-Kymmene, the forestry industry 
enterprise.  This deal creates huge potential for business opportunities 
across a wide range of areas for Enron.  

As part of the agreement, UPM-Kymmene has requested a dedicated account 
manager in Oslo.  In order to comply with this request, we have appointed 
Sami Tenngren on a full time basis to establish the operational framework and 
to coordinate all Enron relations with UPM-Kymmene regarding power related 
issues.

It is important that all Enron businesses take advantage of this unique 
opportunity to generate profitable business relations with UPM-Kymmene. If 
you would like to discuss new business opportunities related to worldwide 
power with UPM-Kymmene, please contact the Nordic Origination Team. Please 
also keep us informed about any other business development issues related to 
UPM-Kymmene within other parts of Enron.

Weekly EnronOnline Figures
Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of December 6, 2000

* Total Life to Date Transactions > 503,940
* Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions > $301 billion

Worth noting, EOL did $6.7 billion worth of US business on December 4, 2000!

Australia
The Sydney Metals Desk is now fully manned. Welcome to Owen Murphy,  Max 
Sobal and Robert Heynen to the Sydney Office.  The Metals Group is already 
reviewing the possibilities of utilising the existing metals customer base in 
Australia to expand these relationships to include power supply/pricing, a 
large component of overall costs.  While it is early days, our preliminary 
discussions on the idea of pricing for power in relation to metal price is 
receiving a positive response. 


ENRON IN THE PRESS

Virtual tanker swaps generate $5m freight in real terms
The inclusion of tanker swaps on Enron's online Internet trading platform in 
early October has already generated trade for 600,000 tonnes of tanker 
freight derivatives contracts worth the equivalent of $5m of freight in real 
terms - and all based on just one tanker route.

Volatility in the tanker physical sector prompted Enron to add tanker swaps 
to its new online platform.  Enron Director, Scott Moncrieff, told Lloyd's 
List: "The reason we started tanker forward freight agreements was because of 
the volatility.  We are experiencing the highest levels of volatility since 
the Gulf War."

Based on existing figures, the Enron team believes that growth in the 
physical market will fuel freight swaps demand.  Mr Moncrieff said: "The 
market for physical tanker freight will be over $10b in 2001.  This will 
obviously expose a lot of people to risk.  We want to give our customers as 
many options as possible so that it reflects their fleet."  Lloyds List

Enron lines up the big players
Enron is on line to introduce big players into the dry bulk freight 
derivatives market in the new year.

Enron's Pierre Aury, told Lloyd's List:  We are now meeting with banks and 
some have volunteered to trade on behalf of their shipping customers.  
Hopefully by early next year we should see the first trades with these new 
players."

After entering the shipping freight swaps market earlier this year, the 
EnronOnline initiative has generated plenty of business, and has, its 
creators hope, contributed towards liquidity in the other freight 
over-the-counter markets.

While Enron would like to see even more business come its way, surprise has 
been expressed at how quickly the online market has become established.

"We thought it would have taken longer to take off but we have reached close 
to 1.5m tonnes (dry bulk freight swaps) traded online.  Some days we are 
doing more than the over-the-counter markets.  Our dream target would be to 
double trade on the forward freight agreement market reasonably quickly," 
said Mr Aury. Lloyds List

Chance for competitive market.  Enron wants to trade with Polish energy.
"Experience from West European markets shows, that liberalisation leads to a 
decrease in energy prices for end-users, especially plants and companies.  
Competition and the TPA rule gives freedom of choice of contractor, and 
allows implementation of risk management tools.  It also allows potential 
investors to objectively evaluate analysed enterprises based on market 
research," said Jarek Astramowicz.  Parkeit (Polish national daily)

place on the 22nd April 2001.  Places will be given to those who pledge the 
most money and give a non-refundable cheque (minimum o500) as a deposit.  The 
money can then be given to a charity of your choice.  Those who wish to apply 
should email adrian.watts@enron.com with their choice of charity and the

GOT SOME LOOSE CHANGE?  TIME TO CLEAN OUT THOSE DESK DRAWERS. . .

You've all heard the reminders that we like to maintain a clean desk policy 
here at Enron House, but have we told you about the clean desk drawer policy, 
too?  Starting next week we plan to give everybody a fabulous opportunity to 
clean out their desk drawers and off load all those pesky pennies, francs, 
lira, escudos, pesetas, rupees, drachma, schillings, deutsch marks, dollars 
and any other foreign currency you have kicking around in your drawer into 
the two big blue bins in the Forum.  UNICEF and Enron have teamed up to give 
you a chance to make a fresh start in the New Year with a change-free 
drawer.  So, join in the fun and empty out those rattling desk drawers -- 
'cause we'll be calling a desk check come the end of January!  Oh, and yes, 
if you want to turn over a new leaf at home for the New Year, then gather up 
your loose change and drop it off in one of the bins on your way upstairs. 
The small print: All loose change will be collected by Travellex foreign 
currency exchange bureau for counting and, in the case of foreign currency, 
will be exchanged at market rates into pounds sterling.   The money will then 
be donated to UNICEF -- the United Nation's Childrens Fund -- to support, 
among other projects, their worldwide child care immunisation and clean water 
schemes.

Carrin & Jim --

It was an honor and a pleasure to meet both of you yesterday.  I know we will
have fun working together on this very special event.

Jeff left the jurisprudence luncheon lists for me before he left on vacation.
 I wasn't sure whether he transmitted them to you as well.  Would you please
advise me if you would like them sent to you?  I can email the MS Excel files
or I can fax the hard copies to you.   Please advise what is most convenient.

I plan to be in town through the holidays and can be reached by phone, email,
or cell phone at any time.  My cell phone number is 713/705-4829.

Thanks again for your interest in the ADL's work.  Martin.

Committee members,

The Fall Meeting of the Corporate General Counsel is past, and from all
appearances it was a success.  It was good to meet many of you that
attended.  I wanted to take this opportunity to give you an update on some
initiatives Mr. Morgan is looking to implement and how we're going about
implementing  them.

The Committee's web site (see
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/home.html), as Mr. Morgan announced,
will be going through some modifications to enhance its usage.  The first
item to report is that the web site will be secured, in that it can only be
accessed by its members.  You will be asked to login with your ABA id
number, and also provide a password which is your last name.  Access to the
site will only be for current ABA members, who belong to both the Section
and the Corporate General Counsel Committee.

The second item to report is the posting of past and upcoming meeting
agendas.  You'll be able to see what was discussed at previous meetings, as
well as what is upcoming by clicking on the links.  Also to be included on
the site will be the materials that were distributed at your meetings.  Some
of the materials from the Fall Meeting have been posted and can be viewed at
the following link by clicking here:
http://www.abanet.org/buslaw/corpgen/fallmeeting2000.html

The third development to report is the implementation of a member profile
page and a foreign outside counsel searchable database, which I discuss in
length below.

COMMITTEE MEMBER PROFILES

The page will have all committee members listed, and will require the
submission of a photograph and a resume as follows:

*       Photographs -  A black and white or color photo should be submitted.

FOREIGN OUTSIDE COUNSEL SEARCHABLE DATABASE

Mr. Morgan solicited comments from members at the Fall Meeting regarding the
implementation of an on-line searchable database, consisting of foreign
counsel that committee members have used.  The purpose would be to take the
guess work out of contacting foreign counsel should the need arise.  The
database would be on the committee's web site with a link, and would have
searchable criteria like country, firm, expertise, clients represented etc.
The idea was received well with members present who attended the Fall
Meeting.

The only caveat to this is that the project needs to be approved by the ABA
Board of Governors.  In discussions with the Policy Office of the ABA, there
is a concern that this might imply an "endorsement" of sorts, and I was
advised to have Mr. Morgan submit this idea for approval by the Board.  We
will be taking the necessary steps to get the approval, with the hope that
we can move forward to implement.  You will be updated about the status of
the approval.



Please let me know if I can answer any questions for you.

Subject: TECASO Project - Outside Counsel

Jim,

We are currently reviewing a new business opportunity with EES to enable 
EECC  to provide technical and commercial due diligence services for global 
infrastructure project financing.  If the new business opportunity receives 
approval from EES management, we see the need to retain outside counsel 
experienced in internet/web based issues.  Presently this need would be with 
the web, structuring, IP, and antitrust areas.

In an effort  to find a firm that Enron has used recently for web related 
matters, I spoke with Mark Taylor and Marianne Castano.  For Enron Online 
development, Mark used Sullivan and Cromwell and Milbank, Tweed for the 
web/trading effort and V & E for IP matters,  For a recent EES internet 
project Marianne used Vivian Polak of LeBeouf Lamb for web/transactional 
issues and V & E for IP matters.  She was very pleased with Vivian's 
support.  After discussing our specific requirements with Mark and Marianne 
and reviewing this matter with Vicki Sharp,  I spoke with Vivian briefly to 
confirm if she had the experience we needed.  I found she had exactly what we 
needed and subsequently discussed this with John Schwartzenburg.  John 
agreed. 

With your approval I would like permission to engage Vivian Polak of LeBeouf, 
Lamb for web, structuring and transactional related issues and Scott Brown of 
V & E for IP matters.  

If you should need any additional information concerning the TECASO Project 
or this request, please let me know.

Thank you,

Randy

Jim, in connection with your interest in identifying a top notch litigator
in California to look after Enron's interests in California, I would
recommend you consider David Balabian and Chris Hockett of the firm of
McCutchen Doyle Brown and Enerson LLP. McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with
its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and
Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial
litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP
litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some
power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who
I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that
Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David
Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the
leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a
relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I
assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional
information.  Joe

Rebecca/Jim -

The India legal team has completed two important reviews:

Permits/Approvals Review.  Sandeep Katwala led a group reviewing our permits 
and approvals.  They feel pretty good about our compliance with these 
permits/approvals.  As you have heard on previous phone calls, the day tank 
seepage some time ago makes us the most nervous.  It seems to us that a 
release from the site resulting in substantial groundwater contamination 
plays pretty well in the court of public opinion given DPC's failure to "come 
forward" on the issue (even though it was advised at the time of the release 
that it had no legal obligation to do so).  Sandeep's note is below.

PPA Review.  Paul Kraske led a group reviewing the PPA.  His memo on this 
issue is also below.  He feels pretty good about our ongoing compliance with 
the PPA.  The instances of the non-compliance are not particularly material 
and none would appear to play well in the court of public opinion.  I should 
also note that it would be very difficult for MSEB to lawfully terminate the 
PPA -- that remedy is not readily available to MSEB under the PPA terms.

Both review efforts have relied somewhat on the representations of DPC 
personnel.  The India legal team was able to "tie down" many significant 
issues with written documentation but in many cases have relied on the oral 
representations of our own employees to confirm compliance with our 
obligations.

There are a number of other legal review efforts underway and I will keep you 
apprised as these reviews progress.

Bruce,
Lauren, Narayan and Kunal have completed their review of DPC compliance with 
clearances. Based on discussions with DPC personnel and a review of 
correspondence where relevant, no material non-compliance issues have 
surfaced which I feel would pose a problem under the PPA. There are two 
instances under the Reserve Bank of India approvals DPC has failed to submit 
reports to the Ministry of Finance within the time frame indicated; these are 
however minor issues. We have to accept that there may be practical instances 
where there may not be strict compliance at the site (eg the actual 
construction of physical assets is not strictly as per the layout approved by 
the authorities) but, from the discussions with DPC personnel none of these 
have come to light. On the environment approvals DPC has submitted compliance 
statements to the Maharashtra State Pollution Control Board which confirm 
that DPC is in compliance with the conditions in the relevant approvals. We 
have relied on these statements as being accurate. 

With respect to the water pollution issue, as we saw on Saturday, DPC has 
notified MPCB pursuant to the show cause notice of the measures taken to 
mitigate the pollution off the site. That correspondence seemed to indicate 
that there should be no further problems with this issue. However, my sense 
is that we have not seen the end of this issue and in particular, the report 
currently being prepared by GSDA has not yet surfaced in final form. There is 
no guarantee that it will be positive. Shobhan's view that it is difficult to 
see how a Court would support an injunction of some sort shutting down the 
plant "permanently" given the remedial measures taken by DPC is persuasive - 
you can however see that it provides excellent ammunition for PR purposes.

Rumors of Eni / Enron Merger Abound, Despite Denials from Eni
By: Will McNamara, Director, Electric Industry Analysis
===============================================================

Eni, the Italian oil and gas group, is expected to complete the sale of
its Italian property interests next week as part of its strategy to focus
on its core activities of natural-gas and oil production. Vittorio Mincato,
Eni's chief executive, confirmed that the group is on the verge of
finalizing
the sale of its Immobiliare Metanopoli property subsidiary (Eni's real
estate company) with assets valued between $856 million and $1.3 billion.
Eni's decision to divest its property assets has been viewed by many
observers
of the company as an attempt to release funds to facilitate a merger with
another company. Enron Corp. has been among those on a rumored short list
of merger prospects for Eni.

ANALYSIS: Is the foundation being established for a mega-merger between
Eni and Enron? It is not too difficult to formulate a theoretical argument
in that direction.

Eni is Italy's state-owned, multi-faceted energy company, operating in
the oil and gas, power generation, petrochemicals, oilfield services, and
engineering industries. The company has a market capitalization of about
47 billion euros (approximately $40 billion), is present in over 70
countries
and produces more than one million barrels of oil equivalent a day. Across
the European energy market-which once it has fully privatized will represent

an arguably larger market than the United States-Eni is unquestionably
one of the Continent's leading champions.

Illustrating this point, Eni has taken several important steps within Europe

to, as it says, "play an increasingly important role" in the Continent's
competitive energy market. For instance, earlier this month, Eni inked
a deal to sell 2 billion cubic meters of natural gas to Gaz de France.
This deal followed a previous agreement in which Eni agreed to sell 4
billion
cubic meters of natural gas to Italy's largest private energy supplier,
Edison. With both agreements, Eni has given a substantial kick start to
the opening of the European natural-gas market. CEO Mincato has said that
Eni would recoup the losses made by giving up its market hold in Italy
by "focusing on international markets."

One move that Eni has made outside of Europe also came earlier this month.
Eni made a bid for Australia's Petroz NL, which wields an 8.25 percent
stake in Bayu-Undan, the giant gas and liquids project located off the
northern coast of Australia. Eni already owns 6.7 percent of Bayu-Undan
and apparently is attempting to gain a majority ownership over the project.
It is no wonder why-the Bayu-Undan field has recoverable reserves of 400
million barrels of liquefied petroleum gas and gas reserves of 3.4 trillion
cubic feet. Petroz has not yet accepted Eni's offer, but a favorable
decision
is expected shortly. Thus, whatever Eni may be divesting in Italy it is
trying to regain in other key areas of the world. In fact, Mincato recently
confirmed that Eni plans to increase its daily output of oil from a current
level of 1.2 million barrels to 1.5 million barrels by 2003.

Moreover, Eni has been making aggressive attempts at expansion, both within
Europe and beyond. Along with that expansion comes the development of merger

strategy. Eni does not want to be left as a target for a takeover, which
could be a strong possibility given its recent divestitures and the fact
that its profits remain strong. Net income for the company for the first
half of 2000 was 2,606 millions of euros (equivalent to approximately $2.2
billion), representing a 119-percent increase. Eni is largely considered
one of the best buys among the big oil stocks, but it would rather merge
with an equal partner than be sold to another company. As consolidation
of the oil industry continues, Eni reportedly believes that the only way
to remain a top player is to marry an equally large player on the world
stage.

Enron may be at the top of Eni's list of merger partners. Negotiations
with Spain's largest oil company, Repsol, appear to have stalled, as was
confirmed when Mincato stated that any "link-up with Repsol would not be
a merger of equals." French oil company TotalFina is also interested, but
is preoccupied with its own acquisition of fellow French oil company Elf.
Other companies that have been mentioned include Conoco and Phillips
Petroleum.
It is quite obvious that Eni's merger prospects are predominantly oil
companies,
which is quite clearly the company's intention. Thus, it may seem odd that
Enron is also included as a top prospect. Enron, while unquestionably a
world player, is known for its unorthodox approach to hard assets. Put
succinctly, Enron believes that it doesn't need to own physical assets
in order to be a major player, but rather it only needs to rely on strategic

contractual agreements.

However, if Eni wants to continue to expand globally, it arguably could
not find a better partner than Enron, generally considered North America's
biggest buyer and seller of electricity and natural gas. Enron's gas trading

and distribution activities in particular-along with its electricity
production,
raw material trading and broadband expansion-would all appear to be good
compliments to Eni's portfolio. Reports of talks between the two companies
first appeared in the Italian financial paper iL Sole 24 Ore, based on
input from an unnamed source. The report indicated that Enron is being
targeted by Eni for an equity partnership or even a full merger. Mincato,
as recently as Tuesday of this week, continues to adamantly deny that any
deal with Enron is being studied.

Not surprisingly, Enron is remaining mum on the rumors and has not even
mentioned Eni in any recent disclosures. However, the incorporation of
Eni's power production portfolio would support Enron's expansion into new
markets such as Japan, for example. Back in March, the Japanese government
began allowing non-utility firms to supply power to industrial and
commercial
end-users. Almost simultaneously, Enron established a new subsidiary, Enron
Japan Corp., to capitalize on new opportunities in the country. Enron
Japan's
first offer is a 10-percent discount off current electricity prices for
customers who sign on with Enron for two to four years. Operating against
its North American strategy, Enron also plans to build a power station
in northern Japan, beating to the punch several of its key rivals, including

Vivendi, Texaco and Royal Dutch Shell, which also have expressed interest
in establishing operations in the country.

Enron's proposed power plant should give the company prime access to
companies
in the Tohoku and Kanto regions, as well as Tokyo, the "big catch" of the
Japanese market. In my opinion, herein lies the primary synergy that would
make the partnership between Eni and Enron a strategic step for both
companies.
As Eni attempts to position itself in various key markets, Japan seems
like a natural location, and I've seen no reports that indicate Eni is
moving into Japan on its own. The fact that Enron is already there, along
with most other lucrative international markets, must certainly be appealing

to Eni. Regarding Enron's perspective on any potential partnering, Eni's
substantial oil and natural-gas generation assets, along with its current
lock on the European market, must be very attractive.

Enron's current market capitalization is about $48 billion, which actually
makes it larger than Eni. This raises the question of which company would
be the buying partner if a merger were to indeed take place. All of the
rumors flying around currently speak of Eni pursuing Enron, but it could
just as easily be the other way around. Those of us who follow Enron closely

may find it hard to believe that the powerhouse company would ever be the
target for a takeover or even a merger. In any case, the rumors continue
to fly as Eni responds to claims of "thou doth protest too much." Whether
or not any such merger between Eni and Enron, which appears smart on paper,
will materialize remains to be seen. However, it certainly seems like Eni
is lining up its chess pieces to cement some kind of partnership in the
very near future.

Subject: PGE legal report

Jim, I need to apologize and confess I skipped the call this morning because
of an uncontrollable addiction to the Presidential election proceedings. 
David Boies and Barry Richards were just too much to pass up.  Sorry.  
Not much here.  We settled the Beaver lease cases at the same price we paid
the other lessors and without any of their attorney fees.  Good result.  We
have FERC approval of the Sierra sale.  SEC looks good for Jan or Feb.  
I am working with Richard Sanders and Robin Gibb on defense to the California
class actions.  
We have a new offer from BNFL that will be the subject of a conference call
soon.  Looks like they will pay us about 75% of our damages to go away.  
One new risk is the upcoming cold spell and very high Northwest prices.  This
will cost us a lot of money, possibly not recoverable from customers, and may
spread the litigation over high prices to the Northwest.  This could develop
as a risk to the Sierra sale in the extreme, but right now appears manageble. 
More on this as it develops.  The Enron litigation team is here on Monday and
we will cooperate on strategy and resources as prudent.  
Finally, we have received a settlement offer on the Grant County case that
looks good and we are pursuing it.  Al.

Sandeep, 

Find out which firm Justin is discussing with. Hopefully, it is a "good" 
firm, both in terms of quality and absence of conflicts with what we've done 
in India to date. Let me know.

I hope Justin contacted someone in Enron legal with some experience in India 
before he hired a firm. Hopefully, he talked with you first, as this is 
common courtesy. Maybe he talked with Sarah G, and that would be fine also as 
she is generally aware of the Indian firms we use and don't use.

Thank you for your quick response!

As I suspected, I was slow on the draw.  Justin Boyd with our London team has 
already directed a firm in India to start looking at these issues.

I'll forward your email to Justin, as he very well may want to coordinate 
some of this through Sandeep, if Sandeep has the capacity to help us out.  

Thanks again for your help.

Sandeep Katwala is our general counsel in India, and he should be able to 
work with you and outside counsel on this. Sandeep -- since this is a bit of 
a rush, I would like for either you or perhaps Lena to work directly with 
Travis and outside counsel and try to get some quick answers. 

Thanks,

Subject: Clickpaper.com - Indian legal issues

Wade:

I hope things are going well for you.  It was good to see you the other day.  
I'm not even sure where you are right now, but I imagine that you are 
checking your e-mail, wherever you are.  I was hoping you could give us a 
little guidance on tracking down some Indian legal issues -- perhaps a 
reference to someone that could assist us.

Clickpaper.com is Enron's electronic  trading marketplace for pulp, paper and 
lumber products (including derivative products).  It is modeled after 
EnronOnline, but specializes in these commodities.  The team is in the 
process of registering customers around the world to access and trade on the 
Clickpaper website;  in keeping with the EOL business model, Clickpaper 
enters into access and trading agreements with every customer that govern 
their use of and trading on the site.

Those access and trading agreements are "jurisdiction specific" -- customized 
for the particular country in which the customer accessing the site is based 
-- in order to deal with jurisdiction-specific legal issues associated with 
accessing, or contracting via, the internet, financial trading, regulatory 
issues, etc.   

The team has identified India as having a large number of potential 
customers, and is attending a trade show in New Delhi in early December, and 
they would like to be able to sign customers up at that trade show, or at the 
very least arrange to give them access to the site.  We therefore need to 
consult with legal counsel in India to identify any issues and prepare an 
apporpriate access and trading agreement.  EnronOnline has developed a due 
diligence checklist which is very helpful in describing our business model 
and raising specific legal issues that we are likely to encounter.

Could you refer me to in-house counsel or an outside firm that could assist 
us with this project on an expedited basis (isn't that always the case 
here)?  I would really appreciate any help you could give to us.

To the other  recipients of this message  -- I know that there are several 
people working on this project -- if you already have this project underway, 
please let Wade and I know so we aren't duplicating  your efforts.  Thanks.

		 Subject: EECC Litigation Update - Puerto Rico, Marmara, Dabhol


I would like to update the legal report I just sent to you as follows:

   Puerto Rico:  Larry Izzo had a conference call with Misson Energy
   regarding the claims between EECC and EcoElectrica. Enron's shareholder
   representative was also involved.  The parties reached agreement in
   principle on the open issues (the owner dropped its claims against EECC,
   EECC relinquished two smaller claims, the Owner will pay EECC's
   remaining claims).  Bracewell's analysis of the claims was very helpful
   in reaching this result.
   Marmara: As expected, Black&Veatch has filed a formal notice of
   arbitration against EECC relative to sums they claim are due them with
   respect to the Marmara Project. EECC management expects that this will
   be settled early next year, and that it may provide an opportunity to
   reach a global settlement with Black & Veatch re Puerto Rico and
   potential future work.  Gail Brownfeld and Scott Burdine of Hagans, Bob,
   Burdine are both up to speed.
   Dabhol: Besix has informed us that we will be receiving thier notice of
   arbitration re the Dabhol Quarry before the end of the year. We are told
   that they have changed their counsel, apparently releasing the English
   firm of Masons and engaging a firm in Washington DC of Watts, Tieder,
   Hoffer & Fitzgerald to carry the claim forward. This is an unusual move,
   since the contract is governed by English law and the site of the
   arbitration will London. Besix's local representative told  our project
   manager that Besix was not happy with the Masons advice, but it may be
   that they want a US firm involved, backed up by an English firm. I have
   asked Phil Bruns to check into the reputation of  Watts, Teider. He was
   not familiar with them, but has found that it is a 67 lawyer firm that
   specializes in construction and real with a main office in northern
   Virginia and offices in California. Gail Brownfeld, Phil Bruns, and
   Jonathon Rosshandler are all aware of this development.

I attach the results of a first trawl through the archives.

Of the attached materials,I think that the most relevant,for present
purposes,will be the following:-

(1) the enforcement memo produced by Peter Cornell and Atul Rajadhyaksha;

(2) the final consent award (as I drafted it) (the tribunal made the award
in the terms requested so far as I can recall;we are retrieving the original
from the papers in storage).

Item (2) above binds the GOM in relation to the PPA,SSA and the GOM
Guarantee. However,strictly,the MSEB is not bound,because it was never a
party to the 2 arbitrations begun by DPC in August 1995.

Jim: 

Celina Ozorio is a paralegal in the Rio office who has performed very well 
this past year and who we would like recommend for promotion to a junior 
attorney (Attorney I) position.  I have discussed this with both Randy and 
Rob and they support this move.  

Celina is a Brazilian-qualified lawyer with a U.S. LLM who was hired a year 
ago as a paralegal rather than as an attorney due to her relative lack of law 
firm experience.  During the past year she has been enthusiastic in pursuing 
her professional development and demonstrating her capabilites as a 
professional.  She has actively sought out opportunities to take on more 
responsibility and to learn more about our business and has worked very hard 
to win the confidence of the lawyers and clients with whom she works.  We 
believe that she has demonstrated the ability to operate at the junior 
attorney level now and the potential to develop into a solid senior Enron 
attorney in the future.  As a junior attorney, she would continue to work 
under the supervision of more senior attorneys and would have the opportunity 
to continue her professional development.  

I understand that we have done this elsewhere in the Company and believe that 
it sends the right message to others in the department that there are 
opportunities for advancement and that hard work and merit are rewarded.

Please let me know how you feel about this recommendation and whether you 
think it would be appropriate for us to schedule her to visit with you in 
Houston.  Thanks.

Regards,
 John

As there are several new members of the Committee, I have been asked to
forward the following memorandum, which was sent to the membership on June
1, 2000 regarding the Committee's List Serve and how to use it. In addition
to this information, please note that the email address that you send the
message from must be the address that was given to the Committee (i.e. if
your business email address is on the List Serve, you cannot send a message
to the List Serve from your home email address), otherwise your message will
not transmit to the List Serve.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at (404) 249-2717
or at emily.ward@bellsouth.com.

MEMORANDUM


To:             Committee of Corporate General Counsel

From:           Thomas A. Decker

Date:           June 1, 2000

Re:             Committee's List Serve

One of the greatest benefits that we derive from being a member of the
Committee of Corporate General Counsel is the opportunity to communicate
with our peers and discuss matters common to us as General Counsel. The
Committee provides us with a forum to exchange ideas and experiences about
substantive, administrative and ethical law issues facing us and our
corporate clients. It also provides us opportunities for informal networking
among our peers.

In an effort to provide an additional avenue in which we may communicate, a
"List Serve" has been created for our Committee. A "List Serve" is an
Internet email device used to forward information to large numbers of
addresses at one time. The address for our Committee is corpgen@abanet.org.
All members of the Committee who have provided email addresses have been
placed in the "List Serve." To use the "List Serve," you simply address your
Internet email message to "corpgen@abanet.org" and your message will be sent
to all of the members.

The Executive Committee intends to use this device to communicate
information to the Committee regarding meetings and issues that effect the
Committee as a whole. Members are encouraged to use it to obtain information
and exchange ideas with other members of the Committee, such as
recommendations for outside counsel and networking for prospective hires. If
you wish to communicate to only a few members on the Committee, do not use
this device. Rather, send your message to the individual members, using
their e-mail addresses included on the Committee membership list. Also,
please note that if you choose the "reply all" button (versus the "sender
only" button), when responding to a message to this address, your reply will
not only go to the sender of the original message, but to the entire "List
Serve." (We have learned, from other Committees using a list serve, that
this can cause an abundance of mail to be forwarded to and from e-mail
systems which can overload some systems.)

If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact Emily N.
Ward at (404) 249-2717 or at emily.ward@bellsouth.com.
