The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly capacity requirements:



   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	Capacity From East Desk	
May	22,300	0	22,300	0	
June	22,300	0	22,300	0	
July	22,300	0	22,300	0	
August	22,300	0	22,300	0	
September	22,300	0	22,300	0	


  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




	

   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity (Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk	
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0	
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412	
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112	
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460	
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690	
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0	


NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

Subject: Ft Pierce

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King 
Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?

Just a small correction.  The demand number of $.85 is actually $.8215, 
commodity is $.0307 and fuel is 3%.  The unofficial in service date is 5/03.  
Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

Charlie,

My original message was:

The new plant max consumption for planning purposes should be set at 2,490 mmBtu/hr HHV.  In addition to this it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require 335 mmBtur/hr HHV, or a total of 2,825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

The plant consumption is based on the maximum combustion turbine requirement, plus a 5% margin, plus duct burning requirement.  This should be adequate as a conservative maximum case.

In answer to your follow up question I'll provide the following detail for clarity:

At the max consumption case:

GT Gas consumption is 1825 mmBtu/hr LHV = 2024 mmBtu/hr HHV producing gross gas turbine power of 200 MW, or a gross GT heat rate of 10,120 Btu/kwh HHV

Additional Duct Firing fuel of 353 mmBtu/hr HHV is used to produce steam for exiting steam turbines, including unit 6.  Gross steam turbine output is 105 MW.

Total Gross Generation is 305 MW with total new plant gas consumption of 2377 mmBtu/hr HHV.  

Net power production from new gas turbine and the exiting steam turbines is 305MW less auxiliary load of 24 MW for a net of 281 MW.  At 2377 MMBtu/hr HHV this gives a net heat rate of 8459 Btu/kwh HHV.

The above numbers are new and clean.

A fuel margin of 113 MMBtu/hr has been added to give margined plant consumption of 2490 mmBtu/hr.  This was based on 5% margin on GT fuel, and rounding up somewhat to a comfortable number.

This would make the margined plant heat rate equal to 2490mmBtu/hr/281MW or 8861 Btu/kwh HHV.

In addition to the fuel for the new facilities, it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require up to 335 mmBtu/hr.  If this is included, then the total fuel delivered to site would be 2825 mmBtu/hr HHV.

If you have additional questions please let me know.

Thanks!

Mike

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec 
for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been 
working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. 
Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the 
inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this 
issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to 
burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

	The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

	The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    

	Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  

	Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

	At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

	The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

	Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

		Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

		Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

		We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

		The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

		None that we are aware of.

Jim & Nick,
In order to be consistent concerning the use of ICF curves or ENA curves in the Fort Pierce model, do you think that it is necessary to run the spread option model for ICF curves?  I believe that I need to have the capability to input Variable O&M and Per start expenses in the model that I am running with ICF curves.  Please advise.  Thank you.  Jennifer

Jennifer, attached is a summary model of the Ft. Pierce evaluation using Enron's curves.  Please note that there are two scenarios provided, based on a best case and worst case pipeline demand charge scenario.  The spread option model was dispatched based on the same assumptions as utilized by the gas group in developing their pipeline cost assumptions.  I've tried to add notes to the models outlining potential areas of additional value as there are some unique characteristics of this deal that should provide additional value to the project.  I'll be over to help review the cash flow model.  

Thanks for everyone's help (Edith/Charlie)

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?

Yesterday I faxed a copy of Colonial Pipeline's specifications for fungible 
low sulfur diesel fuel (74 grade) to Mark Breese. That spec sheet is 
indicative of the specs for low sulfur diesel in Florida. It must be 
remembered that Florida has no refineries nor product pipelines and receives 
their fuel via barges and vessels from domestic and international refineries 
and terminals. Will forward Colonial jet fuel (54 grade) specs.

Subject: Re: Fuel Specification Requirements

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 
Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined 
spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and 
Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what 
is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too 
stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably 
attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your 
feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are 
spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to 
proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get 
contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  
Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for 
different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue 
internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any 
other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the 
following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
 chromium

Subject: Re: Fuel Specification Requirements  

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order 
for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no 
ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, 
I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs 
included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The 
second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to 
increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash 
to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for 
column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

This sample tested by Saybolt was from a shore tank of low sulfur diesel (Colonial 74 grade) in a major's tank in the Houston area. This is representative of the low sulfur diesel that would be shipped to Florida. Fax is on it's way. Any questions call me at x35007.

Fax is 646-3460.  A couple folks wanted to know where this sample was taken from.  I told them that I was not exactly sure but was confident that the sample would be representative of the fuel oil that would be delivered in Florida, per our conversation.


Thanks again,

Subject: Re: ICAP?  

ICAP is installed capacity.  You sometimes hear it referred to as RegCap 
(regulatory capacity).  In some of the northern markets you must demonstrate 
that you have enough capacity (ICAP) to cover your max peak.  This capacity 
doesn't necessarily have to be used to serve your load  (This is the most 
confusing part).  If you owned a plant, you could sell the ICAP and energy 
off that plant to two different counterparties.  What Kevin's is pointing out 
that the FL RTO will require ICAP, therefore, if we owned steel in the 
ground, we would receive the benefit of being able to sell the capacity AND 
the energy.  

Not all of the markets require ICAP, therefore, it is good to clarify what 
people mean when they use the word capacity.  In some markets, the capacity 
price is imbedded in the energy price.  Capacity is a very loosely used term 
in the electricity industry.    I am sure this is clear as mud.  It's kind of 
hard explain in an e-mail.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. 
King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions 
except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on 
the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether 
the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our 
quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the 
engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon 
order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and 
to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at 
x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

 The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

 The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings?    

 Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from 
Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl 
the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?  

 Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on 
a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line 
of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the 
neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

 At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort 
Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that 
location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) 
after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

 The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

 Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

  Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the 
issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

  Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

  We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you 
would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

  The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

  None that we are aware of.

HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following 
is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be 
in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% 
higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so 
divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 
Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966
Gross Heat of Combustion, BTU/Lbs	D-240 or D-4868	19,520	19,780

Doug,

Thanks for the info.  I have passed it along.

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV 
and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that 
are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  


Thanks,

Charlie

I believe we probably have a miscommunication here.  I think somewhere we've mistaken 0.05% by weight with 0.05 ppm.

Vanadium is a heavy metal that falls out in the residual oil, and is typically not an issue with No. 2 oil.  That's why it's not usually in the spec for No. 2.

Bill Fox:  Please check and see where the 0.05% came from regarding MHI, and confirm that it's not ppm.  In the meantime, everyone should assume that vanadium is not an issue with regard to the gas turbine using No. 2 fuel.

Thanks!

Mike

Charlie,

It's my understanding that the steam turbine outputs are:

No. 6    14 MW
No. 7	25 MW
No. 8    57 MW

These are nominal outputs--they may not add up to the gross 105 used in the gas calculation, so just apportion them as necessary.

Thanks!

Mike

I got this message for a contractor that might be interested in working with us on the lateral.  Steve Thome had good luck with them on a water line and wanted to pass the name along.  He also called and mentioned a guy who is with an Enron affiliate - Northern Border - and is interested in a pipeline spur as well.  His phone number is 303-575-6479.  May be helpful to keep it in the Enron family.

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the next several days.

Fuel Guys,

The information that y'all had requested in the meeting does not contain any 
output or heat balancing information that you will need to assist in the 
sizing of the lateral.  Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that 
contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  
We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat 
rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after 
today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you 
really need.  As soon as we receive new output and heat rate information, I 
will forward it directly.  If, for some reason, you need capital costs and 
property tax information, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

Darrell,

There still appears to be some confusion regarding the inclusion of FPUA's #6 ST into the deal.  The heat rate of the #6 ST should not be included in the overall plant heat rate (neither gross nor net).  The heat rate of the facility should include the GT and FPUA's #7 and #8 STs.  Duct firing #6 needs to be determined and calculated on a stand-alone basis.  Bottom line:  whether FPUA or FPRP uses #6 to generate power, the heat rate associated with #6 is the duct fired heat rate.  I have been anticipating results to look something like the following:

Combined Cycle HHV		7,800 heat rate (based on 183MW + 82MW = 265MW using 2,067MMBtu/hr)
FPUA 9,500 HHV		9,500 heat rate on 82MW = 779MMBtu/hr
FPRP Combined Cycle HHV	2,067MMBtu/hr - 779MMBtu/hr = 1,288MMBtu/hr for 183MW = 7,038 heat rate

Duct Firing HHV			10,000 heat rate on 14MW = 140MMBtu/hr (should equal the actual amount of additional gas needed to duct fire)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Mathew

I'd like to set up meeting to review performance inputs to proforma ... today 5/7 at 2:30 PM 3AC 33C1.

Jennifer, please coordinate with ENA participants and with Sandra R @ 5_6426 to ensure we have the essential folks available.

Updated Proforma Input (Still Preliminary)
We worked with CMI much of last week to revise HRSG configuration to accommodate addition of ST#6. This is turning out to be moderate change to design ... potential cost/schedule impacts still under assessment ... continuing/should finalize this week. Also updated assessment of aux loads -- increased split to GT resulting in reduced net output. 

Output = 185 - 3.5 = 181.5 MW net (due to higher GT aux loads)

HR (Plant-net) = 7980/7196 HHV/LHV (increased due to impact of ST#6)

HR (GT-gross) = 10,326/9311 HHV/LHV 

Degradation -- See attached curves ... this is the best currently available degradation data. It's a Sieman-Westinghouse curve -- still trying to get MHI data. Typically, either apply curves or use ~5% flat degradation as alternative. Needs to be coordinated with Operating/maintenance plan.

 

I'll be working with engineering personnel to firm up as much as possible and be ready for meeting this afternoon.

thx/dgs

A couple of quick questions about the truck deliveries to the H. D. King 
Power plant location:

1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?
2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?
3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings? 

Outstanding issues:

1) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees
2) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?
3) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?
4) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating
5) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant
6) Design a fuel resupply plan including prepurchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods
7) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers
8) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)
9) Commercial start date of plan
10) Any other issue to be discussed

Did I leave anything out?

Mark and Charlie,

FMPA is ready to bill us for the oil, but they have a couple of questions.  They want to know whom and where do they send the invoice and what should they reference.  Email your response or any questions to Steve McElhaney at FMPA (steve.mcelhaney@fmpa.com).

In case I forgot to tell y'all, I am going on vacation (right now) through 7/16.  I'll have my cell phone and will check voicemails periodically.

Thanks again for your help and if I miss you, have a great Fourth,

I spoke to Ed and Steve Treece at the plant this morning. Please confirm that Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record and whom do we send the invoices to. Both Ed and Steve were confused regarding this issue. I also need in writing asap (email ok) from someone within the project deal team that Enron will guarantee the fuel payment on behalf of FPUA. You need to be aware that the plant only has one truck unloading bay. That is fine with a 200,000 gallon tank fill with no rush, but will be unacceptable when you need the 800,000 gallons tank fill or are burning diesel as a primary fuel. What plans are in the works to build another truck unloading bay? When will that bay be operational?

Doug,

The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)


Thanks,

Charlie

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the next several days.

Charlie:

Per our conversation earlier today, I outline below the steps to proceed in addressing the following four taxes:  Federal Excise Tax, Pollutant Fee, Florida State Tax and Local Option Fee.  

It is my understanding that Central Oil has paid all four taxes and is currently billing Florida Municipal Power Agency ("FMPA") for the same.  Enron has agreed to reimburse FMPA for all such moneys FMPA pays to Central Oil for the Pollutant Fee.  FMPA will be made whole for the moneys paid to Central Oil related to the Federal Excise Tax, Florida State Tax and the Local Option Fee in the form of a refund from either the IRS or the state of Florida.

Federal Excise Tax
A technical reading related to claims and refunds of Federal Excise Tax on diesel fuel provides that if undyed fuel is sold, tax must be charged.  Only the end user can apply for a credit or refund.  Per a Fort Pierce Utilities Authority ("FPUA") letter I received today which was included in a fax from Karlan White at Central Oil, FMPA would be the party who ultimately will pay the fuel bill for the oil (to expedite payment).  The billing address, however, will be FPUA; such address would show on the invoices.  Ultimately FPUA is the end user of the oil.

Nevertheless, I suggest FMPA actually complete the attached Form 8849 and remit such form to the address noted in the instructions.  FMPA is the party doing the financial transacting with Central Oil (on behalf of FPUA).  At the same time, FMPA should pay the related Federal Excise Taxes to Central Oil since Central Oil has already remitted such moneys to the IRS.

The rationale for FPMA filing Form 8849 and not FPUA is that FMPA is the party making the payment to Central Oil.  Nevertheless, there is a slight chance the IRS will require FPUA to file the Form 8849 itself.  For administrative purposes, though, I suggest FMPA be the party to file.  If the IRS does not accept the filing, we can then resubmit Form 8849 using FPUA as the filing entity.

Pollutant Fee
FMPA agrees to reimburse the Pollutant Fee to Central Oil.

Florida State Tax and Local Option Fee
FMPA must reimburse Central Oil for both the Florida State Tax and the Local Option Fee.  At the same time, FMPA should complete and file the attached Form DR-26, Application for Refund, with the Florida Department of Revenue.  


   

If you have any additional questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,

Justin

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Yesterday I faxed a copy of Colonial Pipeline's specifications for fungible low sulfur diesel fuel (74 grade) to Mark Breese. That spec sheet is indicative of the specs for low sulfur diesel in Florida. It must be remembered that Florida has no refineries nor product pipelines and receives their fuel via barges and vessels from domestic and international refineries and terminals. Will forward Colonial jet fuel (54 grade) specs.

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements

Doug,

Attached is the (long-awaited) spec for the 200K gallons of low-sulphur #2 Fuel Oil to partially refill the tank at the Ft. Pierce facility in Florida.
As the attached note describes, the final spec is a result of the combined spec requirements by the environmental permit, MHI (Mitsubishi), and Engineering.

We currently believe that some of these specs may be more stringent than what is commercially available.  In the event that some of these specs are too stringent, we would like you to: 1) identify which specs are not reasonably attainable, and 2) suggest what value of these specs are attainable.   Your feedback will be shared with the appropriate parties and, assuming there are spec change recommendations, these parties will determine how best to proceed.  

Please note that the first attached note requests than any bids we get contain info on density, heating value, and trace contaminants.  Additionally, the second attached note references getting multiple bids for different specs.  I suggest that, for now, we resolve the spec issue internally as described above and then we obtain quotes.   If you have any other suggestions on how best to proceed, your input is welcome.

Your assistance in this matter is, and has been, greatly appreciated.


Thanks,

Charlie Weldon

	Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
	chromium
	arsenic
	siloxenes
	copper corrosivity
	cetane index

Subject:	Re: Fuel Specification Requirements   

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Ray

At this stage we will have to assume that this is definitely their final answer to the ash content issue.

Subject: Update of Fuel Oil Analysis

Team,

Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so 
fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is 
we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months 
and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the 
specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from 
Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must 
meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review 
process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any 
questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.

Thank you,

Matthew Tezyk

Mark -- 

(1)  We can use the MHI turbine specs that we have now.  The turbine team will be telling everyone that final specs (on everything in the turbine contract) will not be final for a while, so you have to use what is available now.  In reality, not much will actually change.  Just use their current oil spec sheet.

(2)  We have the opportunity to sell more than 200,00 gallons now, but we need a price to work the extra deal.  

(3)  If extra time for filling is desired (as in a put), then let me know the parameters, and I will try to get it agreed to.  Starting to fill on time is important, but if we take some extra time to finish, that might be okay.

(4)  Regarding the comment about not wanting too many trucks lined up and causing traffic congestion, there is room in two spots near the plant to "stage" a series of trucks.  If this info would be useful, let me know.

Subject:	Responses to your questions on fuel oil for Fort Pierce facility



Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

	The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

	The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?    

	Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?  

	Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

	At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

	The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

	Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

		Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

		Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

		We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

		The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

		None that we are aware of.

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.

Bill,

I understand that you are the contact person for MHI concerning the ash spec for the 501F turbine being used on the Ft. Pierce project.  I have been working with Matt Tezyk to finalize all issues concerning this fuel oil spec. Please let me know as soon as possible what the MHI response is regarding the inability to get 0% ash fuel oil.   We are trying to get closure on this issue so we can order the fuel oil to replace that which we caused FPUA to burn to begin construction on the site.

Thanks!

 Attached below is the fuel oil specification.  Our Engineering group has 
reviewed all Vendor and Air Permit requirements, and the sheet labeled "Fuel 
Oil Spec" is the fuel oil specification.  The sheet labeled "Comparison 
Specs" is the other data you requested for comparison.  When using the fuel 
oil specification to purchase fuel, please have the vendors provide the 
following information:

Density at reference temperature
Heating Values at reference temperature
Maximum trace contaminant limits:
 chromium
 arsenic
 siloxenes
 copper corrosivity
 cetane index
 cetane number

Thank you,

Matt

Subject: Re: Fuel Specification Requirements  

Matt-

I talked with Bill Fox and Doug Ottens concerning the fuel spec.  In order 
for MHI to meet the particulate emissions, we must provide a fuel oil with no 
ash.  Additionally, vanadium is a catalyst poison, so to meet the CMI needs, 
I reduced the vanadium.

I am attaching a revised fuel oil spec matrix, which has four fuel specs 
included.  The first column meets the minimum requirements of MHI & CMI.  The 
second column holds the ash at the low value, but allows the vanadium to 
increase.  The third column holds the low vanadium value, but allows the ash 
to increase.  The last column allow both the ash and vanadium to increase.

ENA will need to get bids for column 1 and may want to solicit bids for 
column 2, 3, & 4 for economic comparison purposes.

Jennifer, attached is a summary model of the Ft. Pierce evaluation using Enron's curves.  Please note that there are two scenarios provided, based on a best case and worst case pipeline demand charge scenario.  The spread option model was dispatched based on the same assumptions as utilized by the gas group in developing their pipeline cost assumptions.  I've tried to add notes to the models outlining potential areas of additional value as there are some unique characteristics of this deal that should provide additional value to the project.  I'll be over to help review the cash flow model.  

Thanks for everyone's help (Edith/Charlie)

HHV is not the proper terminology, Gross Heat of Combustion is. The following is for Light diesel. First number is min, second is max. Jet fuel should be in the same ballpark as Light Diesel. Gross Heat of Combustion is about 6.4% higher than Net Heat of Combustion (incorrectly referred to as LHV), so divide the Gross numbers by 1.064 to obtain Net numbers. 

Gross Heat of Combustion, Kcal/Kg	D-240 or D-4868	10,820	10,966	
Gross Heat of Combustion, BTU/Lbs	D-240 or D-4868	19,520	19,780

I have one more question regarding heating values.  Do you know what the LHV and HHV values are for #2 and jet fuel?  I figure those are parameters that are measured and known but they weren't on the spec sheet.  


Thanks,

Charlie

Can you tell me what the lowest reasonable ash content readily available is?  We will submit the lowest reasonably attainable spec to MHI and ask them to assure that they will meet the PM10 requirements.

Thanks!

Mike

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 
4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. 
of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug 
reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want 
to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches 
to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a 
logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by 
buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, 
his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) 
as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the 
next several days.

The following basic assumptions concerning gas capacity requirements for the 
Fort Pierce project were confirmed today at a meeting attended by Dave 
Fairley, Ed McMichael, Ruth Concannon, Mark Breese, Eric Boyt, and Charlie 
Weldon.   (NOTE:  The heat rates and MW are subject to change pending final 
engineering evaluation.  The intent of this note is to document the overall 
runtime assumptions.)

1) During the summertime months of May through September, the plant is 
expected to run 16 hours per day in a mode where  Enron's 200 MW are 
dispatched as are Ft. Pierce's 82MW.

2)  Enron will purchase summertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
200 MW for 16 hours per day at our "bought-down" heat rate of 6690.  This 
equals 22,300 MMBTU/day and will allow for taking the full daily capacity in 
only a 16 hour period (6% per hour)  The table below summarizes the monthly 
capacity requirements:


   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 	
Capacity From East Desk
May	22,300	0	22,300	0
June	22,300	0	22,300	0
July	22,300	0	22,300	0
August	22,300	0	22,300	0
September	22,300	0	22,300	0

  NTOE:  Prior to Phase VI completion, the project will purchase capacity 
from the East Desk.

3)  Ft. Pierce will use its existing FT via FGU to secure its gas 
requirements at the 9500 contractual heat rate for the 16 hours it is 
dispatched in the summer.

4)  For the winter months of October through April, the plant is expected to 
run 16 hours per day in a mode where Ft. Pierce is not dispatched, thus 
leaving Enron with 282MW at the overall plant heat rate of 7500.  This 
equates to 35,251 MMBTU/day and allows for taking the full capacity in only 
16 hours (6% per hour)

5)  Because Ft. Pierce will not be dispatched during the winter, their unused 
capacity via FGU will be available for Enron.  These amounts differ by month 
as summarized in the table below.

6) Enron will purchase wintertime capacity only sufficient to allow running 
282 MW for 16 hours per day at a 7500 heat rate, less the monthly capacities 
available from Ft. Pierce via FGU.  These non-FGU purchased quantities will 
come from the Phase VI capacity and the East Desk as shown below:




 
   MONTH	Total Capacity Needed By Enron	Ft. Pierce Capacity (from FGU)	Phase VI Capacity 
(Nov-Mar = 28% of Summer)	Capacity From East Desk
October	35,251	14,665	22,300	0
November	35,251	14,595	6,244	14,412
December	35,251	14,895	6,244	14,112
January	35,251	16,547	6,244	12,460
February	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
March	35,251	15,317	6,244	13,690
April	35,251	15,317	22,300	0

NOTE:  Prior to Phase VI completion , the project will purchase capacity from 
the East Desk.

7)  Backup documentation supporting the hourly gas requirement in each 
dispatch mode is attached to this memo.

I spoke to Ed and Steve Treece at the plant this morning. Please confirm that Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record and whom do we send the invoices to. Both Ed and Steve were confused regarding this issue. I also need in writing asap (email ok) from someone within the project deal team that Enron will guarantee the fuel payment on behalf of FPUA. You need to be aware that the plant only has one truck unloading bay. That is fine with a 200,000 gallon tank fill with no rush, but will be unacceptable when you need the 800,000 gallons tank fill or are burning diesel as a primary fuel. What plans are in the works to build another truck unloading bay? When will that bay be operational?

Doug,

The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)


Thanks,

Charlie

I purchased 202,000 gallons of low sulfur diesel fuel from Central Oil Company (sub of Martin Gas) to be delivered to the Fort Pierce power plant starting on May 29 through June 5. A typical truck delivery is 7500 gallons so there will be about 27 truck deliveries. Deliveries will be made between 7:00am and 5:00pm during week days only. The fuel is priced at $0.9800/gallon delivered to the plant plus any applicable local, state and federal taxes. The fuel will be undyed. The current buyer of record to be shown on the bill of lading truck ticket will be Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority unless told otherwise prior to the first delivery. The truck scheduler at Central Oil is Tim Dick (813/448-2105) and he will coordinate with Steve Treece at Ft. Pierce. I have communicated all of the information above to Steve. Upon completion of the tank fill I recommend FPUA take a fuel sample and test for all appropriate diesel fuel quality specifications.

Charlie,

Based on your response, copied below, on the ash content of the fuel required, and MHI's response, also copied below, identifying the ash limits to meet PM10 specifications, it appears there is not a problem.

Thanks,

Mike Coleman

Ash Content of the Fuel Available:

Mike,

The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.


Thanks,

Charlie




MHI requirements for Ash:

2. Enron FPRP-EEOS-MHI-0016
   Max. Allowable Limit for Fuel Oil Ash Content
  (MHI Response)
  Max. allowable limit for PM-10 front-half guarantee of 10mg/Nm3 at GT
  100% load on oil firing are as follows:
  Ash content (10% residuum basis)            0.1%
  Ramsbottom Carbon Residue (10% residuum basis)   0.15%

Mike, in going over Contract Exhibit A to revise the Ash Content in Section 4, Fuel Oil Specification,  I ran across a note in my work file from an April 18 e-mail response from MHI where they transmitted two comments back to us  on their review of Exhibit A.

The first comment is on the viscosity value that Enron listed in Section 4.  Our value listed is 6.8 Cst (max.).  MHI comment is "Please supply fuel oil with maximum viscosity 5.8 Cst at any temperature".

The second MHI comment just re-emphasizes our listed value for Barium, Manganese and Phosphorus which is shown as 2 ppm (wt) (Max.).  MHI comment is "Please limit Ba, Mg, Phosphorous within max. 2 ppm." 

Please let me know if we can accomodated the MHI comment on the viscosity and revise the value from our original 6.8 Cst down to the 5.8 Cst value that MHI is requesting.  Doug Ottens does not think that using the MHI value will be a problem.

The second MHI comment has no impact on the Exhibit as the 2 ppm (Max.) is what we have listed for the value.

Let me know so that I can revise this Exhibit A and send it on to Mark Thurber for inclusion in the revised MHI P.O. Contract.

Thanks,
Frank

Following our Ft. Pierce meeting this morning, Ozzie Pagan's called me and 
requested a "physical basis" offer for the following deal.  This request is 
the answer to the question David Fairley was going to ask the power guys.  
Neither the FGU RFP  nor the current Ft. Pierce supply option will impact the

Saybolt test result for low sulfur #2 vanadium is less than 0.1ppm using ASTM D-3605. Give me your fax number and I can send you a copy.

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.


Charlie

Subject: Oil Status UPdate -- response to your questions

   

I spoke with Doug Leach regarding your questions.  He has already contacted 
4-5 suppliers/truckers and is ready to rock and roll when we know what spec. 
of No. 2 we need.  As such, they are all set to supply our requirement.  Doug 
reiterated his interest in looking at the long-term relationship we may want 
to build with a supplier.  He is particularly concerned if the plant switches 
to oil for a significant amount, supplying large quantities will be a 
logistical nightmare.  


He agrees that we can hedge 80-90 (if not 100%) of the commodity risk by 
buying the Gulf Coast contract (there is no basis traded for FL).  However, 
his market view is for prices to come off (they have already dropped a bit) 
as a result of gasoline prices cooling off.

He has scheduled the test for Vandium today.  We should get results in the 
next several days.

I spoke to Ed and Steve Treece at the plant this morning. Please confirm that Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record and whom do we send the invoices to. Both Ed and Steve were confused regarding this issue. I also need in writing asap (email ok) from someone within the project deal team that Enron will guarantee the fuel payment on behalf of FPUA. You need to be aware that the plant only has one truck unloading bay. That is fine with a 200,000 gallon tank fill with no rush, but will be unacceptable when you need the 800,000 gallons tank fill or are burning diesel as a primary fuel. What plans are in the works to build another truck unloading bay? When will that bay be operational?

Doug,

The contact at the HD King plant is Ed Leongomez.  His phone number is 561-464-5792.  Ed is the plant superintendent and can coordinate all issues regarding the fuel oil either directly or indirectly.  (He happened to call today so he should be glad to hear from us)


Thanks,

Subject: RE: Responses to your questions on fuel oil for Fort Pierce facility

Mark -- 

(1)  We can use the MHI turbine specs that we have now.  The turbine team 
will be telling everyone that final specs (on everything in the turbine 
contract) will not be final for a while, so you have to use what is available 
now.  In reality, not much will actually change.  Just use their current oil 
spec sheet.

(2)  We have the opportunity to sell more than 200,00 gallons now, but we 
need a price to work the extra deal.  

(3)  If extra time for filling is desired (as in a put), then let me know the 
parameters, and I will try to get it agreed to.  Starting to fill on time is 
important, but if we take some extra time to finish, that might be okay.

(4)  Regarding the comment about not wanting too many trucks lined up and 
causing traffic congestion, there is room in two spots near the plant to 
"stage" a series of trucks.  If this info would be useful, let me know.

Subject: Responses to your questions on fuel oil for Fort Pierce facility



Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. 
King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions 
except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on 
the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether 
the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our 
quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the 
engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon 
order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and 
to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at 
x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?   

 The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?     

 The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than 
standard fittings?    

 Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees    

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from 
Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl 
the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and 
weekends?  

 Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on 
a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line 
of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the 
neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?  

 At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort 
Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that 
location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) 
after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating   

 The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant   

 Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on 
transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

  Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the 
issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers   

  Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)  

  We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you 
would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan     

  The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

  None that we are aware of.
