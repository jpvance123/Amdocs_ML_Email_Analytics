Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information I would 
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe

I am interested in obtaining a load breakdown by industrial, residential, and electrical
generator customers for your utility, on a monthly basis, as part of a NWPL market
research project. If you could give me some contact information, I would appreciate
the help.

I recently won two of your auctions. One is 5 posters, one is 18. I am excited
about these posters, but I have a couple questions. Are the 5 posters in the first
set completely included in the set of 18? If so, is it possible to get any non-duplicates
that you may own in the same theme that will not be doubled up in these sets?

Thanks for the product.
Jason

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

Sergei,
To avoid duplicates I would prefer to pay for only the 18 Big Stalin Russian Political 
Posters (1013259638).
Thank you very much for your understanding. I am transferring funds to Paypal now in the 
amount of:
$16.50 (item) + $27.50 (shipping) = $44.00 (total)

In 3-4 business days a Paypal transfer will be made to ezyroll@aol.com.

Is this shipping from overseas? If so, perhaps this should be insured. Let me know.
My address is:

JASON WOLFE

Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work e-mail. I'm
doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the market for
a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your quest for a
Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment, I
don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage. Tara and I
will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on throwing
back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and get as
accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go Cards!

Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

Thanks,
Jason Wolfe

the merger will be completed over the next 8-10 months, so who knows where I will
end up. I need to be where the trading is.
Beth and I are driving up for XMas. We're leaving Houston Thurs or Fri before, and will head back
for Houston the 26th. Let Sweetpea know.

I am corrected--thanks.  What do you think about Illinova??  Close to home,
lower cost of living, etc???  From what I understand they are just starting
to get into the energy marketing business.  They might like an ex-enron guy.

Dearest Trav, 
Saturday night was really special.  I've never had a five-way before, and it was surprisingly comfortable.  Thanks for setting up that TV for me to watch next to where the real action was going on.  Most guys wouldn't have done that for me.  You're a wonderful guy, and I'll be sure to invite you to all my upcoming multipartner fests.
Still sore, 
Matt 
PS. Please pass on my thanks and accolades to you're gorgeous bikini-clad girlie and that hot dog.

We are totally LBs. no DEs. We had a bad defensive game, which I hope turns around next week,
as we have good people at those positions. Our defense has been one of the best.
PumpnGD had a lucky defensive game, but
he has good people as well. Our head-to-head with him in 2 weeks is key. Curtis Martin
is a bye for him, so he picked up Watters. But you saw last night how dominant Shaun
Alexander is. If he has a good game next week, he may have the starting role or at
least split carries. 
The next 2 games will be tough.
Jason

I would be greatful if you could provide this as soon as possible.

You didn't answer if you would clean more or less boats this year than the last guy.

And yes, I am with Beth.

I don't clean boats damnit. I manufacture them from powder form

So Tara is definitely returning?

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job?
Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
your position in the history of Triumph Boats?

BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.

         Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
      e-mail.
         I'm
         doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
      market
         for
         a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
      quest
         for a
         Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of
   unemployment,
      I
         don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
      Tara
         and I
         will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan
   on
         throwing
         back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and
   Beth
         together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin
   and
      get
         as
         accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre.
   Go
         Cards!

         --Eric

That said, perhaps I can get more casual...
It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but
your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need 
some quality time.

Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me
a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat.

So, have we got a full room for tomorrow? 
I'll work out the details with Trav and get back to you guys about HALO on Thursday--we might want to use two locations and play online if we can be sure of our ability to do that.  Otherwise, we'll all meet in one place to oooh and aaaah over HALO and booze.

So Tara is definitely returning?

Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job? 
Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
your position in the history of Triumph Boats?

BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.

By Dec. 1 or Dec. 31, I forget. Her start date is Aug. 5th. I could give you
a raw water washdown, but I'd have to charge you $185.

      Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
   e-mail.
      I'm
      doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
   market
      for
      a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
   quest
      for a
      Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment,
   I
      don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
   Tara
      and I
      will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
      throwing
      back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
      together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and
   get
      as
      accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go
      Cards!

The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending.
If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.

But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like
myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are 
immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted). 
Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to:
2300 W Alabama  Apt 6
Houston, TX 77098

Thanks,
Jason

Jim,

I was wondering if you could provide any info on the Deer Island meter off NWPL (470)? It is a fair amount
of load in the area, and I was just curious if this was mostly residential, or if there is a plant I am unaware of.
I appreciate whatever help you can provide.
Thanks,

Keith,
I am trying to confirm that the following plants receive gas off of these
respective meters on NWPL:

Ferndale, WA plant (reduced capacity) -  meter 472
Wematchee, WA plant (closed) - 446
Longview, WA plant (closed) - 227
Troutdale, OR plant (closed) - 302

Could you confirm that the Troutdale plant is a direct connect and does not
nominate through the Cascade LDC?
This may be best answered by whomever schedules your supply.

Also, it would be extremely helpful if you could tell me when the
above plants closed or reduced capacity.

I appreciate any help you can give me.
Thanks,

Ms. Ridinger:

I am an analyst studying industrial gas load in the northwestern United
States
and am attempting to place a number of aluminum plants. I believe I have
the
Northwest Pipeline DRN numbers for 3 of your 4 plants, but am not sure
which meter feeds your Ferndale, WA plant. Also, I would like to confirm
the DRNs
for the other three.
If you, or someone you could refer me to, could provide this information
I would
greatly appreciate it.

The Index settles during bid week for the following month (last week of Sep for Oct) and is
published around this time. This curve is probably in the system as basis, code D, which is the
difference between the Index and NYMEX settle. This index is the Oct price curve (P) plus the Oct 
basis curve (D). Deals are +/- a few cents for 
The index (I) curve is next month's curve at what these differentials are trading at. It is not the actual
"index". It is what is added to the index for physical deals priced off index.
I know it is confusing.

I'm confused. The gas daily prices is ok.
Question on index curves. What index curves do you need?

	a. the curves from egs_curves that are inserted into the
	   database everyday because the prices are different everyday.
	   risk type code = 'I' and curve_type_cd = 'PR'.

	b. the curves from the pub posting that are inserted into
	    the database once a month. These are the settle price curves.
	    risk type code = 'D' and curve_type_cd = 'SP'

That's fine. The Index curves we are most concerned with (the current month), will be set in the next day
or so and will not change for the duration of the month. Next month's index curves can be loaded whenever.

Jason,

	The Gas Daily Curves are loaded into the system everyday at 6AM
	or something when they have problems, the curves are loaded at
	around 11AM. I can get these curves as soon as they get it.
	However, Index curves are loaded by GGREENA, CFRANK2, and CRABON
	at around 3PM or 4PM. I will not be able to get these curves.
	I can get Yesterdays Index curves.

I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get mad, I could put
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full.
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we go.

I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little bit of security. 
I need something.

criticisms. 
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin. 
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite 
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common 
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a 
pact 
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave 
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul. 
Love, 
Jason 
P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me, 
and vice versa.

The zone and UNA meter exist in sitara already. Two of the five meters that will be assigned 
by schedulers need to be set up. As it is, the zone is mapped to Socal curves -
but should be PG&E as you said below.

   a
   bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an
   offer
   from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the

   who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company

The game was nail-bitingly close, but Chinese 12 year old hookah's strategy of
ChoKoNu mayhem was the deciding factor.
At one point, Beth and I soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
(and rear-action monk cowards), but it was Alan's resource control that won out.
But for the most part, I would characterize the game as a draw.
Bring on the firstperson shooters until Star Wars.

Tis' true I did kick the game over in my head a bit last night, but alas I found calm in the words of jim rome "SCOREBOARD!". 
The team of zero tolerance, black jesus, and matt (couldn't really tell if he was playing never saw his army) was thoroughly trounced yet again. 12 yr old hooka and I were merciful however and accepted the early surrender of the brow-beaten losers.
Here's to hoping a bit of smack talk can bring forth a better effort next round :)

Let's gauge the interest in a first-person shooter: 
Through Allan, we have several at our disposal, and if we want to own them, there are a ton of great ones available at sub-basement prices.  However, let's try before we buy (if you haven't already).  Current options include Rogue Spear (very realistic and detailed), Quake (fragtastic), and Tribes (all about teamwork).  There are others, too, but these were the ones Allan and I were chatting about.
You folks wanna try this?

PS. Allan said he was awake all night thinking about how close we came to slaughtering him..or something to that affect.

1) you WILL be attending"Art"
2) you may remove and re-don pants at your leisure during the show, but you
WILL arrive and leave suitably dressed.
3) AoE should be ON tonight, or some acceptable replacement strategy/shooter

If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from Devil-Pooch made me
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle.
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought):
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build stone walls,
	encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. And to seal us off.
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as his army is killed.
	Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources until the point
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army is concentrated 
and huge.
3) Build castles on conquered territory.

If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as soon as we each have a
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of trebuchets is imperative.
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill.
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not attacking,
it's over.

If any of you are available for some strategy practices tonight...choose what civ's we'll play and practice leveraging their strengths against an enemy.  We have failed to play like a team in every battle yet, we must improve our solidarity as a fighting force.  I think that means setting team members' priorities for army segments.
Ex: Beth goes Byzantine and provides us with some walls and infantry, I gor Briton and provide archers and siege weapons, Jay goes nuts with knights and monks. We attack one base eliminating hostile towers and units, and then allow the siege weapons to level the buildings with archer and monk support.  Knights at perimeter to protect army while we finish the job and beth building some protective walls to add to the trouble the enemy must go throught o attack us while we FINISH OFF every base.
I also suspect that twot hings have really added to allan's victories. 
1) Walls everywhere.  We have to knock the m down to get to him and he'll always know about it. 
2) Guard shacks every where.  He always sees where we are.  We never know where he is. 
So, who can play with me tonight?  My place?  Your place?  Office?

Well, go find Glen Cook's The Black Company to start a less deep, but still entertaining, series.

I forgot to tell you how mad I was as I got into the book that I am reading. You wouldn't believe how much Goodkind has ripped off from Jordan. I actually got out of bed to check the publishing dates on the books. 80% of Jordan's work was published up to 4 years before Goodkind. 80% of his ideas are ripped off by Goodkind. You would think that I would be so disgusted that I would boycott Goodkind. Unfortunately, my irritation does not reach that far. It is like finishing up a bowl of BlueBell Ice Cream, wanting another but having no more Bluebell and so settling for the marshmallow imitation generic grocery brand - empty calories that are not nearly as satisfying. I am so weak...

I'm eating Droubi's middle eastern cuisine right now, thinking of the times

So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we
are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

Subject:	Petition to the United Nations against subhuman treatment of wome	n in Afghanistan


If you decide not to forward this,  please send it back 
to Darleene Barrientos [darleeneah@earthlink.net ]. This is  an actual 
petition, and "signatures" 
will be lost if you drop the  line. 
  
  
Please take 3 minutes out of  your life to do your 
part. And be sure to include other members of your  
household who are willing to sign. 
Petition to the United Nations  Background Information: 
Madhu, the government of  Afghanistan, is waging a war 
upon women. Since the Taliban took power in  1996, 
women have had to wear burqua and have been 
beaten and stoned in  public for not having the proper 
attire, even if this means simply not  having the mesh 
covering in front of their eyes. One woman 
was beaten  to death by an angry mob of fundamentalists 
for accidentally exposing her  arm(!) while she was 
driving. Another was stoned to death for 
trying  to leave the country with a man that was not a 
relative. 
Women are not allowed to work  or even go out in public 
without a male relative; professional women such  as 
professors, translators, doctors, lawyers, artists and 
writers have  been forced from their jobs and 
restricted to their homes. Homes where a  woman is 
present must have their windows painted so that she 
can never  be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent 
shoes so that they are never  heard. Women live in fear 
of their lives for the slightest misbehavior.  Because 
they cannot work, those without male 
relatives or husbands are  either starving to death or 
begging in the street, even if they hold  Ph.D.'s. 
Depression is becoming so widespread that it has 
reached  emergency 
levels. There is no way in such an extreme Islamic 
society  to know the suicide rate with certainty, but 
relief workers are estimating  that the suicide rate 
among women must be 
extraordinarily high: those  who cannot find proper 
medication and treatment for severe depression and  
would rather take their lives than live in such 
conditions. At one of  the rare hospitals for women, a 
reporter found still, nearly lifeless  bodies 
lying motionless on top of beds, wrapped in their 
burqua,  unwilling to speak, eat, or do anything, but 
slowly wasting away. Others  have gone mad and were 
seen crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or  
crying, most of them in fear. 
It is at the point where the  term "human rights 
violations" has become an understatement. Husbands  
have the power of life and death over their women 
relatives,  especially their wives, but an angry 
mob has just as much right to stone  or beat a woman, 
often to death, for exposing an inch of flesh or  
offending them in the slightest way. Women 
enjoyed relative freedom:  to work, to dress generally 
as they wanted, and to drive and appear in  public 
alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this 
transition is the  main reason for the depression and 
suicide; Women who were once educators  or doctors or 
simply used to basic human freedoms are now 
severely  restricted and treated as subhuman in the 
name of right-wing  fundamentalist Islam. It is not 
their tradition or 'culture', but it is  
alien to them, and it is extreme even for those 
cultures where  fundamentalism is the rule. Everyone 
has a right to a tolerable human  
existence, even if they are women in a Muslim country. 
If we can threaten military  force in Kosovo the name 
of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians,  
citizens of the world can certainly express 
peaceful outrage at the  oppression, murder and 
injustice committed against women by the Taliban.  
STATEMENT: In signing this, we  agree that the current 
treatment of women in Afghanistan is completely  
UNACCEPTABLE and deserves action by the 
United Nations and that the  current situation overseas 
will not be tolerated. 
Women's Rights is not a small issue  anywhere, and it 
is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 2001 to be treated as  
subhuman and as so much property. Equality 
and human decency is a  fundamental RIGHT, not a 
freedom to be granted, whether one lives in  Afghanistan 
or elsewhere.

I look forward to an evening of intense concentration puncuated by controlling, berating direction. 
And that's just Beth's backseat driving on the way to Greenway. 
Hey-oh!
But seriously, folks, I'm probably not in for any game night where Travis is encouraging guys to feel his lance.
Isn't there enough posturing?

I am interested in Cascade's natural gas demand by broad customer class - such as residential, industrial, and electric
generation - over the past year. Also, if possible, a list of the larger generators or industrials that you serve. 

Could you direct me to the department or individual who could best assist me in this research?

Patti, Stacey,

The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
Zone: Las Vegas
Facility: UNA - Las Vegas

It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
Harry Allen (2-4015)
Apex (2-4002)
Blue Diamond (2-4016)
Pecos (2-4013)
Lone Mountain (2-4012)

Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.

The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.

Let me know what you think.
Thanks,
Jason

According to CNBC, the Dynegy deal is close, with an announcement today.
I'm not really nervous; Enron's strength is its wholesale trading dept. 
I'm not sure about non-core business and corporate hacks, though.
We'll see how it all shakes out - it's really hard to believe it has come to this.

So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we

I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your criticisms.
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin.
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a pact
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul.
Love,
Jason

P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me,
and vice versa.

I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get 
mad, I could put 
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like 
enough of a princess to 
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway 
of however many 
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would 
really show how much 
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me. 
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full. 
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we 
go. 
And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for

   I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you 
   don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the 
   situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, 
   complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken 
   care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a 
   partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and 
   establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would 
   be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would 
   like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. 
   Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little 
   bit of security. 
   I need something. 
   I need to stop fighting with you and do something with my life.

   I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your

   By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin. 
   Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite 
   our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
   Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of 
   common 
   interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke 
   a 
   pact 
   to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave 
   Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul.

   P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me,

I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs
for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston.
It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,
swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into
it, and travel a long way to go.
Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy look
at it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.

Love,
Jason

Hi Jason,
We don't hear much from you these days.
 Did you watch the Cowboys game yesterday? I didn't know that Wright was
out.
 We bought a digital camera Fri. so we're going to Jill's when she gets off
work to take some pictures of Mikayl. I'll also make sure we take some
pictures of him in his Halloween costume. I took a day off today. the
weather has been really nice. I took some good pictures of Dad on his
motorcycle.
 Better go and get ready to go to Jill's.

Enron
Enron  is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications  companies. The company, which owns approximately $37 billion in energy and  communications assets, produces electricity and natural gas, delivers physical  commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the  world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online  business - EnronOnline. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com << File: http://www.enron.com/ >> . The stock is traded under the  ticker symbol "ENE".
 
 
Is this correct? I thought Enron didn't produce  electricity...or natural gas....just transported it....

I'm up on all that. I was on my way to Portland, so couldn't pick up Canidate. However, it looks
like Faulk only has bruised bone and will be back in 1-2 weeks.
Shaun Alexander was the big miss, that guy could be a stud.
We won again, and are 4th in the league with a good shot to win our next 2.
Surprising, considering how shitty Thrash has become. 

I will be back from Portland Wed night so I will probably see you at some point.

If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we are owned by Dynegy.
Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.

If Beth OKs it I can do a strategy session. That last email from 
Devil-Pooch made me 
yearn for the sight of his blood soiling the field of battle. 
The key to Allan's wins (and I have given it some thought): 
1) Quick advancement. He doesn't attack early, I believe it is to build 
stone walls, 
        encompassing a larger area than is proportional for his team. 
And to seal us off. 
2) Large level of resources, enabling him to cue Paladins to build as 
his army is killed. 
        Thus he has a constant wave of attacks. He also builds resources 
until the point 
he decides to attack, then he kills all but maybe 20 villagers. His army 
is concentrated 
and huge. 
3) Build castles on conquered territory. 
If we wall a large area, build resource levels quickly, then attack as 
soon as we each have a 
40 man army, with additional soldiers cued. we will win. The use of 
trebuchets is imperative. 
We should have a total of 10 on our team. Towers kill. 
AND WE MUST NEVER SIT BACK AND LET HIM REBUILD. Whenever we hang out not 
attacking, 
it's over.

Thanks. My battery cap looked a little different. I will try to take it off tonight and will take a picture.
It wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked (it wasn't nearly as clean around the
battery as grandmas). Hopefully no more problems.

Here's 3 pictures as I see Grandma's car.
One with the hot battery terminal cap on.
One with the hot battery terminal cap off.
One showing where the hot cable from your battery connects to your starter.
Hope they help.

Dipak,
Seattle/Tacoma is the summation of a large number of meters.
The largest residential loads are broken out separately as tabs.
The temps are from the research/weather folder.
Initially, I am just curious if you can achieve a decent correlation.
We can refine things a bit later.

So Camas Jr is confirmed paper mill?
Do you know what is behind the Bellingham II point (290)?
Bellingham/Ferndale (472) I understand is the Ferndale power plant; is this 290 point
another unit?

Dave,

What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.

Thanks,
Jason

My Romantic Horoscope for Today:
 
The pieces of a two-piece puzzle just don't seem to want to fit together. You've tried countless angles, jerry-riggings and creative solutions, but you keep coming up short. Perhaps the answer, then, is to work with the flaws between the pieces as well as the pieces themselves.

Mr. Boehlke:

After speaking to a NW Natural representative, I was told to contact you for more
specifics regarding information on your customer breakdown. 
I am interested in gas load by residential, industrial, and electrical generation on a weekly
or monthly basis. Your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly
similar format, but I was hoping I could get more specific numbers, including the type
of industrial user (high-tech, aluminum, agricultural, etc.) and historicals back to last
winter. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it, as trying to forecast NWPL
load without some general NW Natural data is impossible.

Thanks,
