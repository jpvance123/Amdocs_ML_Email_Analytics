I just wanted to confirm that the ability to create roll ups without the IT 
group's involvement has been moved up
on the priority list.

I had called but you were out.

Zhiyong had ask me to look into the GTV Live feed projects (see below).
I have seen the Curve manager spreadsheet.  I would like you to point me
in the right direction by:
	- telling me who are the traders who are requesting this changes.
	- can I get a copy of spreadsheets that they want the live feed on?
	- how many spreadsheets are we changing?
	- etc...

Issue 4:  Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves

?	Develop live feed capability for intra-month curves just like we have for basis, etc.
Once this capability is complete, traders will have to set new curves.  We expect the curves to be set as follows:  The Henry Hub intra-month curve will be tied to the NYMEX feed.  Most (if not all) other curves will be tied to the Henry Hub intra-month curve in some way.  Traders will have to set differentials.

Developing the live feed capability for intra-month curves is feasible, and the development timeline from the IT group is 3 weeks (see project timeline).

There is one more addition to the Meeting Notes from last week.  I overlooked 
the very important live feed for Gas Daily/intra-month curves, so the revised 
file below adds this as Issue #2a.

Also, regarding our next meeting:  Normally I'd like to hold our weekly 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however, I will not be here this Wednesday 
and Thursday.   So, please mark your calendars for a meeting on Tuesday, 
March 13 at 11:30 am in EB3270 to review progress, discuss the Gas Daily 
issues and address any questions on direction, priorities, etc.   Please let 
me know if you cannot attend.

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

My name is Ramesh Rao and I work for Beth Perlman in Net Works.  Based on the email below, I'd like to get with each of you to discuss the FY 02 budget for my team and get your feedback.  As a first step, I will set up a meeting or a conference call with each of you shortly.   

My team supports the mid-back office for Gas and Power i.e. Unify, DCAF 2, TAGG Confirmations and EnPower Confirmations.  Unify is used by Gas for Logistics, Vol. Management, and Settlements.  It is used by Power for Settlements.  Unify also supports Financial Gas and Power, which is used in Houston, Calgary and London.  Confirmations are handled by DCAF 2, TAGG Confirmations or EnPower Confirmations as the case may be.

Since your teams use one or all of these applications, you share the costs.  I can meet with each of you (or your representative) individually or meet with everyone as a group.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thanks,

Ramesh

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise

Colleen/Geoff -

Only other issue I can think of, is making sure that deals with "I" risk do 
not show up in V@R calculation (Only deals with M gas daily risk should be 
downloaded into risktrac for V@R).

Subject: Gas Daily Issue

Geoff visited with me this morning regarding the Gas Daily Issue and I 
attempted to summarize this in the attached document.  If you get a chance 
before tomorrow's meeting, could you review this and see if I missed any 
major pieces?  (Just look at the First Tab that says Gas Daily, the TDS tab 
is nothing at this point.)  Geoff said he had talked this through with you so 
I thought you may recognize if I missed anything or misunderstood it.  (I 
also left a copy of it on his desk.)  Thanks.

I had called but you were out.

Zhiyong had ask me to look into the GTV Live feed projects (see below).
I have seen the Curve manager spreadsheet.  I would like you to point me
in the right direction by:
 - telling me who are the traders who are requesting this changes.
 - can I get a copy of spreadsheets that they want the live feed on?
 - how many spreadsheets are we changing?
 - etc...

Issue 4:  Live feeds for Gas Daily/intra-month curves

? Develop live feed capability for intra-month curves just like we have for 
basis, etc.
Once this capability is complete, traders will have to set new curves.  We 
expect the curves to be set as follows:  The Henry Hub intra-month curve will 
be tied to the NYMEX feed.  Most (if not all) other curves will be tied to 
the Henry Hub intra-month curve in some way.  Traders will have to set 
differentials.

Developing the live feed capability for intra-month curves is feasible, and 
the development timeline from the IT group is 3 weeks (see project 
timeline).

Geoff,

 Attached is yesterdays NG curves that goes out more than
14 years. Is the curve that you talked to me about yesterday?
If it is, this curve was entered by Dutch Quigley using curveload.


Francis



NOTES ONLY:
the curves were generated using the query below:

 select ref_period_dt,curve_amt
 from egs_curves
 where effective_dt = '26-mar-01'
 and curve_cd = 'NG'
 and curve_type_cd = 'PR'
 order by ref_period_dt

Subject: RE: GTV II  

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please 
sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the 
final signed copy to everyone.

On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress 
reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these 
will all be early deliveries!).  

Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II 
by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this.

All looks great so far.

Any problems - just give me a ring.

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the 
analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the 
IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any 
divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - 
I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit 
down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

Zhiyong -

I have looked over the consolidated gas system inception document.  Here are a few questions/observations:

1.  Value all physical deals.  Not just current month.  This will require logistics to enter all forward transport rather than just current month.  (This is not an issue,  just needs to be addressed as we go)

2.  Term transport in new physical system would require spread option model to be in place.  

3.  Storey -  Would all term transportation be a spread option and we would set the correlations to one if there was no optionality?

4.  CPR is currently used as a back up if Sitara goes down.  What would we do if the new system goes down?

5.  What is the functionality to downstream systems going to look like?  (Risktrac - V@R, credit)

6.  Will calculations be performed from the same new system as Global Markets?

7.  What will happen if:  There is a fixed price physical deal where the risk components are split? 

Example: Price : NG-PRICE		Basis: FT-WEST		Index: INTRA-WEST

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

Louise and Geoff,

Please find the attached file for the latest Statement Of Work for the Consolidated Gas System project. I have only revised the Estimated Costs section to match the final budget for the project next year. The preliminary work done this year will be charged to some existing projects. This is the Statement Of Work for the phase 1 (physical) of the project. The Statement Of Work of the phase 2 (financial) will be delivered in a few weeks. Please review the document. I would like to request your signature some time next week.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Criteria to filter deals. In other words, individual field names that are used to filter deals and features with those fields.
Do you want to see daily position beyond the next day?
How do we handle Gas Daily deals?

Thanks for getting me the signed (so far) copy.  (Beth and Philippe, please sign the document today ).  When they have signed please recirculate the final signed copy to everyone.

On a going forward basis, please ensure that we receive weekly progress reports including any variances to timeline deliverables (hopefully these will all be early deliveries!).  

Secondly, please could you deliver the Inception Document for GTVII Phase II by Friday April 6th.  I believe Geof is ready to sit down with you on this.

All looks great so far.

Any problems - just give me a ring.

Thanks

Louise,

Thank you for your suggestion. I agree that it is critical for us to get feedbacks from Geof as early as possible. For instance, Geof suggested some changes to the design last Friday. The suggestion requires some re-work on the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process.

I love to have the team meet Geof daily. I will check with Geof for his availability.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

Geoff:  I understand that I need to get with you to approve the portion of my budget that is allocated the Enron America's.  Currently  $  299,871 is budgeted for allocation to EA.  My group coordinates JV activities as well as conducting due diligence on IT areas related to aquisitions and divestitures.  The amount budgeted above is for the following known projects:

		Coordination and Operations under the Bridgeline IT Services Agreement
		Due Diligence related to Project Sugarcane and how we may monetize our investment in Bridgeline

In 2002 ENA will bill Bridgeline $1,250,000 for IT Services.  Since Chevron/Texaco covers 60% of the bill ENA will net $750,000 in revenue for the services coordinated by my group.  

Let me know if you'd like to get together and discuss this in any detail.

Tommy Yanowski  x36858.

TDSDealTicker
? The Sitara deal Id will show for non EOL deals entered into Sitara

TDS Position Manager
? Groups of groups are supported when defining curve groupings.
? New filters have been added to the Position Manager to allow viewing the 
positions associated with "Changed" & "New & Changed" Positions. When looking 
at the positions with the changed filter set, the net change in the position 
from the official PortCalc is reported.
? When viewing "New" or "All" deals in the Position Manager right-clicking 
the mouse over a position for a specific period provides a menu option to 
view the deals behind that position.  This feature is not available when 
viewing a roll-up desk (i.e. ALL-WEST, ALL-EAST, etc.)

Louise,

attached is a plan for the roll-out of Windows 2000 for the trading groups for which TIBCO 6.x has been scripted.

 
Richard Burchfield and I are currently investigating the state of TIBCO 5.x on the Windows NT 4.0 plaftorm that is still being used, and will get back to you when we have determined if the TIBCO 6.x solution can be incorprated into a script before the actual roll-out of Win2k.

regards

Steve

I'm a bit confused - I think that the current document distributed for circulation is too small.  I would suggest this be abandonned and a next draft produced which includes the following.

Single Deal entry revisions
Options reports
Transport Valuation in ERMS
EOL reporting tools (possible)

I would like to see Phase II include the items above and an Inception document re-issued this week.

Thanks

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Louise,

I have just sent you the revised Inception Document including three additional items: Single deal entry revisions, Options reports, and Transport valuation in ERMS. After discussing with Geof, we decided not to include the EOL reporting tools this time. Hopefully, you are OK with that. Please let us know if the EOL reporting tools have to be discussed in the document.

Regards.

Geoff and Chuck,

I have submitted an e-request for each of you to have access to the TDS Parallel environment.
Once this is complete, one of us will help you create a shortcut on your PC desktop to run it.
You should not need any additional access; you will use your existing TDS production id and password.

Thanks, d.n.

Geoff,

=09The weekly status meeting with the IT guys took place as scheduled on Mo=
nday afternoon.  The main issues are as follows:

Dave would like to sit down and discuss the requirements for the customizab=
le time periods on the pos manager.
Reaffirmation of taking all the components in Phase I into production by th=
e middle of the month.
Roll up aggregation for curve shift as well as position
FX Price column in the positions as well as group of groups requirements,

The issues that they are currently facing is the FX Price column in the pos=
itions as well as group of groups requirements.  I think they would like to=
 sit down with you and discuss on Monday to get a better sense of the exact=
 requirements.  I'm not entirely sure as to what the question is on the FX =
column, but they said they'd like to speak with you on Monday either way. =
=20

As far as my own work is concerned, I loaded the GDI curves for the Central=
 and West desks on Monday.  However, I still need to create a process where=
by that is done directly.  Ahmad is working on developing the capabilities =
in the current sheets for you, Andy and Martin.  In the meantime, we can ju=
st listen to the current index curves being published and just use those to=
 load into ERMS.  I still do not have access in ERMS test environment but I=
 hope to have that by tomorrow.  It seems like they finally got around to f=
ixing the TDS ticker in parallel.  I do have a few questions for you, howev=
er.  First, is there any need to see deals done for the current day in the =
deal ticker?  I assume you should as a way to see your daily physical trade=
s and the effect on the inherent position for that day and beyond.  Also, t=
here is some issue with the deal valuation in the position manager.  I'm tr=
ying to figure out exactly what Nayan is pulling out to value the physical =
positions.  The question is moot, however, once we have the live feeds in p=
lace for the physicals and gas daily's.  The IM positions have been moved o=
ut of the positions tab in the manager.  Mike has made some changes to valu=
e options in the deal ticker which was rolled out late this afternoon.  Thi=
s has not yet been tested.  I have to get access to all the books in parall=
el, but will get it in the morning.  We are having problems with calc'ing c=
urrent+prompt for the physical positions into TDS.  I'll be contacting Jere=
my Wong in the morning and ask him about the port calc errors.  We also sti=
ll have to test the GDI calcs in ERMS test.  Russ is still testing the TDS =
tradeblotter in test.  I will also continue in reconciling the physical sit=
ara positions with the TDS load.  As you can see, theres plenty of work to =
go around.  I apologize for the rambling nature of this email, but it is cu=
rrently approaching 11 pm and we are still working to correctly pull positi=
ons into the morning packet.  I'll send a much more coherent and concise re=
sponse tomorrow.  Talk to you soon.  Hope the wife and baby are doing well.

Chuck

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

Geof,

Please review the meeting notes for the requirements of GTV II phase 2 in the attached file. Please let me know any discrepancy and changes you want me to make.

The volatility skew data is stored in one of ERMS' database table. The skew data is currently maintained by John Griffith. We have a user interface built in Excel for down-loading and up-loading skew data. I think John has not started using the interface yet.

The testing for the volatility skew implementation has been done by john by calling IT for running the portcalc against production database. We will put the changes out in the test environment so that Chuck can also check it out. I will let Chuck know once it is available for him, hopefully, sometime today.

Thanks

Zhiyong

My name is Joe Wong and I work for Beth Perlman in Networks.  I have been asked to meet with you to review my portion of the 2002 IT budgets for gas & power.  I will set up a meeting or conf. call with each of you shortly.

My IT group supports the Global Data, Livelink, and intranet development for most of Enron.  Global data contains all counterparties, contracts, and facilities data.  Livelink is used to electronically store documents such as legal contracts, counterparty confirmations, etc... for all of Enron.  

Since these systems are used by all of you, you all share in the costs.  Thus, I must meet with all of you.  An alternative is for me to meet with 1 of you, who can represent everyone else.  If you chose the latter (which I prefer), please let me know who the contact is.  Thanks.

Subject:	New Start

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas 
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise

Subject:	RE: GTV II   

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

I understand we have now finalized 90% requirements on the GTV II.

Please could we pull together the format inception document this week for signature on your meeting next week with Geof and Colleen.

Document to include all requirements, dependencies and timelines.

I would suggest whoever is writing this spend some time with Geof this week.

Please circulate to draft all listed above including me.

Thanks,

Louise

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

The attached file will help anyone interested in which books make up a roll up, and which desk is not allowing the
total position to aggregate due to inconsistent dates.

The file contains a new utility that shows the desks that are included in the roll ups, with the official 
trade dates for all the desks.   

Please save the file to your local directory.

I didn't see the live-update of Gas Daily curves in your meeting notes. 
Should we add it? Please advise.

Thanks

Subject: REVISED MEETING NOTES

Please see the attached revision to the meeting notes.  You will see the 
change indicated in RED under Issue #2, Gas Daily.  We want to put this item 
on HOLD for now because there are more implications to this change that we 
need to resolve before coding begins.  The focus for now should be on putting 
physical positions in TDS--identifying all issues associated with it, resolve 
questions on where/how to get the position data, what should be filtered, 
design of the new screens, etc.  

Also, for your information--from now on we will be including Jeff Gossett and 
Russ Severson in our weekly meetings as I believe they can help tremendously 
with position reporting and how we currently get information from Sitara, 
CPR, ERMS & TAGG.  I will send you all an e-mail on Monday letting you know 
the time and place of next week's meeting.  Normally I want to hold the 
meetings on Wednesday afternoons; however--next week I may have to move it to 
Tuesday.  I will let you know first thing Monday morning.  Let me know if you 
have any questions or concerns.

Subject:	RE: Consolidated Gas System Document


Zhiyong -

I have looked over the consolidated gas system inception document.  Here are a few questions/observations:

1.  Value all physical deals.  Not just current month.  This will require logistics to enter all forward transport rather than just current month.  (This is not an issue,  just needs to be addressed as we go)

2.  Term transport in new physical system would require spread option model to be in place.  

3.  Storey -  Would all term transportation be a spread option and we would set the correlations to one if there was no optionality?

4.  CPR is currently used as a back up if Sitara goes down.  What would we do if the new system goes down?

5.  What is the functionality to downstream systems going to look like?  (Risktrac - V@R, credit)

6.  Will calculations be performed from the same new system as Global Markets?

7.  What will happen if:  There is a fixed price physical deal where the risk components are split? 

Example: Price : NG-PRICE		Basis: FT-WEST		Index: INTRA-WEST

For the detailed requirements I need to talk to both of you. Let's have a meeting to talk about the correct valuation for all physical deals including storage and transport. I will schedule it. I was going to schedule the meeting for the detailed requirements after the State Of Work is signed.

Thanks

Zhiyong

Zhiyong -

I have looked over the consolidated gas system inception document.  Here are a few questions/observations:

1.  Value all physical deals.  Not just current month.  This will require logistics to enter all forward transport rather than just current month.  (This is not an issue,  just needs to be addressed as we go)

2.  Term transport in new physical system would require spread option model to be in place.  

3.  Storey -  Would all term transportation be a spread option and we would set the correlations to one if there was no optionality?

4.  CPR is currently used as a back up if Sitara goes down.  What would we do if the new system goes down?

5.  What is the functionality to downstream systems going to look like?  (Risktrac - V@R, credit)

6.  Will calculations be performed from the same new system as Global Markets?

7.  What will happen if:  There is a fixed price physical deal where the risk components are split? 

Example: Price : NG-PRICE		Basis: FT-WEST		Index: INTRA-WEST

Louise,

Thank you for your suggestion. I agree that it is critical for us to get 
feedbacks from Geof as early as possible. For instance, Geof suggested some 
changes to the design last Friday. The suggestion requires some re-work on 
the user interface and some changes in the daily risk management process.

I love to have the team meet Geof daily. I will check with Geof for his 
availability.

Thanks

Zhiyong

I think we need to get a lot closer together - I expect Geoff (and the 
analyst working for Geoff on this) to be spending a lot more time down on the 
IT floors.  If we integrate at a much earlier stage we might not see any 
divergence from how Geoff sees the end result to what actually appears.

Could you consider how to get your team spending much more time with Geoff - 
I would suggest you have a daily time when you all (developers included) sit 
down around a desk to look at progress.

Let me know what you think?

Louise

Geoff,

Listing of current issues

Resaving and publishing of April 30th IM curves to show June values.  The portcalc's were bombing out because there was no prior June value in the curves.  So as of May 1, they started bombing.  I have to find a way to re-post prior day curves out into ERMS.  

All the GDI curve manager files that are pulling the physical index curves should be ready by tonight.  I'm doing Texas as I write.  I think we should leave the issue of who and how these curves are set up to the individual desks.  For the central desk, we can use the term traders files to publish.  But, we could also set aside a separate file to merely listen to the phys idx curves and publish them that way.  I'm going to release the files to the desks for them to review and get back to me for changes and revisions.  

The changes made into TDS deal evaluation are being revised today.  I guess there were some problems this morning and are now being fixed.

As for the position manager, there is an issue as to how we would like the New/ Changed/ New & Changed filter placed onto the position manager.  The issue there is that with the FX column in the positions tab, what should that positions tab look to as a filter if we place that function on the positions and cash tab.  Dave has suggested putting the filter in the menu area where you can manipulate it and then tab between columns.  I agreed that that was the best solution but I figure you should probably let me know ASAP whether you agree.

Other than that I don't know what else is new or important to add.  After I'm done calcing tonight I'll go ahead and publish the GDI curves myself.  Tomorrow morning I'll talk with the Risk leads and ask them if they can review and load the curves from here on out.  I'll also start modifying the curve files to include an additional month so we wont run into that problem again.  That should be done for EOD tomorrow.  Give me a call if you have any questions and/or problems.

Chuck

	Also Hunter wants to be able to classify the counterparties according to Industry type (i.e. producers, utility, pulp/paper, auto)
	Does that information exist in global counterparties database, SIC codes maybe?

	I want a document by wednesday next week.

Comments:

Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out 
dates.
Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction 
required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted 
and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the 
timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the 
organiztion).

There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be 
utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is 
completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done 
in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.

Please re-issue today.

Louise

Document to include all requirements, dependencies and timelines.

I would suggest whoever is writing this spend some time with Geof this week.

Please circulate to draft all listed above including me.

Thanks,

Louise

Geoff and Chuck,

I have submitted an e-request for each of you to have access to the TDS 
Parallel environment.
Once this is complete, one of us will help you create a shortcut on your PC 
desktop to run it.
You should not need any additional access; you will use your existing TDS 
production id and password.

Thanks, d.n.
