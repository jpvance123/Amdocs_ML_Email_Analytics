Ken Lay will be traveling to Japan - departing Guadalajara, Mexico on October 
29, arriving late October 30.  He will be available for meetings on October 
31 and November 1.  He can stay over for a time on November 2 and all day if 
necessary, but he is trying to get back to Columbia, Missouri for a dinner on 
the evening of November 3, so would be good if he could depart by noon on 
November 2.  

Hope this allows time for all the meetings and the office opening.  I look 
forward to receiving more information.

Ken Lay Visit. Following discussions with the Prime Minister's office and a 
quick check with venues 31 October is firming up as the preferred date for a 
meeting with the Prime Minister and an office opening by the PM. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The Nikkei and the Tokyo University have now made the 
decision to invite Mr Skilling to give the key note address at the symposium 
on 26 November in Tokyo. As mentioned, the symposium is the most prestigious 
conference on IT in Japan.

While the conference itself receives significant media attention, the 
President of Nikkei has offered to interview Mr Skilling. This honour is 
usually reserved for Heads of State. The interview will be featured on the 
front page of the Nikkei and picked up by other major media services.

kind regards

Subject: Re: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister  

Ken Lay Visit. Balancing the need to push out the arrangement of high level 
meetings as far as possible with the desire to have a meeting with Prime 
Minister Mori prior to the US Presidential election, the week commencing 30 
October would be the optimum time for a visit by Mr Lay. PM Mori is generally 
available in that week. We will get a preferred time from the PM's chief 
secretary first thing tomorrow morning Tokyo time. 

Jeff Skilling Visit. The boards of Nikkei and Tokyo University Institute of 
Advanced Studies have yet to make a decision on the key note speaker for the 
one day invitation only seminar to be held on 26 October. As mentioned, the 
boards will choose between the chairman of Cisco and Jeff Skilling. The 
conference is focused on the IT revolution and an invitation only event for 
approximately 600 of Japan's corporate leaders.

The speaking panel and topics for discussion will be developed around the key 
note speaker. If Mr Skilling were to give the key note speech, it is likely 
that key senior Government Ministers would be asked to present at the 
seminar. 

Following the Prime Minister's commitment at the Okinawa summit of 
US$15billion expenditure in the region on IT infrastructure and education, 
Japan's focus on e-commerce is almost reaching fever pitch. There will be 
significant interest in the conference from senior levels of Government and 
the business community. Further, as you would expect with the involvement of 
the Nikkei, there is typically significant media coverage associated with the 
key note speaker's presentation.

kind regards

Dear Steve,

Please find enclosed a note on the results of the Upper House election held here in Japan on July 29. 

In a nutshell, there were no real surprises. The ruling coalition achieved a comfortable majority of 12 seats, for a total of 136 seats, in the 247 seat chamber. 

I'd be happy to put together a more detailed analysis if needed.

Yours,

Subject: Ken Lay meeting with Japanese Prime Minister

Steve,

Over the last month the Japanese regulators and Government have come to the 
realization that the electricity deregulation initiatives implemented in 
March of this year have not stimulated competition in the manner in which 
they had expected. MITI and the Government are currently examining why the 
initiatives implemented in March are falling short of expectations and 
looking to move the 2003 review forward to next year. There are currently two 
multi party committees looking at the energy sector. The ruling Liberal 
Democratic Party also has one committee looking at energy. In addition, MITI 
is in the process of forming a new advisory group comprising academics to 
consider the next stage of deregulation. 

As you are aware, we have been working the regulatory aspects through MITI 
and the US Government for some time now with a degree of success - in fact, 
the majority of our 12 month goals have been achieved. Recently, with the 
addition of Kimura, we have increased our level of contact with senior 
political figures in Japan.

Both MITI and the USG continue to seek Enron's views on issues relating to 
the current deregulation process and the way Enron wants to see electricity 
deregulation. We have recently addressed the parliamentary Deregulation 
Committee which reports to the Prime Minister and regularly provide 
educational presentations to MITI on issues relevant to deregulation. 
Further, senior political figures are now recognizing that Enron can assist 
in the deregulation process in a positive way.

What we appear to have in Japan in the electricity sector is a reasonably 
clean slate and the opportunity to have a major say in how things should be 
structured in the future.

Ken Lay's links with the Republican Presidential campaign has received media 
attention in Japan and it is believed in Government circles here that he will 
receive a cabinet position if Gov. Bush is elected. As a result, Mr Lay 
currently carries a great deal of weight in senior Government circles in 
Japan. In the period prior to the Presidential election, we have an ideal 
opportunity to get our message across at the highest levels of the Japanese 
Government through Mr Lay.

A meeting between Mr Lay and Prime Minister and other senior Government 
members would significantly increase Enron's profile in Japan and assist in 
conveying our vision for the next phase of deregulation.

If Mr Lay were to visit Japan, possibly in late October or early November, we 
would also look at coordinating the Tokyo office opening with the visit and 
arrange a number of high level commercial meetings. Prime Minister Mori and 
the US Ambassador have already expressed an interest in attending the office 
opening. 

Both Joe Hirl and I would like to speak with you further about the above. 
When would be a convenient time?

kind regards

FYI. Joe's interview article was carried in the March edition of "Energy 
Forum", a well-known magazine in the Japanese energy industry. The interview 
was done in early February. The March edition has a special feature issue 
focusing on financial technology - entitled "Energy Big Bang and Financial 
Big Bang".

The leadership situation in Japan is always relatively volatile and this 
period is no exception.  Following a further political gall by the PM over 
the North Korean hostage situation and ongoing adverse media attention on his 
cabinet, it is likely that the PM and his senior cabinet will be replaced 
within weeks, if not days.

As a matter of protocol the successors to the Prime Minister and Minister of 
State, Nakagawa, will keep the appointments set by the predecessors.  The 
focus is more on the position than the individual - so the Minister of State 
will open the office in the name of the PM whether it is Nakagawa or someone 
else.  Similarly, Mr Lay will have a meeting with the PM whether it is Mori 
or his successor.

Fortunately, we have very good relationships with the person most likely to 
be the next PM of Japan - Mr Katoh - and the person who will most likely be 
the next head of the Governing LDP - Mr Kamei.  Both Mr Katoh and Mr Kamei 
have indicated that they will attend the office opening.

As mentioned in my previous note, we had anticipated that the budget 
legislation would have been passed well before the office opening.  I also 
mentioned that the budget is likely to pass on the 31st or 1st.  One possible 
scenario on the timing for the replacement of Mori is immediately after the 
budget legislation is passed.  That timing would be problematic for us, as 
most senior politicians would be focused on the change of leadership during 
that period.

I will keep you informed as the political situation develops.

I attach the latest stats for the website. We are still getting an average of 
over 500 visitors per day, with an average stay of about 11 minutes.



I also attach links to the proposed additions to the website for this month.

We are adding two new educational sections describing risk management and 
weather derivatives and a new calculator to give consumers an ability to 
calculate how much their electricity costs will increase as fuel prices 
increase. We have also improved the navigation around the site.

A feature article comparing the dereg experience in the telecom sector and 
the tactics used by the incumbent monopoly NTT with the electricity sector 
will follow shortly.

Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  it appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect, but nothing has progressed to executive management or 
board approval.   We are using the following statement to respond to media 
inquiries:


Enron and its affiliates, including E Power, continuously look at a number of 
projects around the world.  There is a good deal of advance preparation and 
various factors that need to be evaluated before these projects can progress 
forward through approvals.  Therefore, it is Enron's practice not to comment 
on these projects until they reach a sufficiently advanced stage of 
development to have a significant prospect for success.  Enron and/or E Power 
do not have a power project in Japan which is sufficiently advanced to 
warrant comment at this time.

We will keep you apprised of further significant developments.

John

Subject: Office Opening

Tori,
I understand that Rosalee is out of the office. In her absence, I thought you 
should be aware of the following. 

PM Mori has confirmed that he is available to meet with Mr Lay on 1 November. 
However, he has advised that he will be unable to attend the office opening. 
Parliament is in session at the moment and budget debate has been delayed as 
a result of extended debate on the amendment to the electoral rules. The PM 
has advised that he will be in budget deliberations on the 31st.

The PM has proposed that he be represented at the office opening by his #2 - 
Hidenao Nakagawa  -  Minister of State and Chief Cabinet Secretary. Nakagawa, 
as Minister of State, is Japan's official spokesperson and will open the 
office in the name of the PM.

Nakagawa is generally regarded as being responsible for the PM's policy 
direction and plays a vital role in supporting PM Mori's fragile leadership. 
Significantly, Nakagawa is currently responsible for the government's 
Information Technology (IT) policies, the Government's most important 
initiative at present. He is vice-chair of the Government's IT Strategy 
Conference and  formerly held the post of Vice Minister of MITI.

In my view, this is not a bad outcome. In some respects we get the best of 
both worlds. The office is opened in the name of the PM and we have the 
attendance of the man who is likely to be more highly regarded among those 
who will attend the office opening.    

I will send separately to Tori Wells, with a copy to you, the draft meeting 
schedule.

kind regards

Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect, but nothing has progressed to high level management 
or board approval 


We are in the process of providing interviews and responding to inquiries 
from major Japanese media and others.  These inquiries have been in 
anticipation of the March 21 partial liberalization of the Japanese power 
sector.  These discussions also are being utilized to confirm that Enron will 
be opening a merchant office in Japan.  This is in addition to the EnCom/E 
Power affiliate, which is focused on industrial power generation.  Attached 
are the Q&As we are using in response to media inquiries.

JAPAN:
Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

05/15/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).

"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per
year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo.
Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates.

But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high
electricity rates.

A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh)
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy.

Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity
rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international
market.

Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating
its market in 1998.

These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said.

"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"
Kean said.

North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp.

In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp.

Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he
said held many benefits.

Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The measure
liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended Japan's 10
power utilities regional monopoly.

However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and
that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.

Bloomberg, 10/31/00


JAPAN: UPDATE 1-Enron says priority in Japan is electricity market.

10/31/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Enron Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay 
said on Tuesday the Houston-based company's near-term priority in Japan was 
the electricity supply market, which is undergoing deregulation. 
"One of our highest priorities...in the next two or three years is 
electricity," Lay told a news conference.
Last year, Enron established its first Japanese venture, E Power, to try to 
break into Japan's electricity market that since March has allowed 
non-utility firms to supply power to large-lot industrial and commercial 
users. 
Japanese media have reported that Enron, North America's leading buyer and 
seller of electricity and natural gas, plans to build a coal-fired power 
plant in Fukuoka prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu. 
Asked whether Enron planned to buy or build a power plant in Japan, Lay said 
the company believed there was surplus capacity in Japan on which it hoped to 
draw. 
"Our belief is, if anything, today there probably is surplus capacity both of 
generation and transmission capacity," Lay said. 
"It's not a matter that we are reluctant to buy or build assets," he said. 
"If the market has surplus capacity, there's not much reason to do that, at 
least initially." 
Enron also unveiled on Tuesday a package offering eligible electricity users 
three-to five-year electricity contracts that it says will reduce their 
electricity bills by up to 10 percent for the first year, with the 
possibility of further reductions for the remaining years of the contract. 
Several other foreign energy firms have also shown an interest in entering 
the Japanese market. 
These include U.S. oil major Texaco Inc , Vivendi SA and the Royal 
Dutch/Shell Group . 
None has started actually supplying electricity to large-lot consumers in 
Japan, however. Enron set up a second subsidiary in May, Enron Japan Corp, 
with the aim of seeking business opportunities other than electricity supply 
in Japan, mainly through EnronOnline. 
The Web-based EnronOnline trading system had, as of October 11, executed more 
than 350,000 transactions with a gross value of $183 billion on the system 
since it was launched in late 1999. 
Enron uses the online system to make markets in commodities such as pulp and 
paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband capacity, in addition to gas and 
power.

Enron's Japan Unit To Offer "Elec Discount Pdt" Nov

10/31/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the Houston-based energy and 
communications giant, said Tuesday its wholly-owned subsidiary Enron Japan 
Corp. will offer effective Nov. 1 an "electricity discount product" targeting 
Japan's high-volume large-lot power users, numbering 8,000. 
Joseph Hirl, Enron Japan's president and chief executive officer, told 
reporters that his company is "already working with a number of entities" to 
discuss power supply contracts.
Enron's package, which will typically run three to five years, will allow 
customers to "immediately" cut up to 10% in their current electricity costs 
for the first year of the contracts, with the possibility of further 
reduction for the following years. 
In the first full year of the contract, Enron will pay a financial rebate of 
up to 10% to a customer on a kilowatt-hour basis, under the customers' 
existing power supply contracts with other power suppliers. 
Enron will pay a rebate in the first year but will not actually supply 
electricity. 
>From the second year onward, Enron will supply actual electricity to the 
customer at agreed fixed prices. 
Under the government's partial deregulation implemented March 21, high-volume 
large-lot retail electricity consumers - which represent roughly 27% of 
Japan's total power demand - can now freely choose their power suppliers. 
Enron declined to elaborate on how it plans to secure electricity necessary 
for fulfilling the proposed contracts. 
Enron Corp.'s chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay, who was speaking at the same 
press conference, said the company's highest priority in the Japanese market 
for the next two to three years will be electricity trading and marketing. 
Next comes trading in metals, weather derivatives and pulp and paper, Lay 
said. 

In addition to those main focus areas, Enron Japan's Hirl said there is 
"tremendous potential" in areas such as liquefied natural gas, coal and 
foreign exchange trading. 
"We're looking to provide much services we can at the best price, and in many 
cases at lower prices, in most of the services we provide," Hirl said. 
Enron also plans to introduce broadband services in Japan. 
"For the next two to three years, establishing and extending our broadband 
network in Japan is a key part of our growth," said Kenneth Rice, chairman 
and CEO of Enron Broadband Services. 
Japan is a huge Internet market and it's also a logical foothold for Enron to 
extend its network into the rest of Asia, he said. 
By offering "EnronOnline" - the world's largest business-to-business 
electronic commerce platform, "Enron can help the Japanese economy become 
more efficient by significantly reducing the costs of many products and 
services," Lay said.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE
Arena flier rouses ire of backers 
Letter attacks plan, mayor and Democrats 
By ERIC BERGER 
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle 
Arena proponents are decrying a letter circulating among area Republicans 
that ties the proposal to Houston Mayor Lee Brown and contains at least six 
factual errors. 
Brown, a central figure in the 1999 arena proposition that voters rejected, 
has had a considerably less visible role in this year's effort. Many 
Republicans viewed a vote against the arena last year as a vote against 
Brown, a Democrat, and an opportunity to embarrass him. 
"There are three areas where we believe Mayor Lee Brown's multimillion-dollar 
corporate welfare campaign must be addressed," states the letter, which was 
mailed to more than 500 Republicans and was sponsored by Republican precinct 
chairwoman Mary Jane Smith. 
What it fails to mention is that conservative U.S. Rep. Bill Archer, 
R-Houston, has endorsed the plan and that the pro-arena campaign chairmen are 
notable Republican fund-raisers Ken Lay and Don Jordan. 
"I suppose she believes that we've programmed Lay and Jordan to vote 
Democrat," said pro-arena campaign manager Dave Walden. "And that I spent a 
day hypnotizing Bill Archer." 
Beyond Brown, the letter also seeks to tie the pro-arena campaign to Vice 
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate. 
"They have teamed up with Democrat activists and Mayor Lee P. Brown to 
connect arena and Gore voters," according to the letter. "Turn out a 
pro-arena vote and you turn out a Gore vote." 
Such questionable associations -- Lay, for example, is one of Republican 
presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush's closest business advisers -- 
offer a vivid look at how desperate arena opponents are, Walden contends. 
This criticism failed to stymie Smith, who plans to send out another printing 
of the letter this week. "All of my Republican buddies are opposed to this," 
she said. "I think it's kind of funny the arena people are taking the 
attitude of `How dare anyone question us?' " 
The letter, which clearly targets Brown, further suggests that "what Houston 
lacks is world-class leaders" who would have negotiated a tougher deal with 
Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander. 
"Mayor Lee Brown won't fund the immunization of Houston's poor Hispanic 
children, but he is able to build a parking garage benefiting a handful of 
multimillionaires," the letter says. 
Walden called that statement racist. 
It is also inaccurate, as the city is not building the parking garage. A 
group of private business leaders, headed by Lay, will lend the Harris 
County-Houston Sports Authority $30 million for the garage. The sports 
authority, and its hotel and car rental tax revenues, are not affiliated with 
the city. 
Among other errors in the letter: 
? "The ballot language does NOT rule out ... the usual cost overruns." This 
is irrelevant because the Houston Rockets pay construction cost overruns. 
? "Taxpayers fund and build the arena garage with Les Alexander reaping ALL 
of the parking fees." The private, interest-free loan will help the sports 
authority finance the garage. To help repay the loan, the sports authority 
will collect parking fees during the daytime and at concerts and other events 
that don't involve Alexander's Rockets, Comets and ThunderBears. 
? Although the city gets use of the arena for 20 dates a year, the letter 
says that only five days may be leased for revenue. In fact, all 20 dates may 
be used for fund-raisers. This was clarified in changes to the letter of 
agreement between the Rockets and the sports authority. 
? "This year's ballot language gives an incredible $200 million to the 
Rockets for naming rights, while the city receives less than 10 percent." 
Under terms of the agreement, the Rockets may sell the naming rights to the 
arena, but it is unlikely the team would receive $200 million. Such a payment 
is not guaranteed by the ballot language. The city receives 5 percent of the 
revenue from the sale of the naming rights. 
? "Today, Houston is building the Hobby Arts Center, again, with no public 
funding. If we can use private funding for the arts, why can't our sports 
owners fund their own projects?" Actually, the city donated land appraised at 
$35 million for the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, and gave another 
$30 million in hotel taxes toward its construction. The city also gives $8 
million annually to the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, a $3.5 million 
subsidy to the Wortham Center and a $1.5 million subsidy to Jones Hall. 


	


AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)
10/30/0 18:40 (New York)

AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)

     (Adds company, analyst comments starting in fourth
paragraph.)

     San Francisco, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- American Electric Power
Co., a Columbus, Ohio-based owner of utilities in 11 U.S. states
and Europe, said it will split its regulated utilities from its
less-regulated businesses, creating two wholly owned companies.
     The company also said it has ruled out merging Seeboard Plc,
a natural gas and power distributor it owns in England, with
Yorkshire Electricity Plc, a U.K. utility partly owned by AEP.
     The separation of its businesses is patterned on plans it has
already filed in Ohio and Texas, AEP said. Earlier this year, the
company was required to separate all or most of its power plants
and assets from its transmission lines and related assets in those
states as part of efforts to open the Ohio and Texas markets to
competition.
     The separation will take about a year to complete, said E.
Linn Draper Jr., AEP's chairman, president and chief executive
officer. Once it is completed, AEP will have the option of
spinning off one of the two companies.
     ``We will have options of IPO, spin-off, divestiture,''
Draper told analysts at the Edison Electric Institute conference
in San Francisco.
     As deregulation is approved in other states, AEP said, it
plans to move all of its transmission system into the company that
runs its regulated utilities, which will continue to have fixed
rates of return set by regulators, and move its power plants into
the company that runs less-regulated businesses with more
opportunities for growth.
     ``I think it's the best way for them to organize such a big
company,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analyst Barry Abramson, who has a
``neutral'' rating on AEP. ``It'll focus better attention on the
growth business, not the slower-growing distribution business.''

                       `Undervalued' Shares

     Draper told analysts that part of the reason for the
restructuring is to raise the value of the company's shares by
more clearly showing the performance of its better-performing
generation, wholesale marketing and trading businesses.
     ``We are very unhappy about the stock price,'' Draper said.
``We think it is significantly undervalued.''
     The wholesale power business -- the buying and selling of
power between utilities and other large consumers and generators -
- is already deregulated.
     ``We have no plans to expand our distribution business either
in the United States or internationally,'' Draper said.
     AEP said it will file its restructuring plan with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this week and complete
the separation by the end of 2001, in line with the deregulation
timetable in Texas and other states it serves.
     AEP completed the $10 billion acquisition of Central & South
West Corp. in June, creating a utility with 5 million customers.
Seeboard and the stake in Yorkshire came with the purchase.
     In February, then-Central & Southwest President Tom Shockley,
now AEP vice chairman, discussed the possibility of merging
Seeboard and Yorkshire. U.K. utilities have been squeezed recently
by taxes and regulated price cuts.
     Combining those businesses provided no major cost savings,
Draper said today.
     ``We think that keeping them separate gives us options,'' he
said. ``It simply made better sense to keep our options open.''
     AEP owns more than 38,000 megawatts of generation. About
25,000 megawatts of the company's generation will be deregulated
by the end of 2001. AEP also is the No. 2 power trader and
marketer after Enron Corp.
     Shares of Columbus, Ohio-based AEP rose $1.88 to $41.81.

The result does give the Government a mandate for reform and the pace of reform should increase. The issue is whether the Government will focus on areas that will make a difference. 

Koizumi's policies include: reducing public debt, reforming the budget allocation process and implementing deregulation with "no sacred cows". In the near term Koizumi's cabinet will focus on areas of public popularity - IT, urban renewal, the environment, ageing society, education, science and technology and regional revitalisation. While energy is not currently on the LDP priority list, the pro-reformers within the Regulatory Reform Committee (a committee established within the Cabinet Office) are likely to push harder with their reform initiatives, including energy sector reforms. 

Significant hurdles remain for Koizumi notwithstanding the mandate: the reformers still remain in the minority within the LDP ( the status quo faction - former Prime Minister Hashimoto's faction - was the biggest winner from the election) and the Government policies for reform are strongly deflationary, with a danger that Koizumi will quickly burn political capital.

In terms of where we are at in the energy reform process - with the release of the Brattle paper last Spring and the confirmation by the METI Minister in July that the electricity review process would commence two years earlier than expected, the utilities realised that they had lost the initiative in the deregulation debate. They are now seeking to regain the initiative and using their political influence to do so.

It is no surprise that the utilities remain a very a powerful lobby group. TEPCO alone spends an estimated US$ 50 - 100 million pa on its public relations activities here. That does not include the direct political donations to the LDP and the soft donations through their construction programs.
 
In order to get the utilities to agree to the acceleration of the electricity review by two years and to get them back to the table, METI agreed that the review would initially focus on competition reform to encourage new entry into small and medium sized plant development. METI is confident that they can broaden the review once the process commences.  

The provisional schedule is as follows:
Sep - Dec 2001: confirmation of positions of stakeholders and discussion of basic policy direction
Jan - June 2002: discussion of basic framework
Jul - Dec 2002: detailed design of system
2004: likely implementation    

Our focus has shifted from accelerating the process to ensuring that the review covers the right issues. 

I have tentative plans to be in Houston Thursday/ Friday next week with Joe Hirl in connection with the discussions on the possible alliance with Nissho Iwai. Would you be available on Thursday pm or Friday for a more complete briefing?

Dear Steve,

Please find enclosed a note on the results of the Upper House election held here in Japan on July 29. 

In a nutshell, there were no real surprises. The ruling coalition achieved a comfortable majority of 12 seats, for a total of 136 seats, in the 247 seat chamber. 

I'd be happy to put together a more detailed analysis if needed.

Yours,

SK - I've printed this out & put it in your meeting folder.  mm

Steve, I attach a briefing paper for your visit. A hard copy will be 
available for you on arrival. The paper includes the following:
Itinerary
Conference details
Brattle paper summary
Media interview background
General key messages
Electricity wholesaling reactive statement
Political update
Meeting briefing notes




You will note one further change to the itinerary. We will be meeting with 
METI rather than the Fair Trade Commission. The purpose of the METI meeting 
will be to explain our concerns with the current regulatory environment and 
Enron Japan's proposal to temporarily suspend its electricity wholesaling 
activities. We met with our METI working level contacts today to brief them 
on Brattle and in particular the shortcomings of the current system. We did 
not discuss suspension of our wholesaling activities. The meeting briefing 
notes will be available on your arrival in Tokyo.


I also attach the latest version of the Brattle paper and, for completeness, 
the final version of the presentation and notes. 




I will call you at the Palace Hotel on Monday at 6pm. If you have any hiccups 
with arrangements please let me know. My contact numbers are as follows:

Home 813 52610539
Mobile 8190 27334795

Enron urges more electric power reform



05/16/2001 
The Yomiuri Shimbun / Daily Yomiuri



Copyright (C) 2001 The Yomiuri Shimbun; Source: World Reporter (TM) - Asia 
Intelligence Wire
?

?
Enron Japan Corp., a Japanese subsidiary of United States energy giant Enron 
Corp., published a reform proposal for the Japanese electricity market 
Tuesday. 
The proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a 
two-year period beginning at the start of 2002, following deregulation of the 
Japanese retail electric power market, which began in March this year. 
?



Japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and 
commercial users since March. 
Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a large-scale basis 
following the deregulation efforts. 
In the reform proposal, Enron Japan argued that the present liberalization of 
the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing 
that Japanese electricity charges were 46 percent higher than average when 
compared with those of other member countries in the Organization of Economic 
Cooperation and Development. 
Enron's reform proposal includes 10 measures to promote competitiveness in 
the Japanese market, such as a separation of conventional power companies' 
supply operations from the generation, transmission and distribution of 
electricity. 
The proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies 
that should be prohibited from constructing new electricity-generating 
facilities within the areas they currently supply. It also urges the 
privatizing of operations for the development of power sources. These measure 
are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a 
competitive foothold. 
In March Enron applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture to build a large 
thermal power plant in Rokkashomura.

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said. 
?



At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that "industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia." 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.






Japan could cut 4 tril. yen a year in energy costs - Enron.

Japanese industries could save 4 trillion yen a year in energy costs if 
electricity charges were lowered to European and U.S. levels, a senior 
executive of U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. said Tuesday. 
At a business gathering in Tokyo, Steven Kean, an executive vice president of 
Enron, said electricity charges are still rising in Japan despite progress in 
cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
?


Japan needs to remove regulations on power transmission lines and let users 
choose suppliers freely, he said. 
Establishing an independent supervising body for the industry and mapping out 
transparent rules for information disclosure are also necessary, he said. 
Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a full-fledged basis 
following Japan's deregulation in March of its retail electric power market. 
In March, it applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan, for 
a plan to build a large thermal power plant in the village of Rokkasho.






JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
"If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year," Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo. 
?



Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
"The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California," 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.






Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus


?

?
TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000. 
?



However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
"What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly," said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
"There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization," Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. "If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity." 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called "Reassessing Power 
Deregulation," which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 
      

  Hatta of the University of Tokyo said "it's very wise" that Japan has begun
the deregulation with the "bilateral supply, or trade" system under which
suppliers and users clinch deals directly.    

  Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market -
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation.   

  Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power
providers, Hatta said.    

  Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs
are levied on prices.    

  "There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices" nationwide,
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said.    

  Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233)
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation.    

  Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with "strong back-up" from the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.    

  "Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select
independent power providers," Omuro said.

Steve, I attach a draft presentation based in concept on the presentation 
that you sent through.

Broadly, the presentation is designed to provide an international perspective 
to the liberalization of electricity markets, in the context of the Japanese 
emerging markets. As you are aware, the conference coincides with the public 
release of the Brattle paper commissioned by Enron Japan which makes specific 
recommendations for electricity sector reform in Japan. 

The notes accompanying the slides are intended to provide a Japanese context 
to international examples. We have added an advertisement of Enron Japan 
towards the end of the presentation which is styled as a practical example of 
the new energy company. Its purpose is to start the process of shifting the 
public focus on Enron Japan away from energy wholesaling.

The speaking time is 50minutes. The audience will be middle to senior 
management from utilities, large-lot users, METI, the US Government, 
consultants and others. The press will be attending.

I will provide a briefing note on the conference shortly.

I would welcome your comments. I will try to catch you Wednesday afternoon 
your time to discuss. 



kind regards

FTC To Boost Staff By 40% As Probe Requests Rise 
TOKYO (Nikkei)--The Fair Trade Commission will increase its staff by 40% from 
the current 570 to 800 in five years under its medium-term plan, The Nihon 
Keizai Shimbun learned Tuesday.
In particular, the FTC aims to beef up its inspection functions to prevent 
illegal activities, such as price cartels and obstruction of entry into the 
information and data communications market. The upgraded inspection ability 
will also speed up the screening of mega-mergers for approval, thus helping 
accelerate ongoing industrial realignment in Japan.
Most of the planned increases will come in Tokyo, where the number of 
inspection division personnel investigating cases such as cartels will be 
doubled from the current 200.
With deregulation, the number of filings from businesses requesting FTC 
probes has increased sharply. In fiscal 2000, such filings totaled 2,878, up 
33.7% from a year earlier. But in many cases, personnel shortages prevented 
the FTC from making thorough investigations or it took too long to complete 
them.
The plan will also enhance the FTC's ability to protect consumers. With the 
expansion of online shopping, the number of products with misleading labels 
has increased sharply. The FTC will increase the number of personnel to 
oversee and prevent such malpractice.
The FTC will seek to have the proposals in the plan incorporated into a set 
of guidelines to be compiled in late June by the Council on Economic and 
Fiscal Policy headed by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

SPECIAL REPORT: THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF CORPORATE JAPAN
        With so much attention now focused on which Koizumi reforms are
really required to reform Japan's economy, we went directly to ask someone
who evaluates the strategy and performance of specific Japanese corporations
every day.  The Director of Corporate Ratings at Standard & Poor?s Japan
offers his views on whether Japan's managers are ready for and actively
engaging in real restructuring.  He shares what he knows about Japanese
corporates' financial sophistication, systems, accounting standards, credit
trends, and the overall current state of corporate Japan?s financial health.


 
A SPECIALIST OFFERS ADVICE: "A JAPAN ACQUISITION THAT (LUCKILY) NEVER

        This second part of our specialist's two-part article about an
acquisition abandoned because of employee compensation and benefit issues
offers a rare, inside look at some of the ?brass tacks? issues that
companies often consider during such a process. Readers who have not
participated in such a process may find some of our contributor's notes to
his client, included in this article, rather harsh in their tone and intent.
Nevertheless, the notes demonstrate the complexity of the many issues
acquiring executives face in evaluating a potential acquisition in Japan,
and should not be construed as anything but a competent professional?s best
advice to an important client.

Steve -- Here is background for the Japan Public TV interview on Thursday 
morning.  Per your request, I asked Nick and Mika for the information and got 
this back from Mika on behalf of both.  It's a pretty comprehensive memo, and 
I know you're busy, but it appears to be a lot of Japan perspective that you 
could benefit from going in.

Vance,
I attached a briefing material for Steve which contained major soundbites, 
key messages and some Japan-related issues that may be relevant for the NHK 
interview. Some points in this material overlap with the Nikkei briefing 
material which Nick gave to Steve two weeks ago. I have refrained from 
including some bullet points on our activities in Japan, because Joseph Hirl, 
Enron Japan President and CEO, did an interview with NHK yesterday for the 
same program. NHK's interview with Steve would likely focus on California, 
because many of its questions on Enron Japan's businesses here were answered 
by Joe. NHK plans to combine Steve and Joe's interviews for the same program. 
If you have any questions, please call me at 813-5219-4581 tomorrow morning 
our time or Wednesday afternoon your time.

best regards,
Mika

Subject: URGENT REQUEST

Steve Kean will be interviewing with Japanese Public Television on Thursday 
morning to complement the work that has already been done on this project in 
Japan.  Steve is being asked to talk about deregulation, specifically the 
lessons learned from the California crisis and how Japan might do it 
differently.

Steve asked me to contact both of you regarding

Common messages being emphasized on the Japan end.
Any difficult issues to be aware of, such as biases the network might bring 
to this topic or potentially unanticipated questions that we might encounter.
Also, Steve didn't ask for this, but it might be helpful if you could send a 
few bullet points on our current activity, intentions and progress in Japan.

Thank you very much.  Again, I'll need it today (your time) if possible as 
the interview is Thursday morning Houston time.

Jim, 

Thanks for taking time to look through the Brattle Group recommendations for 
Japan. 

Some of your comments refer to serious issues in the design of a competitive 
market for electricity here. Brattle's analysis of the Japanese electricity 
system concludes that market concentration is the main reason for the failure 
of current reforms. The recommendations then focus on providing practical 
means of reducing market power in Japan, followed by implementation of a pool 
with bilateral trading to create non-discriminatory access to network 
resources and services.

Would you be able to take some time to talk to Nick O'Day and myself about 
your comments on Tuesday evening? Around 5.30 p.m. your time would be ideal 
for us if you're available.

Best regards
Mark

		 Subject: Re: Recommendations for Japanese Electricity Reform

Some thoughts --

1. We argue against the PJM Installed Capacity obligation.  Basically it is 
another rent capture system for generators.  

2. Don't really understand your stranded cost recovery scheme.  Looks like a 
transmission level charge.  Is it $/mw or $/mwh?  

3. Your model for a pool doesn't solve the key problem of market power.  
Putting a pool in place w/o dealing w/ market power is a recipe for disaster.

4. You don't talk about "Market Based Rate" authority.  Would all generators, 
including incumbent generation be allowed to bid their price or must they bid 
cost?  This is critical.  This is the real carrot to get the Utilities off of 
the stick - mandatory participation with cost-based bidding for Incumbents 
until under 1,000 (?) HHI.

Good luck,

Jim

Subject: Recommendations for Japanese Electricity Reform

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

Commencing with an NHK (Japanese public TV) report and quickly spreading to 
media inquiries and wire reports, earlier today a story spread through Japan 
that the Enron affiliate E Power has immediate plans to build at least one 
large (1000 MW) power plant.   In fact,  appears that E Power has been 
pursuing this prospect on a smaller scly, but nothing has progressed to high 
level management or board approval.




We are in the process of providing interviews and responding to inquiries 
from major Japanese media and others.  These inquiries have been in 
anticipation of the March 21 partial liberalization of the Japanese power 
sector.  These discussions also are being utilized to confirm that Enron will 
be opening a merchant office in Japan.  This is in addition to the EnCom/E 
Power affiliate, which is focused on industrial power generation.  Attached 
are the Q&As we are using in response to media inquiries.

I attach a brief overview of the May 15 conference.

Landmark Conference. The conference, to be held on May 15 and 16, will be the 
most significant conference on energy sector deregulation in Japan this year. 
We expect the Japanese press to provide extensive coverage of the conference.
 
Enron Orchestrating. The conference is being organized by Marcus Evans 
(formerly ICM), a reputable international conference organizer, and is being 
orchestrated by Enron. We are driving the timing, the seminar content and the 
speakers behind the scenes. 

Timing. The conference is timed to coincide with the commencement of 
government deliberations on further competition reforms to Japan's 
electricity market. In addition, Enron Japan will have just released a 
comprehensive white paper on recommended reforms to the Japanese electricity 
market.

Speakers. Mr Skilling would have the first key note speech on the first day. 
He would be followed by the head of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and 
Industry - the Ministry responsible for the energy sector.

Other scheduled speakers include: The president of NTT; the President of 
Tokyo Electric Power Corporation; a FERC Commissioner; a senior European 
regulator; former Prime Minister Hashimoto, as chairman of the Natural Energy 
Promotion Association; the Dean of the Tokyo University Graduate School of 
Financial Engineering; and senior management from Toyota Motor Corporation 
and Asahi Chemical Corporation.

Other Meetings. We would propose meetings with: the press -  one on ones 
and/or, if appropriate, a press conference; senior Government officials 
(Ministerial level); senior commercial relationships (Chairman/ CEO level) eg 
Orix Corp., Tokyo Electric Power Corp., Itochu Corp., Hitachi Group, Kawasaki 
Group.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards

Steve, Mark

Please find attached a draft Q&A on our power marketing position in Japan.  I 
thought you might find it useful background in case you meet with John 
Sherriff while he is over in Houston this week.  I understand that John is 
now minded NOT to make an internal announcement about the proposed changes.  
However we will need to make changes to the EJ website and to the standard 
media pack.  Let me know if I can help with anything else.

Steve, we received a request from METI in Tokyo last Friday to arrange a 
meeting in Houston for Mr Hirata from METI to discuss gas issues. The meeting 
was largely driven by the travel schedule of Mr Hirata rather than a specific 
need to meet with Enron. I query whether this is the same enquiry, via a 
different channel, that you mentioned this morning. We asked Robert 
Neustaedter to meet with Mr Hirata. The meeting took place today in Houston.

In any event, I attach a copy of a presentation given by Joe to METI last 
month which reflects our current thinking on gas issues in Japan.

I will let you know what the outcome of the Houston meeting.

I would be happy to share Enron's US regulatory experience with Mr. Hirata.  
May 2 would probably work better for me, if possible.  If you could advise on

Robert,

I am writing to see whether you can help us out with a sudden request that we 
have had from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI). A 
Mr. Hirata, Director of Oil and Natural Gas Division, Resources and Fuel 
Department in METI is in Houston early next week and would like to visit 
Enron to talk about gas market and pipeline investment issues. He is not 
responsible for gas deregulation but plays a role in the potential 
development of a gas pipeline into northern Japan from Russia (the Sakhalin 
line), bearing some relation therefore to E-Power's (Enron asset development 
subsidiary in Japan) plans for a gas-fired power plant in the North.

Would it be possible for you to meet him informally for an hour on 1 or 2 
May? We appreciated the amount of work that you put into the presentation for 
our main METI gas contact Mr. Ueda last year. This time, we would not expect 
a formal presentation from you, given the short notice and our limited 
contact with Mr. Hirata. Also, Mr. Hirata appears happy just to discuss 
issues informally.

For your information, I attach a presentation that Joe Hirl made at a recent 
Government gas deregulation committee explaining Enron's views on 
deregulation of the Japanese gas market. I'm sure you will recognize a number 
of the slides.

Could you let me know of the possibility of this meeting? I will also try to 
phone you later to answer any comments you may have. Thank you for your help.

Best regards
Mark Crowther
Manager, Public Affairs
Enron Japan

Subject: Ken Lay meetings

Rosalee, I attach a draft list of meetings for Mr Lay for the 31October and 1 
November. The purpose of sending you the list now is to give you a general 
idea as to the type of meetings we are considering. I also attach a brief 
background note on each meeting.



I will be sending you a full briefing pack for Mr Lay prior to the visit. In 
the interim please let me know if you have any questions in relation to the 
attached.



A couple of housekeeping questions:
I understand that Mr Lay has an allergy to shell fish. Is that restricted to 
eating or does it extend to smell - ie do we need to eliminate shellfish from 
the buffet. In addition, we propose including sushi in the buffet. Same 
question - would this pose a problem for Mr Lay?
What standard of hotel accommodation would be appropriate for Mr Lay. We have 
reserved a range of rooms for Enron people at the Hotel Okura (part of the 
Leading Hotels of the World group), venue for the office opening and press 
conference. 

I look forward to hearing from you.

kind regards

Gentlemen, we are in the final stages of development of the website. As you 
are aware, Anthony Dayao and I have been given the responsibility to develop 
the site. Anthony is generally responsible for the technical aspects, while I 
am covering the content. 

The content for the regulatory section (Japan Market) has now been finalized 
and final versions will be put onto the site shortly. In the meantime, I 
attach final versions in word format. The graphs for sections 1, 3 and 4 are 
set out in the attached excel spread sheet. 

  

We are aiming for site finalization by 13 October, Internal launch - 20 
October, public launch on 24 October and public announcement of the site on 
27 October  

The groups that we are looking for sign off from prior to 20 October are:

Legal - Alan Aronowitz/ Jane McBride
Public relations - Mark Palmer/ Jackie Gentle
Technical -  Corp. webmaster
Govt Affairs - Steve Kean/ Mark Schroeder
Commercial - Joe Hirl

I would be grateful if you could review the attached articles and let me know 
if you have any concerns or comments. You will see earlier drafts of the 
articles on the development site at  dev.enron.co.jp.

kind regards

Subject: Enron Japan website

Mark,

As foreshadowed last week, we gave a presentation to Mark Palmer this morning 
on the proposed Enron Japan website. Mark will be briefing Steve Kean 
tomorrow. We ran through a few background slides set out in the presentation 
and then went through the development site - dev.enron.co.jp. A copy of the 
presentation is attached.



In broad terms, we covered the following:

Why we are building the site
Who we are targeting
Reinforced that the site is commercially focused -  not brochure ware
Reinforced that the amount of material on the site is manageable and that we 
had procedures in place to regularly update the site
Sought ongoing support for new material.

I attach first drafts of articles which we propose including in the 
regulatory section . You can also view these articles in draft on the 
website  -  entry via the homepage pictures or in the Japan Market page.

 We clearly need to conform the graphs and recheck the facts and figures with 
a fine tooth comb. With that in mind, I would welcome your input on the 
content and the list of proposed future articles - set out on page 8 of the 
presentation.



We are proposing to have the website up and running by mid October with a 
view to launching the site to the public on 31 October, the date of the 
office opening. Between now and then we need to tidy up the drafts, translate 
them and then get sign off from PR, legal and Enron's web master.

I will try to give you a call  later today to briefly discuss.

kind regards

Please find attached the latest draft of the Brattle Group's recommendations 
for the Japanese power industry and the accompanying appendices.

You will find changes in emphasis and structure, which make the paper more 
convincing, comprehensive and readable. We have tried to include a global 
view of market objectives in keeping with your approach in Houston, to give 
better explanations of why our recommendations are right for Japan at this 
stage and to address potential objections from deregulation's critics in 
Japan.

In addition to its earlier content, the new draft:

includes a new section setting up the objectives of a competitive market and 
defining a workably competitive market, before making specific 
recommendations to achieve those objectives in Japan;

addresses objections by utilities, etc. in Japan to our proposals. Current 
opinions or issues circulating in Japan include: California crisis, 
discrediting of a tight pool, success of PJM ensured by lack of requirement 
to unbundle, nuclear power development;

emphasizes the need for a strong, independent regulator given METI's recent 
inability to provide clear rules to support its recommendations and lack of 
expertise in the Fair Trade Commission;

de-emphasizes final section on public policy issues to emphasize market 
structure, by merging the public policy issues into one section, placing 
reliability at the top of the list and providing alternatives to achieve 
nuclear policy issues;

proposes implementation timetable in keeping with Japanese review process;

takes a punchier, more urgent approach in the executive summary and the paper 
as a whole.

The paper will be published as a Brattle Group paper commissioned by Enron 
Japan. Much input has been provided by Enron Japan but the economic arguments 
and general approach are in keeping with Brattle's written positions and 
standards. The written style of the paper is, of course, theirs.

We would appreciate any comments you might have on the contents of this 
paper. Since we will release the paper on 15 May and will create completed 
published versions in both English and Japanese by 11 May, please send us any 
comments by the end of this week, i.e. Friday, 4 May.

Mark,

As mentioned in our call on Tuesday, we have discussed with the US Embassy 
(State Dept) what we would like to see covered in the next round of the US 
Japan bilateral talks on deregulation in the energy sector. I attach a brief 
note which confirms in broad terms our preliminary discussions on the topic.

We are encouraging a significantly more cooperative approach by the US to 
Japan, particularly in the wake of the telecom talks earlier this year. As 
mentioned in the attached note, we believe that the Japanese Government 
genuinely wants to implement further reform, but is having difficulty in 
balancing competing policy interests. We are not advocating that the USG tell 
Japan what its environmental policy or energy policy should be. We are 
suggesting more of an advisory role. The concrete outcome would be further 
significant reforms to the electricity and gas sectors, together with a 
timetable for complete deregulation.

We have consciously stopped short of recommending a preferred structure for 
the electricity and gas sectors for a couple of reasons. Not only would it be 
inappropriate for the USG to dictate to the Japanese Government on what to do 
rather than how to do it, but determining the Enron preferred structure for 
Japan is a significant undertaking and something that we are currently 
working through. In this regard, as mentioned on Tuesday we will be looking 
for significant support from your group and clearly will need sign off from 
Europe and Houston. 

The approach we are recommending that the US Government adopts reflects the 
approach we propose adopting in Japan. To assist us in getting our message to 
the right people, we have been taking steps to further develop our 
relationships with cabinet ministers, the MITI Director General and others, 
including members of the following committees who are or will be reviewing 
various aspects of energy policy in Japan:
- the LDP Comprehensive Energy Policy Study Committee (Chair - Mr Amari) 
- the supra partisan New Energy Policy Committee ( Chair - former PM Mr 
Hashimoto)
- the business lead Deregulation Committee (Chair - Orix chairman Miyauchi)
- the MITI sponsored Liberalization of Power Industry and Public Interest 
Committee ( Comprising academics)

I would welcome your comments on the attached note.

Online college library and research firm slows pace, reduces staff by almost 
half 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Questia Media laid off half of its work force Tuesday in an effort to reduce 
costs. 
The developer of an online library and research site for college students cut 
139 jobs as it begins to slow down the pace at which books are added to the 
site. 
Founder Troy Williams said the company is finding it too hard to raise enough 
additional cash from investors to justify the pace at which it was adding 
books. 
"Customers have said they're generally satisfied with the number of books 
that are on the site right now, so it's a good time to slow down," Williams 
said of the 35,000 books currently available. "A significant number of our 
people were involved in that process." 
At one time, Questia employed more than 300 workers but cut back to about 280 
in recent weeks. The layoffs will leave the staff at about 140. 
No senior vice presidents are leaving as part of the layoffs, but Williams 
said a number of vice presidents and director-level employees have been cut. 
Laid-off employees will receive eight weeks of pay and 60 days of benefits, 
Williams said. 
"We've tried to be as humane as we could about the whole thing," Williams 
said. 
Williams said Questia's layoffs are not a result of the company growing too 
large too fast. 
"It took that many people to launch the service," Williams said. "But since 
we're not digitizing books that quickly, we just don't need that many." 
Questia was started in 1998 by Williams with the backing of investors such as 
Compaq Computer Corp. co-founder Rod Canion and Enron Chairman Ken Lay. 
The company raised more than $135 million over the past two years to build an 
online searching and note-taking interface and so far has purchased the 
rights to digitize more than 60,000 books. The company charges students about 
$20 per month for unlimited access and pays publishers based on the number of 
page views their books get from students. 
The site went live in early January but had trouble attracting the number of 
subscribers the company originally hoped for. 
In early April, following an intense television ad blitz during the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association's men's basketball tournament, the company 
had slightly more than of 1,000 paying subscribers, sources close to the 
company say. 
Company officials always said building the subscriber base would be an 
expensive long-term project. 
Several adjustments in strategy over the 14 weeks since the service launched 
indicate the original plans weren't panning out. 
On-campus membership drives were shifted first from community colleges to a 
handful of large major universities, a television ad campaign was launched 
months earlier than expected, while an early mascot was pushed into the 
background in favor of a simpler marketing message. 
The changes in strategy appear to be paying off as subscribership has jumped 
significantly in recent weeks. 
Williams wouldn't discuss the numbers, but sources say that figure has topped 
5,000. 
"We've had a fivefold increase in the number of paying subscribers in the 
past two weeks alone, which is a significant proof point in students' 
willingness to pay for such a service," Williams said. 
The company has offered the service free to nearly 100,000 students and 
faculty at four universities in recent weeks, an effort that is expected to 
bear fruit in new subscribers next fall. 
With current subscriber growth projections, he said the company is expected 
to have a positive cash flow in about 18 months. 
Questia is expected to close on another round of funding from a group of 
investors in several weeks. 
"We're very sanguine about the future," Williams said. "We have to buckle 
down over the summer. We're a very cyclical business, so we're not going to 
make great strides over the summer."

Key indexes finished mixed Tuesday but more stocks rose than fell as Wall 
Street struggled for direction ahead of the Federal Reserve's meeting next 
week. 
In the bond market short-term yields fell further, and long-term yields 
inched up after the government's disappointing report on first-quarter worker 
productivity.
The Dow Jones industrials eased 51.66 points, or 0.5%, to 10,883.51, the 
fourth loss in five sessions, as the 11,000 mark again proves to be a barrier 
for the blue-chip index. 
But the Nasdaq composite index rose 25.20 points, or 1.2%, to 2,198.77 as 
semiconductor and computer networking stocks rose ahead of Cisco Systems' 
quarterly earnings report, released after regular trading ended. 
Cisco's operating results slightly beat estimates, but the company reported a 
massive net loss as it wrote down the value of excess inventory. Cisco 
shares, which rallied $1.13 to $20.38 in regular trading, fell to $19.90 in 
after-hours activity. 
In the broad market Tuesday, winners edged losers by 21 to 17 on Nasdaq and 
by 16 to 14 on the New York Stock Exchange. Trading volume was moderate. 
Some analysts were impressed by the market's strength, especially in the wake 
of the downbeat productivity report. 
The government said worker productivity fell at a 0.1% rate in the first 
quarter, the first decline in five years. The report, though not entirely 
unexpected, raised fears about inflationary pressures in the economy. 
Productivity gains had helped hold inflation to a minimum in the late 1990s. 
Long-term Treasury bond yields rose modestly Tuesday as traders registered 
their concern about inflation's trend. 
The 10-year T-note yield ended at 5.24%, up from 5.19% Monday. 
But shorter-term yields continued to slide as traders bet that the Fed, which 
meets Tuesday, will cut its key short-term lending rate for a fifth time this 
year. 
The six-month T-bill yield slid to a new two-year low of 3.69% from 3.72% 
Monday. 
Though the central bank may lower short-term rates further, the productivity 
report "increases the likelihood that the Fed will have to reverse course 
next year," raising rates to contain inflation, Henry Willmore, chief U.S. 
economist at Barclays Capital, told Bloomberg News. 
Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
* Financial stocks remained under pressure on concerns about loan losses and 
weaker borrowing in the struggling economy. American Express fell $1.93 to 
$41.30 after Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock. 
J.P. Morgan Chase fell $1.45 to $47.75, Bank One lost 94 cents to $37.46 and 
Northern Trust fell $1.49 to $64.71. 
* Chip stocks were strong, led by PMC-Sierra, up $4.79 to $44.10; Vitesse 
Semiconductor, up $2.60 to $36.25; and Broadcom, up $2.24 to $44.53. 
But among personal computer stocks, Dell lost $1.08 to $24.83 after 
announcing new job cuts. 
Dell rival Compaq fell 27 cents to $16.83 and Apple Computer eased 39 cents 
to $24.57. 
* Among blue chips, 3M fell $1.54 to $116.36. Chief Executive James McNerney 
said at 3M's annual meeting that there are "no signs" the global economy will 
turn around any time soon. 
* Utility and energy-trading stocks were weak. Enron fell $1.93 to $56.11, 
Orion Power lost $1.04 to $28.76 and NRG Energy fell $1.64 to $31.07.

JAPAN: Japan power market not fair for newcomers-Enron.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TOKYO, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Enron Corp said on Wednesday that 
Japan's newly deregulated power market lacked competition and contained 
barriers that were deterring new entrants. 
"There's no real competition in the power market," Nicholas J.O'Day, vice 
president of Enron Japan Corp told reporters.
A number of unnecessary regulations, the high costs of the transmission 
network and other factors have thwarted attempts by newcomers to enter the 
power market, he said, adding that more reforms were needed. 
New entrants have to borrow the transmission network system from power 
utilities when they try to enter the market, but it was hard to judge whether 
the transmission fees reflect real costs, he said. 
Since March last year, non-utility firms have been allowed to begin supplying 
power to large-lot commercial users, ending a monopoly by Japan's 10 power 
utilities. 
The move was aimed at lowering electricity rates, which are much higher than 
in most Western economies. 
Yet the ratio of newcomers in the power market now stands at at only 0.2 
percent of the total. 
Enron also said that it would be necessary for Japan to set up an independent 
regulator to promote more competition in the power market. 
"It's OK if the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METT) could act as a 
regulator," he said, but added that METI's traditional relationship with 
power utilities may prevent it from being a fair regulator. 
Enron, North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, set up its 
first joint venture in Japan in 1999, named "E Power". Enron Japan itself was 
set up last May. 
In March, Enron presented plans to build a liquefied natural gas (LNG) fired 
power plant in northern Japan, aiming to become the first foreign company to 
build such a plant in Japan.

Enron Official: Japan Needs Independent Power Regulator

05/09/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan's power industry needs a strong independent 
regulator in order to become truly competitive, an Enron Japan Corp. official 
said Wednesday. 
"Japan is in a new global environment now. It requires new structures for its 
economy," said Nicholas J. O'Day, vice president at Enron Japan, a 
wholly-owned subsidiary of the Houston-based Enron Corp. (ENE).
While he said that the existing Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry might 
rise to fill the role, he expressed concerns that the ministry would be able 
to serve an impartial role given the historical relationship between it and 
the incumbent utilities. That relationship might make it difficult for the 
ministry to objectively treat new entrants to the power field, he said. 
Launched in April 2000, Enron Japan is focusing its business on areas such as 
electricity trading and marketing, and trading in weather derivatives, 
nonferrous metals and financial products. It has also said it plans to 
introduce broadband services in Japan. 
"Contrary to popular belief, Enron is not out to destroy the existing Japan 
utilities," O'Day said. 
Rather, he said, Enron maintains that increased liquidity is a vital factor 
to bring about a competitive environment. 
Enron is basing its conclusions on a report by U.S.-based Brattle Group, 
O'Day said. The consultancy was commissioned by Enron to assess the state of 
Japan's power industry and make suggestions for reform. 
The Brattle report will be released May 15 at an Enron co-sponsored seminar 
in Tokyo called, "Reassessing Power Deregulation."

UK: INTERVIEW-U.S. Williams enters Europe energy markets.
By Stuart Penson

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Williams is gearing up for a 
push into Europe's deregulating gas and power markets where it will focus on 
trying to sell its expertise in trading and risk management to local 
utilities. 
Williams will launch a European operation in London next week with an initial 
staff of 25 trading energy in the UK, German, Scandinavia and the Benelux 
region, the London unit's managing director told Reuters in an interview on 
Tuesday.
"The majority of our business will be around structured transactions to 
assist utilities in maximising the value of their assets," said Tim Loposer. 
Williams in Europe would at a later stage expand into trading crude oil and 
refined products, he said. 
GROWING BAND OF U.S. TRADERS IN EUROPE 
Williams is the latest addition to a growing band of U.S. energy companies 
setting up offices in London, a location they see as the ideal base from 
which to tap into Europe's potentially lucrative energy markets. 
Free trading in gas and power is gaining momentum across the European Union 
as markets open up to competition in line with EU directives on 
liberalisation. 
UBS Warburg in a recent report estimated profits from gas and power trading 
this year in Europe would amount to $1.9 billion, rising to $2.4 billion next 
year. 
Companies such as El Paso Energy , Duke Energy , ENRON AEP and TXU Europe are 
already building trading books in the UK and mainland Europe. 
"We are trying to differentiate ourselves from the other U.S. companies that 
have come to Europe," said Loposer. "We are not just a trader and we are not 
a utility, or a significant owner of generation," he said. 
Unlike some of its U.S. rivals, Williams was not planning to acquire physical 
assets, such as power stations, in Europe, said Loposer. 
"What we are looking for are incumbent utilities which are looking for a 
partner to help extract value from their assets," he said. 
"We take care of the physical commodity risk as well as the financial risks, 
we are very comfortable doing this," said Loposer, adding the strategy in 
Europe essentially would mirror the company's approach in the U.S. 
Williams approach will be based on the use of structured deals, or 
combinations of different trading tools like futures and options. 
Loposer said the company also would look to bring to Europe experience from 
the U.S. market of tolling deals, which involve delivering fuel to power 
stations and then marketing the power generated. 
SOUTHERN EUROPE AN EARLY TARGET 
Loposer said his team already was targeting Spain and Italy in its search for 
risk management contracts. 
"We are very close to some announcements, there are three or four deals that 
may come through," he said. 
"Clearly southern Europe has strong growth," said Loposer. "The divestments 
are happening there and the fundamentals are fairly strong. That said, we 
have learned that things can change overnight," he added.

INDIA: Enron moves execs families out of India - paper.

05/09/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 9 (Reuters) - Families of executives overseeing U.S. energy giant 
Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power Company (DPC) project in India are leaving 
the country, possibly signalling an intention to terminate the nearly 
complete $2.9 billion project, an India newspaper said on Wednesday. 
The Times of India said the children of Enron executives had been pulled out 
of the American School in Bombay as their families were being relocated to 
Singapore.
It also said security around the expatriate executives had been tightened, 
and personal bodyguards assigned to senior executives. 
But the unsourced report said it was not clear if the decision to move the 
families out of Bombay was made by Houston-based Enron, or reflected personal 
decisions made by the executives themselves. 
A spokesman for Dabhol Power Co, the operator of the nearly complete 2,184 MW 
power plant south of Bombay, told Reuters it was company policy not to 
comment on administrative and personnel matters. 
The newspaper said security had been tightened because "there is likely to be 
a tremendous backlash against representatives of the U.S.-based energy 
company" if the project was terminated. 
It said "more than 15,000 jobs in Dabhol will be lost if a decision is taken 
either to terminate the project or stop construction on Phase II". 
The project is mired in controversy after the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board (MSEB) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the 
giant plant, saying it is too costly. 
MSEB has also defaulted on monthly payments to DPC for the electricity it has 
taken, forcing the company's board last month to authorise the management to 
terminate the contract.

India: Dabhol: MSEB denies capacity underutilisation

05/09/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 8. OFFICIALS of the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), 
in a presentation made before the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory 
Commission (MERC), today refuted claims that the board underutilised its own 
capacity to justify power purchase from Enron's Dabhol Power Company. 
Members of Prayas, a non-government organisation, in a petition filed with 
MERC, had accused MSEB of flouting merit order dispatch of load shedding to 
justify DPC phase II.
They had also said the State would have 2000 MW of excess power if hydro 
power was fully utilised and MSEB's Uran plant was used at full capacity. 
MSEB officials explained that the board could not use hydro electricity 
beyond its current capacity. 
"DPC power was drawn by and large to remedy low frequency conditions as the 
supply from other sources was not sufficient," a senior MSEB official said in 
his presentation. 
The officials said the Uran plant was being underutilised due to lack of LNG 
availability. 
The use of furnace oil as feedstock would cost the board Rs 16,000 per tonne, 
resulting in per unit costs of Rs 4, the official said. 
The board was already making optimum use of its thermal power capacity. 
According to an official, 95 per cent of DPC power was used to sustain 
frequency as per the Indian Electricity Grid Code. 
"Load shedding has always been carried out in consultation with the Western 
Regional Load Dispatch Centre," he said.

NEW DELHI, May 9 Asia Pulse - The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) 
has said that there is no pressure from the federal government on the state 
government to continue its agreement with US energy giant Enron-promoted 
Dabhol Power Company (DPC). 
MSEB in a letter to the federal governemt denied news reports which suggested 
that that the deal with Enron could have been scrapped by the state 
government but for "pressure" from the federal government.

MSEB ropes in HC judge as arbitrator

THE MSEB on Tuesday appointed a former Bombay High Court judge ML Pendse as 
its arbitrator, reports Girish Kuber in Mumbai. The formal announcement about 
Mr Pendses appointment is expected by Wednesday.
Enron already has appointed its arbitrator. According to government sources 
once the two parties complete their formalities for appointing an arbitrator, 
the case will be tried in London. According to the PPA the dispute resolution 
clause states that disputes should be referred to an expert for technical 
matters. 
And in other cases, the resolution should be by reference to arbitration to 
be conducted under the New York Convention of 1958 and to be located in 
London. 
MSEB had delayed the monthly payments of electricity bills from October last 
year and subsequently defaulted on payments, claiming that the cost of power 
produced by DPC was exorbitant. It also slapped two penalty bills of around 
Rs 800 crore on Enron for failing to generate electricity within the 
stipulated time period of three hours. 
Enron subsequently has invoked state guarantees, counter-guarantees and 
political force majeure, and then went on to invoke the arbitration clause. 
Meanwhile, the Madhav Godbole panel is yet to receive the names of the 
members of Enrons lenders and share holders who will be attending the first 
meeting with the state government panel on May 11. 
The Godbole panel has been appointed with a mandate to renegotiate the PPA 
with DPC. 
Though Enron has accepted the invitation, it has made it clear that it is 
meeting the panel as a courtesy and it should not seen as its willingness to 
renegotiate the PPA.

SJM demands probe into Enron deal
The Times of India News Service

The Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an arm of the RSS, has demanded a judicial 
probe into the Enron deal, while investigating the role of politicians and 
bureaucrats in the controversy-ridden power project. 
Ramesh Seth, convener of SJM, Mumbai and Anil Gachke, convener of SJM's 
national action group on power, have alleged that while examining the 
feasibility of the project, inflated and fabricated figures of demand for 
power were given by those in power.
When pointed out that this would mean an examination of leaders like Gopinath 
Munde, Sharad Pawar and Balasaheb Thackeray, Gachke said that a probe should 
be instituted irrespective of political affiliations. 
Gachke said the SJM would not budge from their stand of cancellation of the 
deal. Seth, a qualified engineer, had predicted on behalf of the Manch that 
Enron power would cost Rs seven per unit in 1996, which was way higher than 
the actual cost of power. 
To make people aware of the issue, they have organised a seminar 'Enron
-review and thereafter', which will be held today at Ghia Hall, Kala Ghoda at 
2 pm.

Plans for more power from Uran unlikely: MSEB
Business Times Bureau

05/09/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra State Electricity Board has stated to the Maharashtra 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) that MSEB's plans to generate more 
power from its idle Uran plant in order to avoid expensive Dabhol power, are 
unlikely to materialise due to the high costs involved. 
In a hearing that took place on Tuesday, against a petition filed by SR 
Paranjpe, MSEB officials made it clear to the Commission that it has to pay 
Rs 16,000 per tonne for furnace oil to Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilisers 
(RCF) which makes the power costlier from Uran.
This was because as per the plans worked out by the Union ministry of 
petroleum and natural gas, MSEB can avail of additional natural gas from GAIL 
by diverting the gas allocated to RCF. In turn, the Board is expected to pay 
up the differential price to RCF. But MSEB, in its reply to a question during 
the hearing, stated that fuel (furnace oil) for RCF costs Rs 16,000 per tonne 
and if the differential price is to be borne by it, then the cost of power 
generated from the Uran plant will be over Rs 4 per unit. This, the Board 
claims, will make it an unviable proposal to be implemented. 
However, the petitioner has challenged this claim made by MSEB and MERC has 
asked to present written submissions before the Commission this week. 
MSEB's Uran plant has a capacity of 913 MW, but only around 300 MW is being 
generated due to lack of natural gas. This arrangement, initiated by the 
ministry to offer more natural gas to MSEB, follows a representation made by 
CM Vilasrao Deshmukh last month. 
Currently, MSEB has been allocated only 1.6 mmtpa natural gas from GAIL since 
the output from ONGC's Bombay High has depreciated in the recent past, said 
sources. Union petroleum minister Ram Naik had earlier announced that the 
ministry would take all efforts to allocate more natural gas to Uran. 
The petition had challenged that MSEB had violated the merit order despatch 
and purchased more power from Enron violating the limits set by MERC in its 
May 5 order. The Commission will issue an order soon after the petitioners 
submit their affidavits responding to MSEB's reply to the charges made 
against them.

Enron: Preparing for pull out?
Pradipta Bagchi

05/09/2001
The Times of India
Copyright (C) 2001 The Times of India; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MUMBAI: Is Enron preparing to pull out of India? Officially, the answer's 
``no''. But in a significant move, the families of the expatriate executives 
working in its subsidiary, the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), have been shifted 
out of Mumbai and relocated to Singapore. 
In addition, the security cover for expatriate executives working in DPC has 
been tightened, including personal bodyguards for senior executives.
According to sources, the families have been shifted from Mumbai and the 
children of these executives studying in the American School in Bandra-Kurla 
have been pulled out. An American School spokesperson refused to comment when 
asked about this. 
An Enron spokesperson, when contacted, also declined to comment. "It is our 
corporate policy not to comment on personnel and administrative matters," he 
said. 
It is not clear if the decision to move the families out of Mumbai was taken 
at the corporate level in DPC or whether the decision has been a personal one 
taken by the expatriate executives themselves. 
About 15 expatriate officials are working in DPC as part of the management 
and operations team. 
According to the sources, uncertainty over the fate of the $2 billion project 
has led Enron's expatriate executives to move their families out of Mumbai. 
This is because in the event of the power project being terminated in the 
next few weeks, expatriate officials feel that there is likely to be a 
tremendous backlash against representatives of the US-based energy company. 
Over 15,000 jobs in Dabhol will be lost if a decision is taken either to 
terminate the project or to stop construction work on phase II of the DPC 
project. 
The security around the expatriate officials still working to salvage the 
project in Mumbai has been tightened. In addition, some of the senior DPC 
officials have been allocated security personnel to act as their bodyguards. 
The Enron spokesperson said that the company had just moved its premises to a 
new building in the Bandra-Kurla complex and the security needs of the 
company have changed. "We have no extra security than is absolutely 
necessary", he maintained. 
It is unclear what will be the fate of the project, with Kenneth Lay, the 
chairman of Enron Corp, using his veto power to dissuade the Enron board from 
terminating the project earlier this week. 
A team of Enron executives is scheduled to meet the government next week to 
discuss the reccommendations of the Godbole Committee, set up to review the 
power purchase agreement by the Maharashtra government.

Dabhol lenders willing to back PPA termination
Our Banking Bureau Mumbai

The Maharashtra government's tough stance, combined with the Centre's silence 
on honouring its counter-guarantee for December last year which has been 
invoked by the Dabhol Power Company, has left the lenders to the project with 
no choice but to say yes to DPC's plan of serving the power purchase 
agreement termination notice. 
"If the governments (Centre and state) do not come forward to resolve the 
crisis, it will be difficult for the lenders to convince the company to keep 
the decision of terminating the PPA in abeyance. We had got a three-week 
reprieve and we will not be in a position to stretch it further," said a 
source among the lenders. The deadline expires on May 15.
At the DPC board meeting in London in the last week of April, the resolution 
on PPA termination was passed by a 7:1 vote. The lone voice of dissent was 
that of the representative of the Industrial Development Bank of India on the 
DPC board. 
The three Maharashtra State Electricity Board representatives were not 
allowed to vote since they were an interested party. 
"At best, the lender's representative will abstain from voting at the next 
meeting. We have no moral rights to oppose the move," said another source. 
The only positive development for which the lenders can claim credit for is 
MSEB's payment of Rs 134 crore, that too, under protest. 
"The escrow account with Canara Bank has not yet been activated. A string of 
clearances has been pending with the state government. The Centre is also not 
willing to honour its counter-guarantee. The lenders have not been able to 
achieve any thing," sources added. 
DPC had invoked the political force majeure clause in its contract with the 
board. MSEB is now arguing that the invocation of this clause has absolved 
DPC of all its liabilities. 
The DPC board authorised the managing director of Enron India to issue a 
notice for terminating the power purchase agreement to MSEB and the state 
government. 
Serving of the notice requires backing of the lenders who have an exposure of 
about $200 crore in the project.

Prize Petroleum eyes Enron stake in Panna, Mukta
Sidhartha New Delhi

Copyright (c) Business Standard

Prize Petroleum Company Ltd has decided to enter the oil and gas production 
sector by trying to acquire the 30 per cent Enron equity in the Panna, Mukta 
and Tapti fields in western offshore and has valued Enron's equity at around 
Rs 600 crore. 
Prize Petroleum, in which Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) holds 50 
per cent equity, will invest Rs 1,900 crore in the project. Of this, Rs 1,300 
crore will be the debt component and the balance will be in the form of 
equity.
Prize Petroleum, in which ICICI has 45 per cent stake and HDFC 5 per cent, is 
in talks with a number of banks to raise the debt portion of the investment. 
Sources told Business Standard that a substantial portion of the debt has 
already been finalised and the balance is expected to be clinched shortly. 
This will be Prize Petroleum's maiden foray into the oil sector. Its 
promoters had decided to go in for only the discovered fields where risks are 
low. As a result, it refrained from participating in the two rounds of 
exploration acreage offered under the new exploration licensing policy. 
Of late, Enron has been uncomfortable operating the three offshore fields 
which had been awarded to the Enron-Reliance consortium in 1995. Late last 
year, it announced its intention to pull out of the project and invited bids 
to farm out its portion of the equity. 
The award of the three fields to the consortium was the subject of prolonged 
controversies, both inside and outside Parliament. It was ultimately cleared 
by the Supreme Court when the apex court rejected a public interest 
litigation against the award. 
An estimated $696 million has been spent on the development of Panna and 
Mukta. It is learnt that the consortium has put up three well-head platforms 
in the two fields which are estimated to have 146 million barrels of oil 
reserves. Tapti is primarily a gas field. 
ONGC holds 40 per cent stake in this project with Reliance and Enron holding 
30 per cent equity each.

Dear all,

I'm deeply grateful to you all for your generous help and contribution to our 
project of having Japan's Nikkei Business magazine carry a "Enron 
Cover-Story" in its April 9th edition.

I received the magazine's April-9 issue today, and confirmed Enron was 
carried as a real cover-story with 16 pages in it. It uses 8 pages to cover 
Enron and Enron Japan, and uses another 8 pages to discuss other 
electricity-deregulation related topics in Japan. The deregulation-related 
parts also include stories which are very much supportive to Enron Japan's 
messages - such as Japan's electricity prices are 2-3 times higher than the 
international average.

The headline of "Enron Arrives" with Enron Logo is on the magazine's front 
page, and photos of Enron building and others that we provided are nicely 
used in the article. 

The article itself is more or less balanced one which is good enough to 
introduce Enron to the Japanese audience, though the reporter uses ironic 
expressions here and there. The article also includes a column on California 
crisis with the jump headline of "the cause of the California problem is not 
deregulation, but is miserable design of regulation."

Thanks to your contribution, I believe this project proved a great success, 
and the article will successfully raise Enron's visibility in Japan, while 
our commercial staff will be able to show this high-profile magazine to their 
potential customers and business partners. 

Thank you so much again for your time and help, and I will send you full 
translations of the article early next week.

I hereby attached some of scanned photocopies of the article.

warm regards,
Mika

	Attached is the latest projection of LDP's success in the upper house elections to be held July 29th.  As indicated, although the LDP will likely retain control due to Koizumi's continuing popularity, the real test of restructuring resolve will start after the election.

Mark,

As foreshadowed last week, we gave a presentation to Mark Palmer this morning 
on the proposed Enron Japan website. Mark will be briefing Steve Kean 
tomorrow. We ran through a few background slides set out in the presentation 
and then went through the development site - dev.enron.co.jp. A copy of the 
presentation is attached.



In broad terms, we covered the following:

Why we are building the site
Who we are targeting
Reinforced that the site is commercially focused -  not brochure ware
Reinforced that the amount of material on the site is manageable and that we 
had procedures in place to regularly update the site
Sought ongoing support for new material.

I attach first drafts of articles which we propose including in the 
regulatory section . You can also view these articles in draft on the 
website  -  entry via the homepage pictures or in the Japan Market page.

 We clearly need to conform the graphs and recheck the facts and figures with 
a fine tooth comb. With that in mind, I would welcome your input on the 
content and the list of proposed future articles - set out on page 8 of the 
presentation.



We are proposing to have the website up and running by mid October with a 
view to launching the site to the public on 31 October, the date of the 
office opening. Between now and then we need to tidy up the drafts, translate 
them and then get sign off from PR, legal and Enron's web master.

I will try to give you a call  later today to briefly discuss.

kind regards
