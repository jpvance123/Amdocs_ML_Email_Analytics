Anne,
 I have incorporated the changes you requested in the above confirmations.  
We deleted the language "and Enron confirms the nomination" in the third 
paragraph of OTHER in the Spot Confirm and replaced it with "and Enron 
receives the notification of the nomination at least 30 minutes prior to the 
1st GISB nomination cycle deadline,".  
 If these are in order, please print 2 originals of each, have them signed, 
and forward them to Grand Oh at the Calgary office for his follow-up so that 
they can be executed by Enron.  
 Please do not hesitate to call if you have any further questions.

Dan,
If  we have a full requirements contract with no minimums can they choose not 
to run their plant and therefore not take any gas?
South Hampton Refining has requested this for January.  Can you give me some 
feedback.

Thanks,
Gary

That is not right, even if it is A-, we still need credit langauge.  We do 
not need credit language if we are putting in a Master Sales Agreement.  I 
thought Stacy used the Master Firm Sales contract.

I will send up a credit worksheet for this counterparty.

We need to do a master purchase sale agreement because we would be buying  
back any quantities they obligated themselves to buy but failed to buy.  I 
did not know that we still used the single purpose sale agreement or that we 
had an approved form for such.  Do I understand you that since they are A- 
rated we need no credit language in the master and no triggering events.  
Please  confirm!!!!!

We are only selling gas to them, the credit is rated A- by S&P, do you need a 
Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement, or just a Master Firm Sale Agreement.  
Let me know if you still need a credit worksheet.

Molly,
 When you brought me the resumes last week, you indicated that you had 
screened certain of the applicants and that Janette had certain ideals 
concerning the group.  I have had the resumes reviewed by Harry Collins, 
Carlos Sole, and myself and would like your opinion regarding the following 
applicants:

 Vanessa G. Griffin She is the current temp that is filling in for this 
position.
 Mary G. Martinez Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
 Esmeralda Gonzales I believe that Mary Cook has talked to her on more than 
one occasion.
 Sheryle E. Malek
 M. Denise Keauquier
 Maggie Valles
 Mary Lou Browder Enron employee whose group has been disbanded.
Additionally, Travis McCullough has been lobbying for us to talk to the temp 
that is currently filling the position for which he has hired his old 
secretary.

 If the foregoing list is okay, we would like to start the interview process 
Wednesday afternoon.  I have suggested to Harry and Carlos, that we jointly 
interview each applicant.  If this is acceptable, I will obtain access to a 
conference room for this purpose.

 Please let me know if there are any problems relating to anyone on the above 
list.

I have reviewed the pro-forma May 17, 2000 draft of the Gas Purchase Contract 
provided to you by the subject party.  The only item that has to be changed 
is the second sentence of 22.2 relating to venue in Cook County, Illinois.  
This sentence needs to be deleted.  Enron would prefer to be the confirming 
party in sections 2.2 and 2.3; however, that is our preference but we can 
agree to let the other party be the confirming party when necessary.  Please 
get with your counterparty and let me know how you would like to proceed.

		 Subject: Brazos VPP - Open issues


Tax Issues

I have spoken with my tax partner, T. Hardie, about a couple of issues.
First is whether we should increase the general partner's share from .0001%
to .0025% in order to reduce a possible risk that Brazos VPP Limited
Partnership might somehow not be treated as a partnership for tax purposes.
T. does not feel strongly about this (in part because the consequences
should not be adverse) and, unless Kevin desires otherwise, I think we
should leave the percentage at .0001%.  (Any tax law with respect to the
minimum .0025% level is probably obsolete now that we have "check-the-box"
elections for tax treatment as a partnership.)  Nora advises me that Stan
is fine with this from an accounting perspective.

The second tax issue is whether Agave, as depositor under the Trust
Agreement, can be tax matters partner for the Trust (which will also elect
to be taxed as a partnership).  Since only a partner can be tax matters
partner, it appears that one of the Class B Certificateholders -- i.e.,
Bank of America -- must be the tax matters partner.  The Servicer can of
course assist with preparation of income tax filings.

Balancing Agreement

Attached below is a revised Balancing Agreement, with the changes discussed
on Monday night by Nora, Tim, Teresa, Bob and me.  The principal change is
to add an indemnity section to this Agreement in place of the indemnity we
want to delete from the Participation Agreement that Bracewell Patterson
has prepared.  This indemnity is based on the Term Sheet and is
considerably narrower, but since we did not discuss it specifically, please
review it carefully.  Please pay attention to the note following the
definition of "Servicer Fee" that suggests that the LIBOR breakage costs
and capital adequacy costs be moved to the new indemnity section.  Nora and
I think that this would be more appealing to the Banks, but Stan may prefer
to have this built into the Servicing Fee.

(See attached file: Balancing Agreement Ver 5 from 4.doc)

Physical Sales Contracts

One of our biggest challenges to a quick closing is getting everyone to
agree on some important features of the master gas and oil purchase/sale
agreements.  The term sheet given to the Banks says the following:

     A.   With respect to each Production Payment under which Brazos
     expects to receive deliveries of natural gas in kind, Brazos shall
     enter into a confirmation under the NGPSA with ENA whereby ENA or ERAC
     shall (1) purchase all gas or oil delivered to the Company in kind
     under such Production Payment and (2) pay floating prices for such gas
     or oil.  The floating prices will be swapped into pre-determined fixed
     prices via an Energy Price Swap Agreement.

     B.   Brazos will dedicate to ENA or ERAC all Production Payment gas or
     oil which is delivered under the Production Payments documents.

     C.   The quantities of gas or oil purchased each month shall consist
     of all gas or oilactually delivered in kind to Brazos during such
     month under the Production Payment.  ENA and ERAC will be notified
     monthly in advance of the amount of gas or oil expected to be
     delivered at each delivery point.

     D.   If the actual quantity of Production Payment hydrocarbons
     delivered to Brazos is less than the scheduled quantity of
     hydrocarbons to be delivered (the "Scheduled Volumes"), and the
     producer has not delivered adjustment quantities of Production Payment
     hydrocarbons to satisfy such deficiency, the Servicer (i.e., Agave,
     the new Enron subsidiary guaranteed by Enron Corp.) will make a
     mandatory advance equal to the value of such deficiency at the
     applicable ENA or ERAC price.

     E.   As consideration for the mandatory advance, Brazos will assign to
     the Servicer the right to receive the Adjustment Quantities (or cash)
     that Brazos is entitled to receive under the Production Payment
     documents related to such delivery under the Production Payment.

In analyzing the physical contracts, and all other components of this deal,
it is important to remember that one purpose of the deal is to lock in, for
at least the 97% debt component of the total financing, a cash flow stream
that amortizes the debt over the entire term of each Production Payment.
The pieces of the deal -- the oil and gas accruing to the Production
Payment, the physical sales contracts, and the swaps -- have to fit
together for the entire life of each Production Payment.

It is also important to remember that if there is a mismatch in cash flows,
it will most likely be made up by payments from Enron Corp. under its
guaranty of Agave's mandatory "balancing" advances.  So it behooves Enron,
as well as the Banks, to make sure that the pieces of the deal fit
together.

It therefore seems to me that the physical contracts need to have the
following features:

1.   the physical contracts need to cover all of the production accruing to
each Production Payment during the life of that Production Payment,
including both scheduled quantities and adjustment quantities.  Therefore
there can be no minimum or maximum limits on quantities taken, and the
right to terminate the physical contracts must be limited to a real
melt-down situation.  It is probably misleading to talk about the scheduled
amounts being on a firm basis.

2.   the physical contracts need to match the commodity price swaps that
ENA will be providing for the scheduled amounts of production, with
floating prices for these scheduled amounts that are identical to the
floating swap prices.  Therefore the Contract Prices for the scheduled
amounts of gas need to key off of Inside FERC and the Contract Prices for
the scheduled amounts of oil need to key off of NYMEX WTI, in each case
with any agreed basis differentials.

3.   the physical contracts need to price the adjustment quantities in a
way that causes the adjustment quantities to generate enough cash to repay
Agave/Enron for any mandatory balancing advances.  The way to do this is to
price any deliveries in excess of the scheduled amounts at the Index Prices
contained in the production payment conveyances.  The Index Prices for gas
in the two existing deals are Gas Daily prices and for oil are NYMEX WTI
less differentials.

4.   the physical contracts need to match the timing of the conveyances for
adjustment quantities.  This is daily for gas deliveries and monthly for
oil deliveries.

5.   the physical contracts need to have a cover formula that protects both
ENA/ERAC and Agave/Enron.  The present formula in the Enfolio contract says
that ENA pays the Contract Price for the scheduled quantities that are
delivered and that Brazos pays the product of the shortfall in scheduled
quantities times the positive remainder, if any, of the Index Price minus
the Contract Price.  We need to change this last feature to say that Brazos
pays this remainder, if positive, but that Brazos also gets a credit is
this remainder is negative.  Tim Proffitt can explain the math to anyone
that wants to understand it, but the basic idea is that if there is a
shortfall, Brazos buys gas from ENA at the Index Price to cover the
shortfall and then ENA pays the Contract Price for the full scheduled
amount.

6.   the contracts need to do away with any concept of frequent trading
over the phone.  Each Production Payment should generate only one written
confirmation.

7.   the contracts need to be clear that netting occurs over all
transactions.  This should protect ENA and ERAC against Brazos owing them
money for one Production Payment where production has substantially shut
down and not having the ability to pay.

In light of the above, we also need to consider whether we are better off
starting with the modern Enfolio form that is designed for true commercial
transactions or whether it makes more sense to add the points described
above to the old Cactus form.

Just to clarify, are we all putting the documents together for ourselves and
faxing execution pages with originals to follow?  Or am I to wait to receive

Michael,
     I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two
changes which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are
signing.  These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001
and the left over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America
Corp.'s address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment
Document and have it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the
fax numbers for each party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is
(713)646-3490.

Everyone;

Attached is a revised assignment agreement which we hope you will find
satisfactory.

Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and

Dan,  The only other thing I can think of is taking a security interest in 
the assets we are financing, if we are concerned about these guys being a 
credit risk.  We did this with the MTG deal.  I have a form of mortgage 
agreement which works with this type of deal.  I would guess credit needs to 
make that call.  Let me know if you want the form.

Subject: Quantum Gathering Agreement

Dan,
 Please check the revised agreement to see that I have included all that is 
necessary.  Since Quantum is doing the work for themselves, I did not include 
the Construction Agreement.  Please call if you have any questions.  I will 
forward to Gerald to see if he thinks I need to include any other items.

Yes,
 We are sending them our form of master and preparing our form of GISB.  We 
will incorporate some of their 
GISB addendum items, but not all.  I will let you know when we get a

This is a day for celebration as Houston Pipe Line Company (HPL) officially
joins the American Electric Power family.

I'm both excited and thrilled to welcome  you to the AEP team--excited by
the new opportunities this relationship brings and thrilled by the
potential to do great things together.

As the newest member of the AEP family, you are joining 22,000 fellow
employees who contribute to an exciting, energetic company with diverse
resources and enormous possibilities for their application.  HPL helps
strengthen AEP's winning formula of successfully combining energy,
information and people to forge a bright future grounded in human talent, a
strong asset base and participation in high-growth businesses.  We are
very pleased that HPL will be a major player in our immediate goal to
become a top five gas marketer, not only in volume but in market presence
as well.

We're already in the process of integrating the business practices of our
two organizations and that will continue over the coming months.  We hope
to accomplish this process as smoothly as possible.  Your patience and
support during this period will be very important and much appreciated.

For those of you located in our downtown office, I hope you'll  come to the
conference room on the 15th floor at 11:30 a.m. for a welcome luncheon
barbecue!  Unfortunately, my personal schedule will prevent me from joining
you for today's celebration, but Dwayne Hart of our Energy Services group
will be on hand to offer a personal welcome.  But rest assured, I look
forward to meeting and working with you in the days and weeks ahead.

Again, welcome to the AEP team.  Let the celebration begin!

John F. Norris

I apologize if anyone has inadvertently been left off of the distribution 
list.  Please pass on if you know of someone who should receive it.  Thank 
you for your help.

Charlotte, thank you for your E:mail of March 3, 2000.  

Firstly, I would like to apologize for my tardiness in responding to your 
various voicemails, but I trust that you will appreciate that there are many 
pressing matters which must be dealt with on an ongoing basis.  

Secondly, by way of background, the form of trading agreement which PG&E Core 
executed with Enron North America Corp. (which I understand was negotiated 
over a considerable period of time), was only provided to me recently and 
without my knowledge of its context.  For example, I was not aware that the 
trading agreement was, in essence, the same form executed between PG&E Core 
and Enron North America Corp., nor that it was the result of lengthy 
negotiations.  In any event, there may be a  fallacy (if I may use that term) 
in assuming that the terms and conditions of the agreement agreed to with 
Enron North America Corp. can be simply transposed to Enron Canada Corp.  For 
example, Enron Canada Corp., although a wholly owned subsidiary of Enron 
North America Corp., is a separate corporate and origination entity with 
separate commercial and legal contracting requirements.  Although it is fair 
to say that Enron Canada Corp.'s contracting requirements in large part 
mirror those of Enron North America Corp., there can be matters of 
significance where they differ.  Further, although we would tend to adopt the 
approach taken by our parent counterparts in negotiating a document, as a 
result of different internal reporting requirements, a negotiated position 
agreed to by Enron North America Corp. may not necessarily be agreed to by 
Enron Canada Corp.  Finally, there are operational, market, commercial, 
taxation and legal differences which often vary between Canadian and U.S. 
jurisdictions which simply mandate changes to the agreement.  These, for 
example, can include, applicable indexes, index reporting, units of 
measurement, business day and payment date concepts, currency, energy content 
measurement, applicable taxes, applicable insolvency law and provisions, 
compliance with applicable laws and regulations, transaction and confirmation 
procedures, nomination and delivery procedures, the scope and consequences of 
force majeure, events of default, dispute resolution and governing law.

In short, Enron Canada Corp. will need to review the agreement for its own 
account and make sure that the foregoing are adequately addressed.  As 
always, we will try to do so as expeditiously as possible, and with a view to 
minimizing our comments or concerns.  We just have not yet simply had the 
opportunity to do so.  

I have passed the agreement along to my colleague, Mark Powell, who is 
available at 403-974-6708, and Mark will get back to you after he has had an 
opportunity to review the agreement.  As I noted, we will attempt to complete 
this review with as little disruption to the form agreed to between PG&E Core 
and Enron North America Corp.  

Regards, 

Peter C.M. Keohane
Assistant General Counsel and Secretary

Peter:
As we have been playing telephone tag,  I thought an e-mail might benefit.

Our executed Agreement with Enron North America Corp. was negotiated with
Dan Hyvl (Houston), it was my understanding when we began negotiations (with
Dan) that such provisions negotiated in the Enron (US) agreement would serve
for the Enron Canada Agreement.  Two originals of the Enron Canada Agreement
were sent to Dan Hyvl.  Dan indicated he had forwarded the agreement to you
for final review prior to execution.

I have attached the Enron agreement for your review (changes noted in blue
were initiated by Enron (US).  We are anxious to execute our agreement with
Enron Canada as this would conclude years of pending negotiations and
expedite our opportunity for trading via EnronOnline.

Please call/e-mail to discuss.

Senior Hyvl,

Does the following correspond to your voice mail message from
last Friday?  I believe that I was able to follow it pretty closely.

HPL,  ON  BEHALF  OF ITS OFFICERS, AGENTS, BONDING COMPANIES, EMPLOYEES AND

Thanks for the red-line version.  Here are my comments:

? In paragraph 10.1, a triggering event would allow close out netting of all 
transactions under this agreement and any other agreements between the 
parties.  And then in paragraph 10.4, it retiturates this point and expands 
on it by bringing in all amounts owed by all affiliates of both parties.  
This is pretty vague.  Historically, only amounts owed by the defaulting 
party to that of the non-defaulting party and its affiliates have been 
included.  Can we combine the effect of this within a single paragraph.  That 
way, we're not speaking of the same issue within two different sections.
? In paragraph 10.1, cross-default seems a bit vague.  What I was trying to 
say was, "If any indebtedness in excess of $50MM and $100MM, resepctively 
have become or is capable of becoming accelerated" and then expressly define 
indebtedness to include all borrowed monies, accounts payable, and financial 
deriviative transactions.  Without expansion, i believe indebtedness is 
typically meant to include only bank debt.
? If we made them reference Utilicorp United, Inc. as a specified entity, 
then we could tie all terms, conditions, and support back to them 
indirectly.  Could we take a look at amending the contract to accomplish 
this.  It would really strengthen the contract.
? I am surprised they did not tie any guaranty support from Enron Corp. to 
this contract.  They missed this one.
? I am ok with the 2 day LC turn around under a triggering event, although I 
do not like item c - "be unable to pay its debts as they fall due" - I would 
like to strike this line.

thats it.

I am available for a confernce call should they desire to speak on this 
further.

thanks
brant

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these 
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.

Grant, 
 I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, 
please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature 
by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to 
handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of 
incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a 
fully executed contract for your files.
 Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of 
the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your 
transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for 
giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for 
its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if 
Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and 
Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO 
notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such 
failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make 
their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled 
volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  
the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I 
can verify with the transport group.

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Dan,

Attached is the Clark County confirm you made for me with some minor changes 
(volume term price).  Let me know if it still looks OK.

Thanks,

Dan -

I received the following Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement for Ormet 
Primary Aluminum  Corp., via Craig Breslau.  The document was forwarded to my 
attention for approval of some additional credit-related language that was 
included specifically for the transaction currently being executed.

I want to strike this language from the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
The language to which I refer is found in Article 4.3, "Collateral 
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold", and is highlighted in blue:

"Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and the Customer agree to 
negotiate in good faith a netting agreement that will eliminate or reduce the 
need for a letter of credit to be supplied by Customer and that until such 
netting agreement is executed by the parties, a Letter of Credit under this 
provision shall not be required."

This language is intended specifically for this transaction, so I will make 
sure that it is written into the confirm, but I do not want it to be included 
in the Master agreement.

Could you please ensure that this is removed from the Master prior to sending 
to Ormet Primary Aluminum Corp. for execution?


Thanks,

Jay

At Craig's request, I am forwarding the final revsion to the Ormet Firm 
Purchase/Sale agreement.  The last change is additional language in Section 
4.3 and is the result of discussions between Enron and Ormet credit.  The new 
language is in blue.

Please get back to me with any comments as quickly as possible so that Enron 
can move forward with Koch Gateway.

Ina, Craig asked that you forward a copy to Jay in credit so that he can 
review the new language as well.

Thanks to you both,
Mike

Mr. Hyvl,

Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until
we have a fully executed contract, so it looks like I will have to take that
portion out of the contract.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Do you have a specific answer to the franchise question below?  I remember 
that it was an issue in the Baytown lawsuit, but did not hear the final 
aspect of that argument.  In light of the final decision, is that an issue 
today?  Please keep Candy in this loop, so that she can understand which

I am familiar with the ultimate customer, NGO and know their buyer, as they 
are wholly owned sub of OxyChem.  They would be more than happy to discuss a 
direct connect to HPL. 

BUT, I recollect from a couple of years ago the possibility of franchise 
problems .... i.e. that our position was NOT to pursue a direct connect to 
NGO as this might place HPL in a position of exposure with respect to the 
franchise tax to the City of Baytown.

We discussed this project in our staff meeting today.  I will be talking to

we should make an effort to serve this customer directly without Entex 
involvement.  Exxon advised that we would need to move our line by Sept. 2001

As I believe I've mentioned to both of you, ENA has entered into an 
Electronic Trading Agreement that clearly provides that physical gas and 
financial transactions will be governed by specified Master Agreements in 
lieu of the online GTCs.  I wanted to let you know what those underlying 
contracts are so that you can confirm that you are comfortable trading on 
DynegyDirect pursuant to their terms.

Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 1993 governs natural gas 
transactions

Master Agreement, dated January 27, 1992 governs financial transactions.

Dan,

Based on the 11/6/2000 Enron North America Corp. Deal Listing for all deals 
with flow dates between 4/1/2000 and 11/30/2000 for the three (3) HPLC Desks 
(ENA - IM Texas, HPLC - IM HPLC and HPLC - IM Wellhead), we have determined 
that there are 80 contracts which are currently held by Enron North America 
Corp. which should be reviewed for inclusion in the proposed Triple Lutz

The document looks good. Can we use this as a template for further buyback 
confirmations ?

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen

The GSA doc was apparently corrupted in transit.
All others are accessible.
Could you please resend only the GSA doc.

Thank you,

Attached below are hopefully the final versions of the related agreements.
Please print out at least three orginials of each for execution.  I should
have the recording information back by Monday on the Enernet liens which I
will include in the next version of the Mortgage exhibit as well as a
notation that the bank mortgage was subordinated to the enron mortgage.
Please call if you have any questions.

Below is the revised version of the Crude Oil Agreement, with changes from
the one you probably saw this morning.  Alan Aronowitz thought (and I
concur) that since we don't really have liquidated damages we should take
that language out of the last section.

I'll send the proposed Gas Agreement, marked from the Oil one, shortly.

Dan,

Westport Oil and Gas Company Inc has agreed to terms for Enron providing 
gathering from the inlet of screw compression to Glenrock.
I am faxing to you a term sheet so that we can get Westport a gathering 
agreement asap. You can use the latest Quantum agreement as a start.
We are NOT purchasing the gas.

Call me with questions,
Mike

Basically the intent of this condition is as follows:  On the replacement 
gas, we will purchase or sell this gas based on a GDDI but in the event that 
this index is unavailabe at the time of the transaction or the index has 
separated from the fixed price for that day then the counterparties have 
agreed that we can buy/sell on a fixed price.  In either scenerio, when ECC 
is acting as the agent, we shall be held harmless from a price exposure..


If this explanation is not clear enough... give me a call.

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Sandi,
 As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I 
believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts 
that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in 
place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also 
wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA 
wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think 
that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are 
certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, 
these being the contracts with Entex, etc., after we decide how ENA also 
wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need 
a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done.

Dan,
I am preparing the assignments of ENA contracts going into Lodisco as well as 
those going to HPL. The PSA at exhibit 4.13 (x) lists those going to Lodisco. 
Is that still accurate? If not, can you forward to me an updated list? Also, 
is there a list of those ENA contracts that are to be assigned to HPL rather 
than Lodisco? Let me know--

Thanks,
Sandi

 This relates to our meeting last Thursday when I asked Brenda if the Entex 
Gas Marketing transactions stayed with Janet Wallis.  It is my understanding 
that the Entex traders for both Entex and Entex Gas Marketing are sometimes 
the same.  I recall times when Janet would request a deal under Entex and 
then Entex would move the  transaction to Entex Gas Marketing.  They have 
also gone the other way on some deals.  
 The same is possible with Southern Union Gas Company and Mercado in 
Galveston and Port Arthur.  
 I raised the question because these may occur at or behind the city gate 
delivery point.
Brenda said that she was going to ask the business group how they wanted to 
handle Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado.

 Dan;

Thanks for your note concerning the subject agreement.  I'm wondering if it
might be more straightforward if we just replace the affected sections of
the form of contract Enron previously provided. ( In preparing the suggested
changes I followed the structure (and headings) of that form.)   With
respect to "OTHER TERMS",  I suggest that the first three paragraphs in the
last version could be replaced.

The suggested changes are reproduced below for ease of reference and use.
Note that the final paragraph anticipates the insertion of a Contract Number
by Enron.

 Regards;

 Michael Kleiner
 Law Department


TIER OF GAS:  As specified in OTHER TERMS, below.
DCQ (IN MMBTUS):  An amount between 0 MMbtu per day and 20,000 MMbtu per
day, as specified in OTHER TERMS, below.
DELIVERY POINT:   The interconnect of ANR Pipeline Co. (Joliet) and Alliance
Pipeline Limited  ("Alliance") provided that Customer will use reasonable
efforts to arrange deliveries to alternate downstream pipelines as Company
may request in accordance with the procedures specified in OTHER TERMS,
below.
.........
OTHER TERMS:

In this Agreement, "Customer's AOS" shall mean Customer's right to utilize
Authorized Overrun Service on Alliance by virtue of that agreement between
Customer and Alliance providing Customer with 51.1 MMcf per day of Alliance
firm capacity, but does not include Customer's right to utilize Authorized
Overrun Service that is announced as available to Customer after 9:00 am
Mountain Time on the Nomination Day; and

"Gas Day" has the meaning given to that term in the U.S. tariff for Alliance
pipeline.

"Nomination Day" means the business day immediately preceding a particular
Gas Day.

On each Nomination Day, by  9:00 am Mountain Time  Customer will advise
Company by telephone or voice mail whether Customer will deliver and sell
gas hereunder on the next Gas Day and the amount to be delivered in MMBtus .
That amount shall be the DCQ for the next Gas Day, in all other
circumstances the DCQ will be zero.  The decision to sell and deliver gas
hereunder shall be within Customer's sole discretion, however, Customer
agrees that it shall not utilize Customer's AOS to deliver gas to a buyer in
Chicago except to Company pursuant to this Agreement, provided that Customer
may utilize Customer's AOS for operational purposes such as and including
balancing its Alliance account.

Once DCQ for the next Gas Day has been determined as provided in the
preceding paragraph such gas shall be considered to be Tier 3 Firm Gas and
the Force Majeure provision of the Enfolio Spot General Terms and Conditions
shall not apply to such deliveries.

By 9:45 am Mountain Time on each Nomination Day  that the DCQ for the next
Gas Day is not zero, Company shall advise Customer in writing or via e-mail
of the contract numbers, associated gas volumes, and alternate downstream
pipelines, if any,  where it wishes to have the DCQ allocated on the next
Gas Day. If Company fails to provide such advice in respect of the entire
DCQ  by 9:45 am,  Company will be conclusively deemed to have allocated the
entire DCQ to Contract No. ______________.   Promptly thereafter, Customer
will place a nomination with Alliance in accordance with such allocation.

 Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with
respect to
 the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the
central
 desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been
 involved in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial
risk,
 especially given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults
to
 schedule 'A'.  My understanding was that we would all work together
on a
 reasonable efforts basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents
of
 schedule 'A' and its true enforceability does not seem to really
change the
 spirit of the agreement.
 If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the
 central desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then
I
 would not object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the
contract.

Grant,
 Attached are the two transactions that result from spliting the original 
deal.  Please advise Crestar that they need to revise the assignment document 
to reflect an agreement for Transaction No. 1 dated March 22, 2001 instead of 
March 5, 2001 and they should provide for a complete assignment of that 
Transaction No. 1. Document 2001-23acrfm relates to Transaction No. 1.  Don't 
you agree?  If you agree, please print off 2 originals each and send one of 
each to Crestar, and email a copy of each to Bob Bowen for his Confirm 
Records.

There is one revision to the volumes, they are  11,740  and 8260     rather

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

Per our discussion earlier today, here is some generic settlement language 
you might want to use:

In further consideration of the agreements, covenants and releases set forth 
herein, _____ hereby releases, acquits and discharges ___ and __________, 
together with their directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys, 
representatives, heirs, assigns, affiliates, and subsidiary and parent 
organizations from and against any and all claims, demands, obligations, 
liabilities, for causes of action, of any nature whatsoever, at law or in 
equity, relating to or arising out of the subject matter of the Pending 
Litigation, including but not limited to, any and all claims, demands, 
liabilities or causes of action asserted in the Pending Litigation or arising 
under any contract or agreement, or in connection with any project, which is 
the subject of the Pending Litigation.

If no lawsuit has been filed, you will need to make some minor adjustments.  
I hope this helps.  Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell

Richard Sanders and I talked with Elizabeth (an attorney with AEP).  She was 
not sure that their was a question that needed to be answered.  Richard 
opined that the question may have related to the effect on HPL if it lost the 
Taub lawsuit.  This suit relates to an alleged violation of the surface 
rights agreement (Collateral Agreement) which was entered into with certain 
surface owners after the Unit Agreement was signed.  Richard explained that 
if HPL lost the suit, it would lose its rights to maintain a pipeline and 
well facilities on the property subject to the lawsuit.  In that event HPL 
would have to either locate its pipeline around the property or  use its 
condemnation rights to acquire an easement across the property.  Because the 
Collateral Agreement relates to surface rights, losing those rights would not 
affect HPL's rights under the Unit Agreement and thus the Taubs would not 
have the right to drill a well to produce the gas that HPL has in storage.

We are finally nearing the end of the review. I am currently demanding a 
final response from our legal beagles on the indemnification issue since the 
two cannot come to an agreement so far.? As for the rest of the agreement, 
here are two changes that we discussed earlier on the phone:

ADD the following sentence at the end of the first paragraph in Enfolio 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement?? "This agreement and all other 
transactions are for sales of gas to the Engelhard Corporation Pasadena, 
Texas location only."

DELETE the second sentence that was added in the Daily Contract Quantity 
(DCQ) section on the Transaction agreement.?? (Seller acknowledges and agrees 
that the provisions of Section 3.4 of the ENFOLIO Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement shall not apply so long as Buyer purchases the DCQ from Seller 
under the pricing terms provided below.)?? Our lawyers found this confusing.

I apologize for our late response.? 

Hope you had an enjoyable holiday. 

Best regards 

Karen Gruber

Subject: Re: Southern Confirmation Letters  

Dan/Phil -- Good question.  Here is my quickie response.

We will not sign a binding agreement with SOCO until we know that we have the 
gas under acceptable documentation, as outlined below:

If we must deliver at Elba to satisfy a deal with SOCO, then acceptable doc's 
means that (1) Enron LNG will have final doc's with El Paso, (2) ENA will 
have a Master in place with Enron LNG, and (3) our TA with Enron LNG should 
say that they are selling to ENA subject to ENA closing/signing a subsequent 
deal with SOCO (so we can "leg into" SOCO.)

If we get alternate or secondary receipt point rights from SOCO, which means 
that we do not have to deliver at Elba, but we we can deliver from Destin, 
then contractually and physically it makes no difference if we are firm or 
not at Elba with Enron LNG.  The only problem is that we ought to be careful 
representing that we are selling Elba as primary supply source with secondary 
Destin, if we really are not going to get Elba finished.

Any further questions, let me know.  -- David

Attached please find a red-line redraft of the Confirmation Letters.  I 
understand that Enron will not sign the confirmation letters with Southern 
until Enron North America Corp. has finalized its arrangements with the Elba 
Island Terminal entity having the gas available at the tailgate of the Elba 
Island facility.  Is this correct.  If so, I do not need to make ENA's 
contract with such entity a condition precedent to the Southern Confirmation 
Letters.  Please advise.

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Alrighty. Here is a complete look at what we have 'pending' with Alagasco. 
I'm expecting a call back next week from Amy McEntire (Alagasco's attorney) 
in regards to further instruction on what to do with the stragglers 
(outstanding deals). Based on my conversations today, it appears that 
Alagasco is showing these deals on other CES contracts (contracts for which 
we are encountering a volume constraint), if we can verify this via 
confirmations (Jennifer Blay is currently researching) then the issue will be 
volume constraints rather than term dates. TAMMI, can you verify if deal #s 
242653 & 271301 are CES deals or ENA deals (there are no notes relating there 
back to CES)? If they are ENA deals, we should be able to move them over to 
the 'new' (9/1/99) Enfolio contract without the same tangles we are 
encountering with the CES continued deals. Also, can you confirm that these 
deals are not bound by a demand fee? Reason, the CES contracts stipulate 
demand fees (as listed on spreadsheet) - - - - - if the deals are ENA & do 
not have demand fees associated with them - - - - - - then they do not belong 
on the CES Ks and moving them should be easier (assuming that we are able to 
explain this to Alagasco as this will change the Confirming party & trigger a 
confirmation being sent to their offices). DAN, does all of this sound right 
to you? Depending on how Amy & Roger view things - - - - - - the move may 
just be a ENA booking issue. I'm a bit fearful that they may use this as an 
opportunity to renegotiate the demand fees associated with these long term 
deals. In addition, if they decide to allow the deals to ride on contracts 
where we encounter a volume constraint - - - - - - I'm assuming that they 
would initiate an amendment to reconciliate the contracts with the 
transactions. If they do not initiate - - - - - guess that will be a bridge 
crossed when we get there?
Anyhow, TAMMI, I hope the spreadsheet helps if Roger should call before I 
hear from Amy. DAN, I'll let you know the volume issues as soon as I get my 
hands on copies of the confirmations that should have been sent by Alagasco.
Depending on who gets contacted first - - - - - please let me know if 
anything new pops up.

Thanks all!!

Christian,
     The below documents has been modified in the manner that you
suggested.  Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated
to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be
used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been
requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested
changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.
If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2
originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to
Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any
questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895.

Per Bob Bowen's earlier request, attached, please find a listing of the 
Canadian Counterparties that currently do not have a Master Agreement in 
place.  I have noted which type of Master(s) would be appropriate based on 
the type of business currently being done on the Ontario desk with each 
Counterparty. 

 Geoff, I would be glad to meet and review this listing with you to make sure 
I have captured the correct information regarding the type of business you 
are conducting with each of these counterparties, just let me know when you 
are available.  




Please let me know if you have any questions.

Melissa,
 The maximum rate which HPL is authorized to impose for 311 transportation 
service may be established by either a rate proceeding before the FERC which 
would have to be renewed every 3 years or by using the margin component of a 
city gate rate which has been approved by the state regulatory agency.  In 
HPL's case, HPL has filed with the FERC that its rates will be the margin 
component of the City Gate Rate approved in Docket No. 592 before the Texas 
Railroad Commission.  This allows HPL to use this margin determined as 
provided in the February 8, 1974 contract between Entex and HPL as its 
maximum rate for 311 service.  That is one of the reasons that HPL continues 
to sell certain volumes of gas to Entex under that contract.   You can 
probably contact Steve VanHooser for any documentation that he may have 
concerning the applicable FERC filings if Tom Shelton does not already have 
such information.

 Please reforward your message to me after the 18th so that I can contact 
Aquila concerning where we next proceed concerning HPL's contract.

Dan,

Per our phone conversation, please contact Kathy Dirks with Aquila Energy
Marketing, Corporation regarding the final negotiations of their master
contract.  Per Kathy, this HPL contract has been in negotiations for almost
a year, and they are very close to finalizing.  Her phone number is:
816-527-1560.

Also, at yesterday's meeting regarding the various AEP Entities, you
mentioned that HPL has 311 Transportation with a Grandfathered Rate.  Do
you have any documentation regarding this arrangement, or can you refer me
to the person that could provide this?

Thank you,
Melissa Graves

Kim,
 The gas portion of the RFP does not appear to be of concern assuming we are 
willing to handle the swing in their requirements.  The RFP does require that 
we attach our contract form, which I think should be the contract draft we 
are currently negotiating together with a completed form of Transaction 
Agreement for the RFP response.  Do you agree?  I am still waiting for a 
response from the City Attorney regarding his requested changes and our 
response as to each of his points.  I called Christian Yoder for a download 
of his conversation with the City Attorney last Friday but I have yet to hear 
from Christian.  At this point I think that we need to include language in 
the RFP response that our bid is based on them executing the contract as 
attached.

Effective 2/1/01 the above mentioned CP's merged to form El Paso Merchant

Rod,
Here is another list of Canadian counterparties that need masters.  My 
understanding is that we have done trades with these counterparties in the 
last two months.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Per Bob Bowen's earlier request, attached, please find a listing of the 
Canadian Counterparties that currently do not have a Master Agreement in 
place.  I have noted which type of Master(s) would be appropriate based on 
the type of business currently being done on the Ontario desk with each 
Counterparty. 

 Geoff, I would be glad to meet and review this listing with you to make sure 
I have captured the correct information regarding the type of business you 
are conducting with each of these counterparties, just let me know when you 
are available.  




Please let me know if you have any questions. 

Thank you,

I would like to order a headset for my telephone, much like the ones that 
Taffy, Mary Helen and Carlos have.  Are you open to that and if so, will you 
approve it?  It is just a matter of ordering it through Superior Headset

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Christian,
     The below documents has been modified in the manner that you
suggested.  Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated
to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be
used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been
requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested
changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.
If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2
originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to
Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any
questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895.

Dan, the only thing I'm missing on the Enovate contract is the
notices/billing/payment page.  If you want to just email me the info, I'll
plug it in.

Thanks so much for your help.

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  Grant,
       I have incorporated the language you provided to me in
the attached
  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on
the line next to
  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's
  approval and signature.  Once the contract is fully
executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

Barry Tycholiz says that the attached is in final form and should be Raised 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Therefore, please issue this negotiated GTC confirm on ENA stationary.  Stacy 
Dickson has been working with Barry on this and I made the last changes which 
had been negotiated.  Call if you have any questions?

Barry,
 The attached document appears to be in final form.  It is ready to be put on 
ENA stationary and sent to Crestar.  If you are going to do this please send 
me a hard copy of what is sent out.  As written, the document does not need 
to be signed by either party.  If you want the ENA confirm desk to send it 
out, please let me know and I will forward it to them to send, however, in 
each case, the document will not need to be signed by either party.  Please

Grant,
 I received a fax from Michael Kleiner with Gulf Canada Resources Limited in 
behalf of Crestar Energy Marketing Corp. suggesting certain changes to the 
OTHER section of the existing transaction agreement.  I do not see that he 
copied you with any of this.  Do you know anything about it.  If not, I can

Photo Sessions for Next Pictorial Roster Set for June 19-20, August 14-15

 The Houston Bar Association has contracted with a new publisher for
the 2002 edition of the HBA Pictorial Roster, and photography sessions have
been scheduled for members who would like to have a new picture taken for
the Roster -- free of charge.
 Any member who would like to have his or her photo taken may come by
the Houston Bar Association office between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 5:00
p.m. on June 19 or June 20. Another session will be scheduled August 14 and
August 15. There is no charge for the photo, no appointment is necessary,
and the photo sessions will take only a few minutes. The Houston Bar
Association office is located downtown at 1001 Fannin, Suite 1300.
 Members may also submit their own photo for the Roster, or use an
existing photo already on file with the HBA.
 Legal Directories Publishing Company, Inc. will begin publishing
annual editions of the Pictorial Roster, rather than every two years. The
HBA hopes to have as many current photos as possible in the new Roster, so
please take advantage of this opportunity.

This foot-and-mouth virus that is sweeping throughout Europe is enough to 
make even the greatest carnivore turn into a strict vegetarian. I seriously 
doubt that it would actually come to that, but if it did, I could probably 
swing it... maybe. However, I can't vouch for Sunny and Edgar. Recently, 
JokeMistress and me ordered take out from this cool vegetarian place by us. 
We had some Soy Bean Burger left over, so I placed it down for them eat. I 
wasn't very surprised when they didn't maul it, but what I didn't expect was 
how insulted they were by my well-intended gesture. They looked at me as if 
to say, "Are you kidding us?" I told them I was and promised never to do it 
again.

DRINKING BUDDIES

A couple of drinking buddies who are airplane mechanics are in a hangar at 
JFK New York. It's fogged in and they have nothing to do. 

One of them says to the other, "Man, have you got anything to drink?" 

The other one says, "Nah, but I hear you can drink jet fuel, and it will 
kinda give you a buzz." 
So they do drink it, get smashed and have a great time, like only drinking 
buddies can. 

The following morning, one of the men wakes up and he just knows his head 
will explode if he gets up, but it doesn't. He gets up and feels good. In 
fact, he feels great! No hangover! 

The phone rings. It's his buddy. The buddy says, "Hey, how do you feel?" 

"Great", he said! "Just great"! The buddy says, "Yeah, I feel great too, and 
no hangover. That jet fuel stuff is great. We should do this more often! 

"Yeah, we could, but there's just one thing . . . " 

"What's that?" 

"Did you fart yet?" 

"No . . . " 

"Well, DON'T, 'cause I'm in Phoenix."

Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...

Mr. Wood,

As requested, Enfolio shortened and simplified the section on
Representations and Warranties.  The new language is highlighted on page 2
of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Good Morning Dan:

Hope your Thanksgiving was safe and happy.

Legal and Credit have returned the contracts from final review and the only
two edits we would ask are as follows:

Page 2 - ARTICLE 4 DEFAULTS AND REMEDIES
     4.1 Early Termination:  At the top of page 2, second column, please
delete the reference to arbitration of the Termination Payment and perhaps
use something like "good faith efforts by both parties......".

Page 1 of Appendix I - DEFINITIONS
     Following the definition for "Delivery Point(s)" and before the
definition for "Force Majeure", please include the definition for
"Financially Firm".
     "Financially Firm" shall mean that the parties have agreed that the
performance obligation of Seller to delivery and sell and Buyer to receive
and purchase is only excused if it is physically impossible for a party to
deliver or receive Gas in accordance with its obligations under a
Transaction because Gas is not available (at any price), or cannot be made
available (at any price) via transportation (at any price) to the Delivery
Point(s) to enable performance consistent with the terms of a Transaction.

Dan, please call or email me if anything is unclear and it's my
understanding that these same edits would be mirrored in both agreements,
the Enron North America one as well as the Enovate contract.  My phone
number again is 713.207.3266.

Thanks,
Ellen Dailey

before sending it to Citizens.
We hope to send the proposal to Citizens tomorrow morning after you have 
returned to the office and had an opportunity to review this e-mail.
Also, to let you kinow, Citizens Communications as of the end of 2000 held $7 
Billion in assets and had adjusted EBITDA of $509 Million on revenues of $1.8 
Billion.
Question:  What percentage chance is there that a court might set the 
indemnity aside as Jim mentioned below in the previous e-mail?

Chris,
Jim mentioned that ENA might want to consider being an additional insured 
under the insurance policy.  Any thoughts or comments?

Best regards,

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in 
the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If 
covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not 
recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable 
to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Dan,
It would probably be better to date the mortgage when signed.
Dan Bump and I talked about the date and it seems that the date here is used
as an identifier of the Enron mortgage.  If it only identifies and has no
other significance, it seems that the mortgage is sufficiently identified by
other references, i.e., GPA, GSA, property description etc, and that a date
is not necessary. Your call.

The description is simple.  There is one lease.  The lease covers all of
Section 16-48N-72W, Campbell County, WY less and except the SW SW thereof.
It would be a simple thing to attach a copy of the lease to all agreements
including the "Enron" WHGGS Mortgage.

I believe Dan Bump has a copy of the lease.  If not, I can send copies to
both you and Dan Bump.

Please email a clean copy of mortgage as modified by your redline version
and I will get the bank to execute, fax you a copy of the executed mortgage
and overnight the original to you.

Let me know by reply email what the plan is for wrapping up.

Thanks,
Doug

mortgage as being dated December 20, 1999.  Is this correct, or will the
mortgage be dated when it is signed?   Also, is the property description
the same as it is to be in the Enron mortgage document.  If so, if will
advise Wyoming counsel to speed up the record search.

Steve,
 I made the same change to both Oneok and PG&E regarding payment following 
the service month.  Is this correct.  Please check each document and if okay, 
please forward to the counterparty for their execution and return.

To All:

As a follow up to Mark's e-mail, I want to update you all on the position I 
am taking with Coastal Merchant (formerly Engage Energy US LP) as well.  Per 
the ISDA in place between ENA and Coastal Merchant, we have been margining 
them to cover there current exposure.  We are currently holding cash in 
addition to the unsecured credit line as stated in the ISDA.  Coastal does 
not want to post cash but would rather increase the guaranty to cover the 
Financial exposure.  At this time, I have told them we can not incur any 
increases in their guaranty because they are still securing Engage Energy 
Canada exposure through their physical guaranty.  Coastal has since notified 
Engage Energy and Westcoast of this issue, and have requested that Engage 
work with our legal groups to finalize the guaranty issues.  

As I understand it from Mark's e-mail below, Engage is unwilling to work with 
us to negotiate a satisfactory guaranty and physical contract.  I have made 
Coastal aware that we can not increase these guaranty's until some resolution 
has come about with Engage Canada, and we will continue to margin them for 
cash as needed.

Russell

Subject: Engage Energy Canada, L.P.

Hey Russell and Jon,

As you are aware, we have been trying to get Engage Energy Canada, L.P. 
("Engage") to execute an updated master physical firm gas purchase and sale 
agreement (an "Amended Physical Master") over the last two and a half years 
with no success.  Until this week, we had received no comments from Engage 
with respect to our suggested amendments (despite sending four distinct forms 
of amendments starting in August, 1998).

The matter came to a head in June of this year when the Credit department 
wanted to call for collateral from Engage.  The existing (1994) agreement 
does not provide for this right.  As a result, we have been pressing this 
counterparty to execute the Amended Physical Master.  However, the 
counterparty has delayed providing comments repeatedly.  Through Russell's 
diligence, the general counsel of Engage gave me another call on Tuesday and 
(finally) provided some comments on the agreement.  In addition to a few 
minor nits, the general counsel has informed me that he will not provide 
comments on the "credit related" provisions of the Amended Physical Master.  

He has told me that Engage requires that we put in place 
credit/collateral/netting agreements which contemplate:
a.  physical transactions (gas and power);
b.  financial transactions (gas and power);
c. all Enron entities which transact with Engage and Engage Energy America 
Corp. (i.e. ECC, ENA, EPMI and any other entity) (as a result, the agreements 
would have to contemplate US/Canada distinctions as well).

Such counsel refuses to proceed in any other manner at this time.  Further, 
he has expressly told me that he will not go to Westcoast Energy Inc. to 
provide a  guarantee which is specific to the Amended Physical Master.

In order to comply with Engage's demands (i.e. preparing a master netting 
agreement, a master credit/collateral agreement and a mechanism by which we 
would be able to monitor exposure across all parties and products) I believe 
will be a fairly large undertaking (considering the emerging nature of the 
physical power market, the complexities involved and the general lack of 
response we have experienced with Engage over the last 2.5 years).  However, 
I understand that we have undertaken such a task on occasion in the past 
(albeit, without additional concept of power trading) with respect to 
particularly important trading partners.

Frankly, I am concerned that Engage's position (although, theoretically a 
good concept) is just another stalling technique.  Nevertheless, I will leave 
the decision as to the manner to proceed with Engage to you.   

Please give me a call to discuss this matter when you get the chance ((403) 
974-6708).

Thanks,

Mark Powell.

Please execute final document for the limited agency agreement and I will 
walk it over to Bruce next week.

Also, I need a contract  for the following transaction:
 ECT selling to Entex Gas Marketing Company
 Nov 99 - March 00
 Katy tail gate  (both packages)
 10,000/d firm at HSC minus .1725 Nov 99 - March00 
 10,000/d firm at the greater of  HSC minus .02 or $2.00 with ECT's right but 
not the obligation to recall (not sell this package) if  the first of the 
month IF HSC is $3.00 or greater.


Call me with any questions.  5388

Oh yes, since we will not know what IF HSC is until after the beginning of 
the month, we have agreed to notify Entex of our intentions one day after 
NYMEX close by Noon.   

Thanks and may the force be with you

We had a brief meeting w/ Joe Dephner on this deal yesterday.  Apparently, 
Enron probably only company that could get bonds for this deal (5 years 
only).  Joe will be calling PEAK to discuss the lack of 10 year bonds and 
some of our proposals for alternatives.  based on their response we will 
decide to Go or NO GO.  I will keep you informed.

Hello Dan,

I'm going to be in Houston next week and I wonder if you might have a few 
minutes that I could stop by and speak with you about my Kaiser gas deal.  
Please let me know if there might be a good time on Tuesday or Wednesday.

Thanks,

Subject: Sample Enfolio Contract Form Attached



Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be
made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for
such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we
sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Okay..here we go again....hopefully for the last time.  

Dan - attached is GRE's comments to the August 7th Transaction Agreement.  
I've redlined the changes for your convenience.  They look okay to me.



There is, however, one additional change that is not included.  Essentially, 
GRE would like to be able to increase the DCQ and have such increase roll 
into the Inside FERC FOM pricing so long as proper notice to ENA is provided 
and the increase is consistent across the month.  GRE drafted some language 
which conceptually is okay; however, it is poorly worded.  GRE is also 
suggesting we place it in the section identified as OTHER:.  I really think 
it should be under Contract Price or Daily Contract Quantity. Could you 
please wordsmith this business point and place it where you deem 
appropriate.  I'll walk up GRE's fax'd language.

Thanks for all the help (and patience).

This is to confirm our conversation relating to the Option Agreement.  If EFI 
is to sign, I believe that the following changes need to be made.
 1.  The last sentence of paragraph No. 2 should be deleted.  The agreements 
provide that EFI has the right to assign to an affiliate without EI's 
consent.  EFI needs to maintain its right to so assign during the term of the 
agreements.
 2  Paragraph No. 3 needs to be modified by adding the words "as reasonably" 
before requested in the third line thereof; and deleting the word "not" in 
the fifth line thereof.  Additionally, the last sentence needs to be deleted, 
because the indemnity agreement needs to remain in effect for so long as EFI 
is requested to perform any services under those agreements.

Please call if these requested changes present any problems.

MSN DSL Service

The ClickAtHome program will be launching DSL service through MSN in mid 
February.  We are looking to identify a group of volunteers who are 
interested in helping us test the MSN installation processes prior to that 
launch.  

What's involved?
Participants will be asked to order MSN DSL service through the regular MSN 
retail  website or call center.  We will ask for your feedback on MSN's 
performance during and after the installation process.  As MSN requires a 
1-year contract (through both the standard retail process AND the ClickAtHome 
plan), participants will continue their service with retail MSN for the 
period of this contract.  Participants will receive their ClickAtHome program 
subsidy through a monthly reimbursemet process which will require the 
completion and submission of a reimbursement form.

Why do you want to participate?
You can order your DSL service now!
You will receive your ClickAtHome DSL subsidy
We will convert your account to the ClickAtHome plan after your 12 month 
period has expired
To Help out ClickAtHome Team 

What is the downside of participating?
Your order will not be placed through the ClickAtHome website, but rather 
through the standard MSN site
You will be required to pay the full monthly bill and apply for a 
reimbursement each month
You will be in a 12 month contract with MSN (the standard Enron plan will 
also require a 12 month contract)

Interested?
If you are interested in volunteering, please send your response to 
clickathomepilot1@enron.com for further information.  Thank you from the 
ClickAtHome team!

Debra,
 Please prepare another Master.  Deal should be identical to the one we did 
for your buddy.  That one was between ENA and ECT Merchant Investment Corp. 
This one should be with Brazos VPP Limited Partnership, a Texas limited 
partnership, and ENA. Check with Teresa regarding the ownership of Brazos.

Dan--

Quantum & Enernet have verbally agreed to the attached terms.  Per Shonnie's 
suggestion, I have forwarded the proposal to you in hopes that you could help 
to incoporate the terms into the definitive purchase and gathering 
documents.  I thought maybe we could use the latest Coleman documents as our 
"standard" to incorporate these terms...I think its the best one so far.

A couple notes: (1) Quantum and Enernet will both be signatory parties to the 
contract (if this is okay...however, who do we send the money to?...)
  (2)  Ignore the "Gathering System Financing" section for now

Please call me to discuss any/all aspects of this deal.

Thanks!

Dan

Brodgette.
 Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the 
confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by 
the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he 
would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed 
agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to 
Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?

******************************************************************************
**************************************************************
The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal 
express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am 
sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented 
by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.

Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Regards,
Bridgette Anderson

Dan,

Note blue mark-ups to your draft.  We only need one confirmation for one 
term.  Are you still working on the Exhibit A for Force Majeure??  We should 
go for the F.M. language as stated in the El Paso confirm that Les sent you.  
If not, we can later fall back to his more recent F.M. language that he is 
currently negotiating.

See you at 2 pm.  Thanks.

It's OK if you can up the ratings to BBB/Baa2 The new company could then be
downgraded one click and still remain investment grade.

Paul,
 Please check with your counterparty at Reliant for the full name of the 
Reliant Energy entity.  Is it Reliant Energy Gas Resources Corp. or some 
other name?  I am still confused about the fuel component of the volume.  We 
probably need to expand on the language in the prior draft to specify the 
fuel volume for the movement of the gas from the Delivery Point to 
___________________.   Have the attached documents been sent to Reliant 
Energy and if so have we received any comments from them?  I will draft a 
Transaction Agreement for the latest deal that will be similar to the prior 
deal.

Subject: Cage -Termination Amount

Debbie,
 Lisa Mellencamp has requested that we include our summary calculation for 
each Transaction being terminated separately, and specify the Deficiency 
Payment Amount for the period of non performance to the date of 
determination.  I believe that Russell previously stated that we terminated 
the Transactions effective as of 6/19/2000.  For that reason why are the 
amounts broken out for 6/20; 6/21-30; and 7/1-term?  She also wants to know 
what rate of interest are we demanding from the Termination Date.  Once I 
have the above information, I will send the attached letter as modified for 
the above.

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.

Dan,

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist 
PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally 
superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

Why is this necessary when we just executed a reduced price fuel supply 
contract with PQP LLC and we are in the process of trying to sell the asset 
and transfer the fuel contract to the new buyer and Glencore?

Subject: Amendment to Fuel Supply

Doug:

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

As you know I will be in London next week .  Could you work with Barry to get

document and put your initials on it.  There is also an index confirm to 
prepare.

Jeff, I understand that Stacey is on maternity leave.  This confirm is long 
over due. I have been working with Stacey to get it done. The attached 
document in it's finished state is what the customer and I have agreed to .  
Can you please have someone finalize the document and send back down to me 
for signatures.  

Barry 

PS. I also need the daily index confirm and we will clean it up also. BT

Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
finalize and re-submit to Crestar.

TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
than delete completely.


This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
and send back to me today. 

Thanks.

OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
and I will add changes that we went through. 

Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 

PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people.

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
 wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer; that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
 faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q:  Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A:  You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you find
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought to
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercise
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You should
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Christopher,

The environmental clearance referenced is actually a clearnace from the RUS 
to make sure that AEC has abided by the National Environmental Policy Act 
(NEPA).

The RUS enforces NEPA for Co-op's while FERC enforces NEPA for regulated 
utilities.  The NEPA clearance which is issued by the RUS is a standard 
procedure inherent in any development of this type.  AEC is constructing 
their new plant at an existing power plant site that is already permitted and 
been in operation for many years, thus this is a positive for the clearnace.  
I would expect the clearance to be granted by the RUS given AEC's past 
postive development work and relationship with the RUS as well as the fact 
that they are developing at an existing site.

It appears that I had a lot of time in the office.  Every day.  No vacation

Bruce/Dan , my only comment on th AOS contract is that Enron needs a ROFR
on any volumes post 9:00 AM.  If Enron does not want the gas then, Keyspan
/ BP has the right to market the gas to any other counter party.


Cheers,

Grant

Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

Kyle,
 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

79731.  The agreed to price is $45/acre at 640 acres, or $28,800.  I.C.

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the

no bill of sale is needed.

Yes that is correct.  When I spoke to the counterparty he mentioned wanting 
to be looked as their own Company.  Which is fine, since the entity is 
rated.  What these companies are doing is simply combining their 
petrochemical assests to become the largest company in that industry.  I 
tried telling Dan Hyvl that, but he didn't understand my viewpoint.  Yes 
their name is listed as an LP, but I really can't explain as to why it is.  I 
just told Dan to call them to get the entire Legal run-down from them.  We do 
need to execute a new Master though.

Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.

This is the list of ENA contracts to be assigned to HPL or LODISCO which 
George forwarded to me this afternoon. He intends that this is substantially 
all of such contracts but is continuing the review process and may have a few 
more to add. Please review this list and let me know if you see any problems 
with assigning these. As I mentioned previously, I will prepare the docs, 
just need to determine which contracts to schedule---Call me if you have any 
questions

Brent -

Attached are the spreadsheets proposed by HoustonStreet for the short 
descriptions.  The concept with the attached is that HoustonStreet will post 
the spreadsheets to the website and use them to ensure that customers can 
identify - by cross-checking the spreadsheet - the description applicable to 
the price/product.  In other words, this spreadsheet is intended to give the 
customer a cross-reference list between our description and the matching 
HoustonStreet description.

Please take a look at this at your convenience and let me know your 
thoughts.  I understand through Bob Shults that there is some urgency to this 
review.  Any assistance is appreciated.

Just to confirm what Dan Hyvl told me:

Use GTCs on both those deals until he can review the Single Transaction 
Purchase Firm contract (96005067).  Based on preliminary information, he 
feels that this contract was not set up to use as a master.  If Dan later 
determines that those transactions should indeed be under the contract, we 
can change the contract and inform the Confirms group (and Logistics if 
necessary) accordingly.  

Please keep Elizabeth informed of what's going on.

I'll keep you posted on what Dan wants us to do.

Thanks,

I'd rather be sure before we do anything else.  Since gas doesn't flow on

Sharon,

I'm not trying to make a big deal of it.  I also think that Elizabeth would 
let you know if there was an issue on a particular deal.  

This deal did NOT have a contract attached; I checked the audit tab to see 
when Elizabeth approved it (the comment will read "added user tag").  I just 
realized that the time was actually 5:30 when she approved it (gee, I can't 
subtract 12:00 from military time).  I apologize.

I'm still showing the deal without a contract attached.  Maybe we have a 
Sitara issue if you've already attached a deal.  I know we sometimes to have 
to open another version of deal manager to see a contract, but I've done that 
already and still don't see a contract.  Let me know if you see the same 
thing.

I'm sorry if I came across the wrong way - the trouble with email vs. 
face-to-face communication.  I just wanted to make sure you knew about our 
policy and was afraid someone had overlooked telling you during training.

FYI - once a telephonic deal has a contract attached, it will stay in your 
portfolio until the deal is VALIDATED.

Hope this clears everything up!

Thanks,
SBR

Hi Stacey,

I was not aware of that deal, and actually did not leave till about 5:15 on 
Friday. I have never left any outstanding deals out that I know of.  I have 
two scenarios, either it did not show up on my portfolio immediately after 
being released ( this has happened; where Liz has called and a particulary 
deal has not shown up yet. In that case, I closed and re-opened the 
portfolio) or either there were several fwd's still sitting out in that 
portfolio that had not been removed even though a contract was attached.

It has always been my practice to keep checking the telephonic and make sure 
they do have contracts attached since they sit out there so long.

Thanks,
Sharon

Hi Sharon,

I was checking the portfolios this morning and noticed a deal input on Friday 
around 4:30 that didn't have a contract attached.  We usually don't get too 
many deals coming in that late in the day, but please make sure to check your 
portfolios throughout the day and before you leave.  Even though this deal 
won't flow until 03/01/01, it is our policy to make sure that there are NO 
outstanding deals without contracts attached when we leave the office every 
day.  We will have exceptions, such as waiting on addition information or 
requesting clarification on something, that are OK to leave unattached.  I 
also know that Deal Capture does not always validate deals once we have 
attached contracts, but our group has committed to clear all unattached 
(non-problem) deals each day.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues with that particular 
deal.  I wasn't sure if you knew our group policy and I just wanted to make 
sure we don't get nailed on it some day.  I know you've been pretty busy 
handling other desks as well, and I appreciate that.

Thanks!
SBR

Wayne,
 I have modified the above contract as we discussed.  The "Customer's Agent" 
language is contained in Appendix "1".  Please have the contract signed by 
JER Partners, a J.E. Robert Company and fax it back to me.  I will then have 
it signed by Houston Pipe Line Company.  I have left the attachment at the 
end as originally drafted until I am able to talk to Gary Lamphier.  If it is 
truly correct that there are no minimum quantity obligations under the deal, 
then Gary may have to reprice the $0.09 discount for the 1000/d.  I will 
leave that up to Gary and you to resolve.

Christian,
 I received your email when I got back this morning.  Yes I had a great 
holiday.  Hopefully yours was the same.  Our Credit group has agreed to 
changing the collateral threshold from 10MM to 15MM for both parties.  Please 
make that change in the contract in section 4.5 in each of the places where 
10MM is located, print 2 originals of each, have them signed, and forward to 
me for further handling with Enron North America Corp.

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be
made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for
such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we
sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

I have again reviewed the master listing which Melissa prepared last Thursday 
and compared the names thereon to the RRC listing of Investor Owned Companies 
Filing Annual Reports for calendar year 1997.  Based thereon, the following 
companies should be excluded from the gas sales agreements being transferred 
to HPL:

City of Brazoria
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Empire Pipeline Corp.
Entex, a Division of NorAm Energy Corp.
Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Lone Star Gas Company
Markham Gas Corp.
Oasis Pipe Line Company
Petrofina Gas Pipeline Company
Reliant Energy - Entex
Southern Union Company  ---- This should be "Southern  Union Gas Company, a 
division of               Southern Union Company"
Southern Union Gas Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Additionally, we need to verify that Global Contract # 96003955 is not 
"Western Gas Resources-Texas, Inc."  If it is, it should also be excluded.

Also excluded is the Central Desk deal with "Central Illinois Light Company".

Have we determined if the agreements with "Entex Gas Marketing Company" and 
"Mercado Gas Services, Inc." are staying or going?

GSC manages the entire RFP process for its clients.  We maintain files for
each prospective/actual supplier, including many items that the clients
themselves do not have.  As we have the most comprehensive files relating to
each supplier in the RFP process, our clients have asked that we also have
an original executed contract and original executed guaranty to complete the
file.

Therefore, please route all three copies of the documents for review and
execution.

I will check with you on Tuesday on the status of Enron's review.

Have a nice weekend.
Kim

Kim,
     I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of
comparing the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.
Once I finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to
Enron Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will
let you know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the
deal contact for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know
when it has been signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be.
     If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart
execution which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by
WPSC.
     Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A
copy should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

Please confirm that you have received the executable copies of the
Wisconsin
Public Service contracts and Enron Corp guarantees.

Also, could you please give me an estimated date that Enron will mail the
partially executed contracts and executed guarantees to WPSC?  We would
appreciate them being sent by overnight mail.

Subject: Gas contracts for the listed meters

George,

The meters listed below flow into a section of line in East Texas that feeds 
a paper mill.  The gas currently being produced is rich, if we lose the 
market the gas production will have to be processed.  Processing will cost 
HPL a minimum of $250k.  Here's the kicker, need this ASAP becase the market 
wants to pull the trigger by Friday.

Here are the questions by meter, (this is important because processing 
options are different for every meter:

1. who are the supply contracts with
2. can HPL terminate the contract for gas quality or did we waive the quality 
requirements
3. what is the status of each contract, when does it terminate, is it in 
evergreen, what are the notification procedures
4. what is the price on each contract
5. what did the wells produce in the latest available month
6. last but not least, do the contracts let us charge the producer for costs 
incurred to bring the production up to pipeline quality

4112
9650
6027
5189
6411

Jim, are these meters correct?

Are there any questions I did not address?

Ami,

As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points 
appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the 
audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the 
focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions.  Stated 
differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General 
Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should 
be considered part of the Basket.

Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that 
the DCQ obligations apply  to "Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast 
Divisions."  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery 
Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was 
to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan 
Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this 
Transaction.

Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76 
Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the 
Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the 
applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.

Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to 
December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not 
seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered 
that the "Texas Coast Division" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is 
actually the "Gulf Coast Division."  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent 
for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future 
clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to 
discuss these issues with you further.

I hope you find this information useful.  If you have any questions or 
comments, please do not hesitate to call me or Aaron Roffwarg at (713) 
221-1117.

Dan,

The breakout of $0.20 for field gathering, $0.15 for compression plus actual 
fuel and shrink, and $0.15 for Ft. Union gathering works for me.

The last line of Section 2.1 is a problem. We cannnot guarantee a Feb 15. 
date. I would like to put that we will endeavor to install the facilities as 
quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron
. 
Section 4.2 - I don't agree with 90 days......I would settle on 45 days.

In the General Terms and Conditions definitions we need to leave dehydrator 
fuel and dehydrating terms in under Equivalent Quantities and Gathering.
Under Quality the 6% by volume of total inerts must stay.

Let me know what you have a problem with.

Thanks,
Mike

Dan,

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Houston Pipe Line Company deal.  If you have any questions please call me,

Is this a confirmation of a deal or just an offer ?
Have you got a deal number ? 
Our systems can not generate a confirmation without a deal number, so if this 
is just an offer, can we just send out Janet's attached document ?

 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse

this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is

Mr. Hyvl,

Happy New Year!  Hope you enjoyed the holidays.  Did you have a chance to
see if we could raise the threshold of $10 million for a Letter of Credit?
(see message below)

I agree.  The Accounting Dept. informed me that there are two days that
sometimes land on the 25th that CPS considers a holiday.  One is the day
after Thanksgiving and the other is during Fiesta for the Battle of Flowers
Parade.  I requested that they just pay a day early if the 25th lands on one
of these CPS holidays.

I have one more request, however.  In 4.5. Collateral
Requirement/Termination Payment Threshold, could you raise the threshold of
$10 million for a Letter of Credit to $15 or $20 million (whatever you feel
comforable with)?

Christian,
     I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th
is not a
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day
is a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are
open for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it
is not a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of
Business Day.  Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you
agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be
made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for
such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we
sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these

 Please let them know that they are using the wrong assignment list.  Remind 
them that the list was changing as late as noon Friday.  They need to check 
the final list.  They can get that from George Weismann.

Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!
Cyndie

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).

Subject: Guadalupe Power Partners LP

Tom, it appears that the ENA - IM Texas Desk is currently booking the 
Guadalupe Power Partners LP deal on a month to month basis only.  As such, it 
doesn't strictly meet the Material Contracts definition requiring that the 
deal be booked to flow more than 2,500 Mmbtu/d after 5/1/2001 or booked to 
flow more than 1,000 Mmbtu/d after 5/1/2002.  Is it still Enron's intent to 
deliver the Guadalupe Power Partners LP deal to AEP?  If so, I believe the 
contract pursuant to which the deal is done should continue to be included on 
the Mateiral Contracts list.

Patrick, I will assemble a list of ENA contracts that contributed to the 
financials that were presented in the data room.   This list will include any 
ENA contract that flowed between 5/1999 and 4/2000 and contributed to the 
HPLC financials.  If there are any ENA contracts that did not flow during 
that period, such as the Guadalupe Power Partners LP contract, it will be 
necessary to add them to the list of contracts to be moved from ENA to NEWCO 
if our intent is to include those contracts in Triple Lutz.

Jim, the Guadalupe Power Partners LP contract (96029942) was not included in 
the data room since, having no flow, it did not meet the minimum 3,000/d flow 
requirement to be included among contracts comprising the top 80% of the flow 
on HPLC.  Global Contracts indicates that the contract is dated 8/23/99, but 
has an operational effective date of 3/1/2001 with a primary term ending on 
3/31/2003.  Notes indicate that a daily flow of 80,000 Mmbtu is expected.  
The contract has not been scanned into the Global Contracts System.

Was there a deal with Guadalupe Power in the data room?  I have recently 
heard about the deal and Tom is concerned about it.  From what I can gather 
it is a Gas Daily priced deal (so I haven't marked it) so it hasn't shown up 
in my calculations.  I guess we just want to know that Duke/AEP where made 
aware of this contract.  Please let me know.

THE GIFT OF LIFE
 submitted by Amber Tozer
 
On the very first day, God created the cow.  He said to the cow, "Today I 
have created you!  As a cow, you must go to the field with the farmer all day 
long.  You will work all day under the sun!  I will give you a life span of 
50 years."

The cow objected, "What? This kind of tough life you want me to live for 50 
years? Let me have 20 years, and the 30 years I'll give back to you."  So God 
agreed.

On the second day, God created the dog.  God said to the dog, "What you are 
supposed to do is to sit all day by the door of your house.  Any people that 
come in, you will have to bark at them!  I'll give a life span of 20 years."

The dog objected, "What?  All day long to sit by the door? No way!  I give 
you back my other 10 years of life!"  So God agreed.

On the third day, God created the monkey.  He said to the monkey, "Monkeys 
have to entertain people.  You've got to make them laugh and do monkey 
tricks.  I'll give you 20 years life span."

The monkey objected. "What?  Make them laugh?  Do monkey faces and tricks?  
Ten years will do, and the other 10 years I'll give you back."  So God agreed.

On the fourth day, God created man and said to him, "Your job is to sleep, 
eat, and play.  You will enjoy very much in your life.  All you need to do is 
to enjoy and do nothing.  This kind of life, I'll give you a 20 year life 
span."

The man objected.  "What?  Such a good life!  Eat, play, sleep, do nothing?  
Enjoy the best and you expect me to live only for 20 years?  No way, 
man!....Why don't we make a deal?  Since the cow gave you back 30 years, and 
the dog gave you back 10 years and the monkey gave you back 10 years, I will 
take them from you!  That makes my life span 70 years, right?"  So God agreed.

AND THAT'S WHY....
In our first 20 years, we eat, sleep, play, enjoy the best and do nothing 
much.  For the next 30 years, we work all day long, suffer and get to support 
the family.  For the next 10 years, we entertain our grandchildren by making 
monkey faces and monkey tricks.  And for the last 10 years, we stay at home, 
sit by the front door and bark at people!

FYI----Don't know what happened to my recommendation that they use either an 
unexecuted agreement notation or call the counterparty from the trading floor 
on a recorded line.

Subject: Re: GTC'S AND CONFIRMS  


Re 1. I don't believe that the traders on 35 are appropriately covered based 
on what Dan has told me.  Is that a concern?  If so, it is possible to 
manually change the confirm to fit the situation for the mean time.

Re 3.  I understand what Mary is saying, but in these cases that I'm 
referring to (which I believe are rare), I believe the gas is flowing.  The 
meter has been turned on and isn't the pipeline accepting the gas?  We are 
still not nominating the gas, and because we have not put the ticket into the 
system, we are withholding payment.  Now, from what I understand, client 
services will make a manual payment, if they are called by the producer.  
But, for 1 month or even 2 months, we have not made a payment, because client 
services would not have known to make a payment, therefore, we are still in 
violation.  It appears the best solution legally, would be not to turn on the 
meter until the contract is signed.  I'm not sure that is a good business 
decission though.

I know that there are cases where we don't know that the meter is still 
flowing, or that it has been turned on.  I think the easiest thing would be 
to make sure that we are covered with a GTC spot, taking out the language of 
the recorded line.

Julie, 

In response to your concerns below:

1.  The traders on 35 are currently attempting to install a recorded line to 
be used when negotiating.

2.  The difficulty with putting in a contract as unexecuted is that Unify 
will not prevent the payment from going out the door.  I do not believe Unify 
Settlements drafts based on contract status, it drafts on any Sitara deal 
that replicated down, and Sitara reads unexecuted as a valid contract.  

3.  We have posed the possibility of entering the contract as unexecuted and 
enhancing Unify to hold payment as long as there was VP approval to hold 
payment, but Mary Cook said that this process would be in violation of the 
UCC based on the fact that we would partially perform (by accepting the gas 
via the nom/scheduling process).  With this partial performance, withholding 
the payment would not be appropriate under the law.  

Please let me know your thoughts after reviewing my comments.

Thank you, 
Melissa

Subject: GTC'S AND CONFIRMS


While going through our confirmation process, there was some concern raised 
on deals that we are not confirming.  I'm sure you are aware of the concern 
that George W. had with not wanting a confirmation to go out to the producers 
when they were trying to get a firm contract signed.  I spoke with Dan Hyvl 
today and I wanted to relay to you his thoughts.

His first concern was if the Asset Traders were trading on a recorded phone 
lines.  Apparently the GTC's specify that if there is a dispute with what is 
on the confirmation, the recorded phone call would be the back up.  He said 
that if these calls are not recorded, then we should not be using the GTC's.  
In the case where the tickets are being held back until the contract is 
signed (example: a ticket was submitted today to start back in June), then we 
should be putting the contract in as unexecuted so the deal can be valued and 
tracked.  His decision on that issue was based on my memory that if a 
contract is marked unexecuted, Unify would not make payment.  If that is not 
the case, we could still put the contract and deal in the systems, and have a 
VP signed off that payment would not go out the door.

If deals are being done on an unrecorded phone line, Dan said that we would 
need to do something different if the payment is to go out the door.  Like 
for example, have the producer sign a one month contract.  Which I'm not sure 
you would want to do that.  Otherwise, he said that the trades should be sent 
down to 31 so they will be recorded.

I hope this makes sense.  Please call me, and let me know your thoughts.

Julie

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Read the text before looking at the picture.

A class of elementary students started a class project to
make a planter to take home and wanted to have a plant in
it that was easy to take care of, so it was decided to use
cactus plants. The students were given greenware pottery
of a clown planter, and they painted them with glaze and
had them professionally fired at a class outing so they
could see the process. It was  great fun.

They planted the cactus seeds in the finished planters, and
they grew nicely but unfortunately the children were not
allowed to take them home.

The cactus plants were removed and a small ivy replaced
them, and the children were then allowed to take the
planters home.

The teacher said cactus seemed like a good idea at the time....

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Dan,

I have closed a transaction with Shell Oil with an end date of June 30, 2001.
Please reference O:/COMMON/LEGAL/DHYVL/DJH/CONTRACT/98003DCTR.DOC  and 
O:/COMMON/LEGAL/DHYVL/DJH/CONTRACT/98003ACTR.DOC

I have extended both agreements but the start dates are one month apart.

Changes to Contract Price:

1) Gas price is IF - HSC less (.01) 
2) same (excess priced at GD HSC Mid plus .04 two days after) Daily not 
monthly
3) Spot (buyback) Price is Gas Daily Katy Midpoint 2 days after  Daily not 
monthly

Volume 90,000 mmbtu/d for a year:
If volume is less than 32,850,000 mmbtu at year end, Shell will be billed .10 
per mmbtu less than 32,850,000

The first of the month  nominated volumes must range between 40,000 - 130,000 
per day and be nominated prior to bid week

You are not going to believe this.  I have yet another change!  Pursuant to
recent changes by the United States General Services Administration, the
standard language we currently use in the Utilization of Business Concerns
requires updating.  The new language is provided in red in the attached file
below.  Could you please update the provision in our contract to reflect the
new language?  I guess it's good that it happened at this time.  Otherwise,
I would have had to issue an amendment.  Thanks ...

Christian,
     I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached
contract document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended
that the Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on
any invoice that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way
that we have to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.
Therefore, i have not removed that line from the address,  At such time as
the Purchase Order Number is available, please send a revised address
notice to the company containing such number.  Until that happens, it will
be understood that no number has been provided.  Please call if you have
any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed
a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Enjoyed having lunch.  I got back and Time Warner was available for my zip

is $15.00 per month plus installation.  I will let you know when it is hooked

Dan,

Per the request of Jay Williams, attached please find a credit worksheet for 
a draft Enfolio Master Firm Purchase and Sale Agreement between ENA and 
Sacramento Municipal Utility District.  Please note that there are tiered 
collateral threshold and third-party cross default matrices.  Additionally, 
the attachment contains a second sheet elaborating on the Enron Corp. 
guaranty amount as well as a Compliance Letter as an additional CP Event of 
Default.

Shari Stack is working on the draft EEI Master Power agreement as well as the 
ISDA Master Swap agreement.  Please contact Shari Stack should you need 
clarification to the legal terms in the contract in order to ensure 
consistency across all three trading agreements.

I am also available should you have any questions pertaining to credit.

Kim,
 I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of 
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If we 
need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the version 
that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for this years 
volume and price.  What is your preference?

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

Dan,

Attached is a redlined version of a purchase agreement for True Oil Company. 
Please review and let me know what's good and what's not.

NOTES:

True Oil will probably become an LLC sometime this year.  Does that change 
anything?

In Article 3.2 - True would like to know why that should be in there if we 
are not lending money to them and they do not owe us money.

Article 3.4 - I added this. They would like some language added that gives 
them the right to put compression in at their expense and the purchase price 
re-negotiated should this article come into play.

Article 5 Force Majeure - Why is force majeure here and in the definitions? 
Can one or the other be deleted??

Article 7.3 - True would like to know why there are set-offs here if we owe 
them.

Article 7.4 - Is this paragraph necessary? Supposedly, True has not seen this 
paragraph in any other contract.

Article 7.5 - filing of the Notice of Gas Contract - Where would this be 
filed and why?

General Provisions - Seller's Representative Matters - I assume that the 
first sentence, "authorized agent.....", takes care of the Committed Reserses 
that True does not have 100% ownership to. In other words, they cannot commit 
ownership that they do not have.

Exhibit F - I added this Exhibit. The very last sentence about pulsation. If 
ENA is purchasing the gas at the inlet of the screw compressor....we are 
supplying the compression, should this be deleted.


Call with any questions, comments, concerns or if you just want to say HI !!!


Take care,
Mike

Dan --

Your amendment is fine.  I did want to have an EnronOnline confirmation as
"exh B," however, and attach an exh B to this amendment.

Is it possible for you to fax a confirm showing a deal will be subject to
this "master gas purchase and sale agreement."  I would like to assure
myself of what it looks like and what language it contains.

Thank you so much.  (Fax: 415-973-5520)

Dave,
     I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough
and merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only
item that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The
signed version of the contract that was provided after signature by
Charlotte goes directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I
would like the language inserted that you indicate is already in the
contract.  I agree that the language was in the versions prior to the final
version.  Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If
not, please have PG&E sign two copies and forward to me.  I will have them
signed by ENA and will return a fully executed original for your files.

Dave,
 I have attached the above sample form for your review.  I have been unable 
to find any documentation where we act as an agent for the shipper and 
contractually agree to remarket their unused capacity.  As soon as I find 
some language, I will forward same to you.  As we discussed, the major 
concerns that I have concerning the Energy Marketing Services Agreement form 
that Kaiser provided relates to the duties of the Marketer thereunder.  ENA 
is in the business of buying and selling natural gas for its own account and 
as such any services it agreed to provide relating to most of the items under 
Articles III and IV would be subject to claims of abuse or violation of 
fiduciary duties.  Specifically, ENA should not agree to perform the items 
under  Article IV, Section A. Parts 1-8, 11; Article IV, Section B.  
Parts1-2, 4, 6; Article IV, Sections C, E, and F.  Otherwise, ENA sales 
obligations should be patterned in the manner set forth in the Enfolio 
Contract which provides safeguards for both parties in the event of a default 
by either.  
 Therefore, we need to work from our Enfolio contract and I will get you some 
agency language for the confirm to address how we would share any 
transportation savings that we were able to obtain for them during the term 
of our sales transaction with them.  
 Please call me after you have had a chance to review the contract.

Mark,

I had remembered our previous conversation regarding having ENA and ECC on 
the seperate guaranty's.  If we need to have two seperate guaranty's please 
coordinate with Dan Hyvl to have separate guaranty's issued.  I have attached 
another amended credit worksheet which detail the guaranty amounts required.  
Please note that as a result of current market conditions, we need to have 
the draft contract and guaranty's sent to the counterparty as soon as 
possible.  Also my credit contact at Engage is a lady named Sandra 
(403-297-1476) and I have reviewed with her our needs, if Suzzi Sethi does 
not understand our urgency on this, please communicate this to Sandra.  I 
will be out the rest of the week and will not be able to be contacted.

Thanks
Russell.

Hey Russell,

We talked about this point earlier (see an e-mail to you dated September 22, 
2000) and we agreed that the guarantees would not reference both Enron North 
America and Enron Canada Corp.  There were a number of reasons for this (ie. 
complexity regarding future amendments, the differences/peculiarities between 
Canadian and American law, possible "permanent establishment" issues we had 
discussed, etc.).  You may also want to look at the e-mail I sent to you on 
September 26, 2000 (re: the East desk deals with ENA).

Is this not the case anymore?  I think it is better to have separate 
guarantees for all of the reasons mentioned in the September 22, 2000 e-mail, 
the September 26, 2000 e-mail and this e-mail.

Please let me know.

Mark Powell

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Phil DeMoes asked if we could put together a contract with these folks.  I 
was going done the route of the master because he thought that they would 
want to buy from us and sell to their commercial customers.  In reviewing the 
attached information, they appear to be doing something more intuned to 
putting the parties together.  Is this similar to the deals that Travis and 
Mark Greenberg are working on and if so, should I forward to them?

Please review the language under B of Contract Price of the Transaction

Pasadena Usage under your term sheet.  Likewise, I have added item C under El

I have received the list of CES agreements which George put together as 
having Texas delivery points and have been attempting to put together a back 
to back agreement similar to the back to back agreement which ENA has with 
CES; however, I keep running into confidentially agreement problems.  I 
understand that these CES agreements relate to June business and have no 
deals and/or term beyond that point.  I suggest that the deliveries under 
these agreements be documented as a GTC Confirmation between ENA and HPL and 
thus avoid the confidentiality agreement problems.  George Weissman and Bob 
Hall feel that this is a workable solution.  We will proceed with the 
preparation of GTC's for each deal unless I hear otherwise.

Cheryl,
 I am the person who asked Debra if she could find the confirms for the 
deal.  The system indicated that the deals were confirmed in legal and I knew 
that I had not received a request for any deals covering the time period post 
of 3/31/99 under that GISB.  If done in legal it should have been by me or 
Debra.  In any case if a confirm was done, it should have been filed with the 
confirm desk, and not with the HPL contract.  I apologize for not contacting 
you directly.  We needed the document immediately and the HPL contract group 
has already indicated that they did not have it.

Subject: Re: Exxon/HPL GISB  

Debra,

The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
(cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
confirm out of Tagg. 

I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
been attached to the GISB.

Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.

I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
since it's the only record I could pull up.

Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
SBR

Mr. Hyvl,

How the heck are you ???
Thanks for the quick turnaround on the Westport contracts.
I am hoping Bierbach will sign them this week and I will get one of the 
originals back to you ASAP and get the other original to Westport.


I need a draft copy of the latest gathering agreement and purchase agreement 
so that True Oil Company can start to review them.
We do not have a deal done with them YET but they would like to start 
reviewing the contracts.

Let me know if this is a problem!

Mike

Dan -- It sounds okay, but I would expect them to question the need for this 
provision.  Of course, the first reason is that the deal needs to get done.  
The second is the reg-out that FP&L wants.  Is it a fair representation that 
our language is the same as FP&L's?  I know the language is not identical, 
but I want to say our language is a very short version of what FP&L has 
drafted.  Is this okay?

Also, the traders want to be sure that the $0.50/MMBtu LD's are also 
incorporated.  You may have heard this request already, so disregard mine if 
duplicate?

Thanks -- David

This is in follow-up to the deal transfer matter we discussed this morning.

Julie Meyers called me and stated that Tom Martin had called her to put the 
deal transfer from HPL to ENA on hold till Monday; however, she had already 
moved them in the system.  I asked her to find out if the deals had been 
confirmed under HPL and if so, I would need to prepare a document to transfer 
them from HPL to ENA.  She agreed to send me a list of the deals that had 
been moved and whether or not they had been documented with the 
counterparty.  Apparently, they had been and Jennifer Blay has now 
redocumented two of the deals as ENA deals.

went into effect 12/21 of last year.  They will meet on March 5th from 1 to 3 
p.m. at the Hyatt Regency - Sandelwood Room A.  He says that eventhough they 
are trying to keep the group small it makes sense that you and I attend.  He 
did say that space was not a problem.  I told him that you and I did want to 
attend if for no other reason than to find out about the gray areas that we 
still need to be watchful of.  i.e. who is an "eligible contract participant" 
under the revised law.  What representations need ot be made, if any, by the 
customer?

Walter,
 The document is okay if you put it on ENA letterhead, and add the 
counterparty's name in the blank in the signature area.  Please call if you 
need anything futher.

Dan, could you please take a look at this confidentiality agreement that I 
received back from GWF?  The attached version below was changed only to add 
their name and commodity; otherwise it's identical to the version I sent them 
(and that I had gotten from you).  Please let me know if it's acceptable and 
I'll get it signed.  Thanks!

the only update to the attached is at the bottom where:



the scheduled vols are at the Index price, and anything greater than the 
scheduled vols are at GDA.   Thus, any vols more than expected are @ GDA.

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

Darren,
 If you can get me a copy of the contractual documents that govern the 
physical deals that we are doing with the counterparty, I will modify the 
language to reflect the contractual arrangement that we are relying upon.

Thank you for the quick reply, but I am not sure if this form is applicable. 
The counterparty PSNC Production Corp. is not governed by a Master Physical, 
which this current form references. Is there an open grty. format that can be 
used to cover PSNC's physical business with ENA?

Ellen,
 As we discussed, please change the Special Conditions: to read:  
 
 In consideration of the delivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas by Customer to 
Company pursuant to Part A above and the redelivery of 310,000 MMBtu of gas 
by Company to Customer pursuant to Part B above, Company will pay Customer 
the sum of US Dollars $123,070.00 on April 25, 2001.  Notwithstanding 
anything to the contrary contained in Section 3.2 of the Base Contract, a 
party's delivery obligation pursuant to Part A and Part B above shall 
continue until such party has delivered an aggregate of 310,000 MMBtu of gas 
to the other party.

 I have discussed the above with Deirdre and she is okay with the language.  
Remember to  add signature lines for each party and provide Deirdre with a 
copy for her records.

Darren,
 There are no previous confirmations.  You have one single purpose contract 
that was done in 1994 that has a primary term through 8/31/02.  What do you 
mean "preceding confirmations".  Confirmations are only done under trading 
type master contracts.  That does not apply to the current contract with 
Haldor.  You should become familar with the current contract before you 
request changes to that deal.

I am under the impression that this Master Physical Contract will supercede 
any preceding confirmations.Please correct me if I am wrong.

Darren,
 Please reread.  This confirm covers the period 9/1/02 - 8/31/04.  The 
current deal stays in effect until 8/31/02.  Let me know about the hyphen.  
That is the way they signed the last contract.  You have their published 
financials,  How is it in the signature portion of those.

Dan,
Everything looks good. In the openning paragraph, I think that 
"Haldor-Topsoe" should not have the hyphen. Am I correct in assuming that 
this master supercedes all existing confirms?

Haldor Topsoe has agreed to terms of 110% of IF-HSC through August 31, 2004.  
I will have legal prepare the Master physical and the confirmation.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.


-Darren

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.

Lee,

I think that neither entity (Chevron or Phillips Corp) is considered a
general partner.  Our company, Chevron Phillips Chemical Co. is directly and
solely responsible for payment of all debt.

While I was out, did Ron Corn get you set up to speak with someone in our
Treasury Dept?  I forwarded your inquiry to Ron, so hopefully he handled
what you needed a couple of weeks ago.

Art, 

Attached is the contract that would govern this transaction.  Barry and I 
have discussed San Juan risks but we are willing to take it - however, the 
actual offer at this time is $4.65 for 15,000 to 20,000 delivered at the 
Blanco Pool.  When you are ready to transact, I will update the exact price 
at that time.  Let me know what you want to do.

Thanks,

Kim

Dan,

Here is the scope of the deal with Citizens Utilities, there are a couple of 
things we will have to mention in the contract that are not addressed in this 
letter:
1)  That all load balancing will be handled by injection and withdrawal from 
storage, and that these incremental costs (i.e. variable charges) will be 
paid 
      by Citizens.
2.)  I need to work out a predetermined load profile with Citizens, and that 
profile will need to be in the contract.  This load profile will be used as a 
guide
       and the contract language will need to be able to accommodate 
nomination changes on a daily basis, at our discretion.

I'm sure you will need further explanation, so feel to call me.  Thanks again 
for all you help.

Here are my comments on the drafts which you sent over this morning (subject 
to further review): 

(1) In "OTHER", the definition of weekday/weekend day/holiday need to be 
consistent with the NYISO definition.? I suggest that "Weekday" means Monday 
through Friday except for "Holidays".? "Holidays" means "NERC-defined 
holidays" (this is consistent with what NYISO uses in its services tariff).? 
"Weekend day" means Saturday and Sunday.

(2) In Part II, "OTHER" part 2., 8th line, the period after "November 30, 
2000" and before "Customer" needs to be changed to a comma.? You already made 
this correction in the December transaction document.

(3) In BDKW12off-peak, "CONTRACT PRICE (PER MMBTU)", the true-up still 
doesn't work.? The reason that we suggested it be moved to a side letter is 
that, when we sign a November deal, we may or may not also sign a December 
deal.? If the December deal is not signed, there is no carryforward of 
Enron's possible loss from the November deal.? If you change "CONTRACT PRICE 
(PER MMBTU)" in BDKW12off-peak to get rid of the true-up language, the side 
letter would basically say that Sithe will pay to Enron the "lesser of (x) 
the negative of the sum of the negative values, if any, determined under Part 
(b) of Transaction Nos. BD...,etc. and (y) the sum of the positive values, if 
any, determined under Part (b) of Transaction Nos. BD...,etc."

(4) In BDKW12on-peak, we can just use "weekday" instead of "weekday day", to 
be consistent with the other monthly transactions.? Also, in "CONTRACT PRICE 
(PER MMBTU)", part A, "24 hrs/day" should be replaced with "16 hrs/day".? In 
Part II, "OTHER" parts 1. and 2., change "570 MW" to "____ MW".

I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified, 
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to 
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next 
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so long

So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I just 
bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that and 
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probably 
sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the 
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the 
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Subject: Re: Heartland Invoice for March  

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

invoice.  Thanks.

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

Sorry, Dan.  I have no earnest money contract.  I'm taking this on cold
turkey as no one else has worked on this sale with Earp.  I need everything
from the get go.

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.

     I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement
and have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best
efforts" which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read
"commercially reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the
same throughout the document where we use the term "commercially reasonable
best efforts".  With this change, please print out two copies of the
contract and two copies of the transaction agreement and proceed with
execution of each.  Please call if you have any questions.

Subject: Alabama Gas Corporation

Per my rambling voicemail: Alagaso (Alabama Gas Corporation) has sent two 
termination letters requesting termination of two of the 3 CES contracts 
(sorry for the confusion on the voicemail - - -- brain starts to slip after 
lunch). All three of the contracts aren't our favorites per our earlier 
conversations/e-mails dating back to the beginning of round 2, duplication 
clean-up. The largest problem; the 1991 contract that they are terminating 
has the greatest Max. Daily Quantity (20,000/day) (this was the one we were 
favoring out of the three). However, the combined daily quantity on all the 
outstanding deals by far exceeds the MDQ. A schedule of the outstanding deals 
on the 9/1/91 (96029223) is attached. If we have the new contract in hand, I 
can enter the new contract & hopefully move these deals over (the ones for 
which gas has not yet flowed) - - - - - - we can split & move any deals for 
which gas is currently flowing - - - - - - - we will need the Confirm group 
to reconfirm. This is assuming that we do indeed have the new agreement 
executed by both parties.

Back to the letters, they want our signature to waive the 90 day notice. The 
1990 contract have been on trading suspended status since 7/18/00 & has no 
outstanding deals. So, if we are 'okay' with that - - - - - there are no 
loose strings (if okay, do you want to sign?). However, on the 1991 contract 
there are LOTS of loose ends - - - - - -- what is your recommendation? 

Fun stuff eh? I've left messages with Tammi DePaolis, the trader working with 
Alagaso, about the above referenced scenarios. Apparently Alagasco was wanted 
these letters back tomorrow (9/26/00).

I've attached copies of all of the contracts in question for your review. I 
have the letters in hand.



Thanks!!
Cyndie

Barbara,

Its pretty clear from Brian's message to Brenda Herod of 9/26 that he has had 
meetings with Entex's Bruce Coogler (or at least "discussions") and that he 
intends to have more meetings (perhaps this week). 

I would like to know if there is anything you want me to do about this matter 
or if I should pass your advice on to Dan Hyvl.  I haven't been involved in 
any Entex or regulatory advisory matters with Brian to this point, I simply 
received an e:mail from Dan asking for a second opinion.

Please let me know.

I don't think Brian, the President of HPL should be having any meetings with 
Entex................if someone is to meet with Entex, it needs to be an ENA 
person; similarly, we should not be asking for a meeting with Entex.  If 
ENTEX wants to schedule a joint meeting,it might be okay to 
attend............depending on the subject matter...........ANYTHING HAVING 
TO DO WITH PRICING SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED...........i BELIEVE MORE FACTS 
NEED TO BE MARSHALLED.

Barbara,
I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Dave,
 Volume, term and price are necessary components of the confirm.  Do not send 
out without these components being in place.  Also, changing from the January 
dates will require additional language changes.  I will make those changes 
when we fill in the rest of the information.  How do we stand on getting the 
final version of the Master Contract drafted and submitted to them for 
signature.  Remember, we need that in place before we do the confirm.,

Mr. Hyvl,

Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until
we have a fully executed contract, so it looks like I will have to take that

the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.

I just confirmed with Dan at Enron that clause #5 can stay as is. I
verified that Crestar will notify Enron by 9:00am of the volume to be
supplied by both Crestar and Enron and Enron will notify both BP and
Crestar by 9:45am in a single e-mail of the contracts to nominate to with
the applicable volumes.

So the assignment can be sent out with Dan's other changes incorporated.

Thanks everyone,

Michael,

     I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following
comments.

1.   Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:

Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office
located at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as
"Consenting Party")

2.   Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some
applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment,
however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for
making its own nominations each day.

3.   Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and
Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.

     Please call if you have any questions.

                                   Dan Hyvl

Cathy,
 The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard 
interruptible 311 contract.  t is a month to month interruptible contract.  I 
see no reason why it should not be signed.   Please call me if you need 
anything further.  I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office 
starting on Monday.

Subject: Survivor

CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning
"Survivor, Texas Style."

The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San
Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio,
on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From
there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm
gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."

The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

Steve,  
 Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of 
the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work.  
The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the 
measured mcfs including both purchase and transport?

Regarding the January 1, 1998 GISB and the April 1, 1998 GISB, the January 1,

extend beyond one month.  I assume that this was assigned to ENA.

 2.4.      Begin the first sentence with "Except for the express duty

Dan,  Attached is the form.  It references the agreement we are lending the 
money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have 
exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any 
existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are 
subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in 
Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing 
security interest.

Dynergy have accepted that the contract that they have prepared for Natural 
Gas Liquids is in effect an interruptible contract although it is not 
described as such and that this needs to be re-visited.
 
I will be sending further comments today which will attempt to move the 
contract closer towards what we would like to see in our contracts.
 
Kind regards
 
Marcus

Lee,
 I have removed the collateral requirements from this document because we 
have blanket security request rights in the base contract.  Don't you agree?

 The final version is attached for you to send to the customer and have them

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?

Dan,
Lisa,

I am assuming we have not heard anything from Cage, and it has been 12 days 
since we sent them the letter notifying of the amounts they owe us.

I guess we can move on to the next step.

Please advise,

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several 
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since 
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Hi folks,

I have been getting calls from both Engage US credit and Engage Canada credit 
regarding the guaranty's we have in place and what they want in place.  I 
have also been working on getting the ISDA's and Master Physicals in place.  
I want to see if we can get some resolution on these issues.  Below is a list 
of the entities Enron is trading out of and with which Engage entity.  Can we 
please work to get the contracts and guaranty's in place.  Let me know how I 
can move forward with my Engage contacts.

Enron Entity                Engage Entity                   Contract 
Type/Collateral Amnt.                Engage Guarantor/Amnt
ENA   Engage US   ISDA   $20MM      Coastal $20MM
ENA   Engage US   Master Firm Purchase Sale $10MM  Coastal $10MM
ECC   Engage Canada  ISDA   $10MM     Westcoast Gas $10MM**
ECC   Engage Canada  Master Firm Purchase Sale $15MM  Westcoast Gas $15MM**

**With respect to the Westcoast Gas Guaranty, I am prepared to accept a total 
amount of $25MM covering both guaranty's and both products.  I know a 
guaranty from Westcoast has been received for review by Mary Cook covering 
financial transactions, although now this guaranty or a separate guaranty 
should be received tied to the Master Physical between ECC/Engage Canada for 
an additional $15MM.

Also, with respect to the Coastal guaranty between ENA and Engage US, I feel 
we should get and give two separate guaranty's for financial and physical.  I 
have discussed this with Debra Perlingiere as it relates to the Master 
Physical.

The guaranty issues seem to be the largest issues.  Can I get an update from 
each person involved with one of the above contracts to let me know where we 
stand on these issues.  

Regards,
Russell

Gary,
 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.

Janet, Gil and Ed,

Please note Les' latest summary of Elba.  Things seem to be coming to a head 
there.  Southern Co. was in town last Thursday to visit us and Les agreed to 
start working on a letter of intent with Southern Co for the sale of gas from 
the terminal.   We have been asked to work up a good price for gas at Elba by 
Les.  I have started working with John Hodge and John Griffith on this.

So. Co.'s latest offer was Hub + $.12 for all 160,000 dt/d.  So. Co. wants 
100,000 dt/d at Elba and will give us the option of selling to them the 
remaining 60,000 dt/d at Elba or Destin at our option.  We have not discussed 
what a price at Destin should be.  So. Co. has some leverage with El Paso 
that can be instrumental in helping Les with his negotiations below.  
Additionally, they may be the only party that can burn the high btu gas and 
significantly improve the btu issue at Elba.

We should be better prepared to talk about this by Wednesday.  Let me know if 
you have any questions.

Subject: SOUTHERN LNG re ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL

GREETINGS:

On November 17, 2000 Southern LNG advised the FERC that it "has determined to 
withdraw the Btu stabilization options from the instant certificate 
application", such application being the one seeking to amend the certificate 
issued by the FERC in March, 2000 authorizing Southern LNG to reactivate the 
LNG terminal at Elba Island.

With this withdrawal, the El Paso organization has drawn its line in the 
sand.  We plan to vigorously protest this withdrawal at the FERC within the 
15 day period allowed by FERC procedures.  This gives us until December 2, 
2000 to file which, presumably, would be extended until Monday, December 4, 
2000.

Our filing will be of an adversarial nature, so the Enron organization needs 
to be on board with our intended filing, which we will commence drafting on 
November 20, 2000.  Drafts will be circulated to the appropriate personnel, 
so please advise us re any additions in that regard.

At the same time, this decision by Southern LNG will focus our resolve to 
complete the commercial transaction with El Paso Merchant Energy.  We have 
come to accept some of the less desirable features of the Letter 
Agreement/Term Sheet signed with El Paso Merchant Energy on October 13, 1999, 
inasmuch as the more important aspects are very much in our favor, including 
several that Southern LNG found rather unsettling.  We will discuss the path 
forward with El Paso Merchant Energy on November 21-22, 2000.

While we remain open to a solution to the quality issue that leaves our 
commercial flexibility and optionality intact, we must be positioned to move 
forward resolutely and in a timely manner with both El Paso Merchant Energy 
and Southern LNG.  We cannot afford to stop these processes while we discuss 
alternative solutions.


On Wednesday, November 15, 2000, we gave both Mike Varagona and David Jenkins 
of El Paso Merchant Energy a "heads-up" regarding our likely response to 
Southern LNG's proposed letter agreement dated November 1, 2000.  We 
indicated we would be asking Southern LNG to bifurcate the FERC proceeding 
into the Vaporizer Project, that could proceed quickly and on an independent 
path to certification, and the Stabilization Project, that required 
considerably more technical analyses before it could proceed.  When I 
contacted Mike Varagona on Friday, November 17, 2000, after we received a 
copy of Southern LNG's letter to the FERC, he stated that he had not been 
advised by Southern LNG regarding its decision, hence, had not been 
positioned to return the favor.

Mr. Varagona will be in Houston on November 21 and 22, and he wants to meet 
with us.  He is still pushing for a commercial solution that sees El Paso 
"take on the quality risk" in return for our firming up our volumes to El 
Paso Merchant Energy at an improved price of Henry Hub plus approx. $0.08 per 
MMBtu.  Let there be no doubt that El Paso and Southern LNG will find a 
solution to the quality issue at little or no cost.  He said he would like to 
prepare us an outline of an offer. to which I responded that he had nothing 
to lose by doing so.  The usual practice has been for Enron to do this and 
for El Paso to respond with "I don't think that will work".

Mr. Varagona also indicated that he did not see how the Letter Agreement/Term 
Sheet could form the basis of the commercial arrangement between our 
respective companies - "It just won't work!".  As a consequence, he stated 
that Clarke Smith, head of El Paso Merchant Energy, has already contacted or 
will shortly contact our Mike McConnell to see if they can work to resolve 
this matter. Apparently, these gentlemen have developed a good working 
relationship over the years.  He also alluded to the possibility that Mr. 
Smith may have also contacted our Stan Horton (for less than obvious reasons 
to me).  

Mr. Varagona further advised me that a Duke/Williams joint venture had just 
acquired the rights to the Gulfstream Pipeline Project from Coastal 
(divestment of this asset was required, I understand, as part of the El 
Paso/Coastal merger).  "This situation gives added impetus to development of 
the Cypress Pipeline project by Enron and El Paso."


There is considerable merit in Enron retaining the right to market its own 
gas out of the Elba Island LNG Terminal.  However, we may find it desirable 
to reach some commercial resolution with El Paso Merchant Energy for a 
portion of our volumes that also makes the quality issue disappear.  However, 
should we decide to so compromise, we must either fully engage Southern LNG 
in that solution or totally eliminate them from all aspects of our agreement 
with El Paso.  In the case of Southern LNG, we are dealing with one or more 
individuals who see only one way to do things. namely their way, and who are 
totally opposed to working with Enron.  I would recommend any compromise with 
El Paso Merchant Energy be conditioned on first reaching agreement with 
Southern LNG on explicit terms acceptable to us (and checking it twice).


I would appreciate receiving your comments, if any, before Thanksgiving.

Regards.
Les Webber

To which address should we send?

Dave,
     As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for
the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is
the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant
delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore,
please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for
execution by Enron.

Per our conversation today, I made a change to the "exhibit B"
confirmation.
If you could let me know that it's OK, we will make change and execute.

Walter,
 I do not think that they reviewed the language with their legal group.  They 
just did a cut of the revised document we sent to them.  As cut the language 
makes no sense.  Their is no connection between the Financial Statements and 
the Confidential Information.    Additionally their is no term.  As 
redrafted, the document is totally unacceptable.  Please tell them we need to 
go back to the Enron response document which we previously provided.  Thank 
you.

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Subject: Export of Gas From Alberta

If ECTR is buying gas in Alberta you should be aware that that the Alberta 
Energy Utilities Board has permitting and reporting requirements for gas 
produced in and exported from Alberta.   

The AEUB is quite flexible on who has to hold the permit and report the 
exports.  Either the buyer or seller can hold the permit and do the 
reporting.  At the present time ECTR does not hold an AEUB Blanket Export 
Permit (ECT Canada does but obviously ECTR volumes cannot be reported under 
the ECT Canada permit).  Therefore if ECTR is buying Alberta gas then it 
needs to do one of two things: (a) agree with its counterparty that it will 
report the exports under its AEUB permit, or (b) instruct me to get a blanket 
permit in the name of ECTR (and then have Juanita Marchand in Houston do the 
reporting for ECTR under this permit).

Please let me know if this is an issue that requires my attention.

Subject: Import of Canadian Gas into the U.S.

I was recently contacted by Juanita Marchand who does all the reporting of 
Canadian exports under ECTR's NEB Export Licences and U.S. DoE Import 
Authorizations out of Houston.   You guys need to advise Juanita of all of 
the points at which you are importing Canadian gas into the U.S. so she can 
ensure ECTR's total export/import volumes are correct.  She will call you to 
get this info from you.

Also, Juanita is reporting all the volumes you export/import under ECTR's NEB 
Short Term Blanket Permit GO-75-98 and its U.S. DoE Blanket Authorization 
1323.  If you enter into any term deals that are longer than two years you 
should advise me of this so we can consider whether the deal should be 
supported by its own NEB and U.S. DoE permit.

Thanks.

Dan,

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks,

Basically the intent of this condition is as follows:  On the replacement 
gas, we will purchase or sell this gas based on a GDDI but in the event that 
this index is unavailabe at the time of the transaction or the index has 
separated from the fixed price for that day then the counterparties have 
agreed that we can buy/sell on a fixed price.  In either scenerio, when ECC 
is acting as the agent, we shall be held harmless from a price exposure..

Subject: Enron NA transactions with TransCanada Gas Services

Anthony:

Due to the sale of TransCanada Gas Services by TransCanada PipeLines
Limited, TransCanada would like to propose moving the transactions
listed below from an unsigned buy/sell to a signed GISB contract between
the parties dated March 2, 1999.  TransCanada is not optimistic that the
buy/sell will be signed prior to the closing date of the sale of
TransCanada's gas marketing business, and feels it would be in the best
interest of both parties to move these trades to a signed agreement,
rather than letting them continue under unsigned paper.

Enron reference number:

QF7769.1/526974 (TC reference #277157)
QF8940.1/527655 (TC reference #277158)
QG6978.1/533356 (TC reference #277455)
704599 (TC reference #277703)
1122197 (TC reference #293254)

TransCanada would appreciate Enron's consideration of transferring the
following deals as well, although I do not have Enron's reference number
for these transactions (I will fax copies of TransCanada's confirms, if
that would be useful):

TC274748:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Niagara); trade date - 11/08/00
TC276714:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 12/05/00
TC278366:  Nov/01 - Apr/02 TC sells 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 12/26/00
TC284004:  Nov/01 - Apr/02 TC buys 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 12/01/00
TC297698:  June/01 - Nov/01 TC sells 5,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 05/15/01
TC298717:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 2/21/01
TC298720:  Apr/01 - Nov/01 TC buys 10,000 MMBtu @ NYMEX last day (@
Dawn); trade date - 02/22/01

I believe Enron originally proposed the buy/sell agreement for these
transactions due to their duration or perhaps because at their trade
dates, their start dates were in some cases more than 6 months out.  The
signed GISB between the parties includes special conditions which make
the GISB contract more suitable for term trades than an unaltered GISB.
For this reason, and because most of these transactions are now flowing,
I am hopeful that Enron will be agreeable to moving these trades to the
signed GISB, so that the unsigned buy/sell file may be closed.

Thank you for your consideration of this matter.  My telephone number is
403.213.5621.  After June 8th I will be away from the office on
maternity leave.  In my absense, please contact Brent Ohr by email at
the address given above, or by telephone at 403.920.5662.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price?

=20
pay advice throughout the year.  (Note that your W2 at the end of the year=

removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more

My last communication with Monica's attorney was that he was satisfied with 
our responses to his request and that he was going to run the contract 
through other groups at the city and would get back to us.  I can insert the 
last wording change in the previous draft that I had provided to the parties 
if you think that will speed up their attorney's signoff.
Attached is the final version of the contract.  Please feel free to forward 
it to Monica.  If they are agreeable, please have them accept the red-line 
changes, print 2 originals, sign and forward to Enron for final execution.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim

Christian,
 I believe this is covered because the language states that if the 25th is 
not a 
Business Day, the payment will be due the next Business Day.  Business Day is 
a defined term as a day when the Federal Reserve Banks is New York are open 
for business.  I cannot agree to a Customer's Business Day because it is not 
a defined term and may differ from the standard definition of Business Day.  
Therefore that change should not be incorporated.  Do you agree?

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Julie,

Attached is a list of 89 HPL Resources Company contracts that were active in 
the Global Contracts database on 3/17/2001.  Please determine:

1.  Which contracts will be needed to continue business after the expected 
6/1/2001 sale of HPL to AEP.  

2.  Which contracts are no longer used and can be terminated immediately.

3.  Which contracts will be needed to conduct intercompany business until 
5/31/2001, but will no longer be needed after the expected 6/1/2001 sale of 
HPL to AEP.

If appropriate, we should attempt to have as many of the type 2 contracts (no 
longer used) terminated at the end of this month on 3/31/2001.

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

comments, I would be happy to talk with them directly.  I understand that you

financial derivatives and commodities (both of which will be executed with 
Enron North America Cop. as the counterparty) and to add a $50,000,000

Thank you for making these changes so quickly.  I failed to ask you to
include one other item in the Transaction Agreement.  I would like to you to
specify that Rhodia does have trigger rights and that there are no minimum
volumes required to trigger.  Once you add that info and email the revised
Transaction Agreement back to my attention, I will be able to forward to

 Try the transport group, Steve VanHooser, Gerald Nemec, Eric Gillaspie, and 
maybe Shonnie Daniel.  I did not assign any transport contracts, especially

from HPLR to ECT eff. on 10/1/98 for a transportation contract with Texas 
Utilities Fuel Company.  However, we have been unable to locate the paper

I appreciate your help in locating this document.

Gerald,
 Please comment on section 1.6 of the attached document.  I am concerned that 
we might be on the hook for a reimbursement for periods beyond the Term.  Can 
this happen?  If so, is the language in the second attachment sufficient?

Russell, 

This is regarding our agreement to do a reciprocal US$ 25 million guaranty to 
cover Engage US only for PHYSICAL transactions.? Please let me know which are 
the Enron entities that need to be included in the Guaranty.? As soon as I 
have that information, I will forward the request to our Treasury, who will 
then arrange for internal approvals and then send you a draft guaranty for 
approval.

Dave,
 I have taken your word file that you forwarded to Travis McCullough and 
merged it into the Amendment that I had previously forwarded.  The only item 
that needs explanation is your comment concerning Paragraph 11.4.  The signed 
version of the contract that was provided after signature by Charlotte goes 
directly from the SDP language to paragraph 11.5.  As such I would like the 
language inserted that you indicate is already in the contract.  I agree that 
the language was in the versions prior to the final version.  Please call me 
at (713)853-6895 if you have any questions.  If not, please have PG&E sign 
two copies and forward to me.  I will have them signed by ENA and will return 
a fully executed original for your files.

		 Subject: FW: [Fwd: Puppies 4 Sale]






A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".

The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"

The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."

The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you."

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.




A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.

SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

Dan,

I hope that the contract comparison I sent you on 3/21 was useful.  I would
appreciate it if you could either call or email and let me know where the
contract review stands.  As I mentioned, we are targeting the end of this
week for contract execution; at a minimum, I would like to get a final
contract to you for execution.

Please call if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks!
Kim

If the deal is to be a fixed volume, I would prefer to use the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement and document the deal thereunder.  Please let me 
know.

Russell, Have you sent me a credit sheet on this?

John!

We are ok with the structure of the deal as discussed ( Purchase 4000 @ day 
MichCon @ NYMEX + 0.21(0.20) with an option to fix the price -  APR - OCT).  
However we would like to have this done under a contract. 

Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or a 
"Master Purchase, Sale".  


Thanks
Rudwell.

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

that I know will cause us problems is the posting of a bond.

Sunday really was good. We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed
it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have
one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else
she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.
I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of
her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she
has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy
a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he
went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it
herself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She still
thinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told us
again Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgot
the stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that. I'm open to
suggestions.

I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.

FEMALE HORMONES IN BEER

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that men should take a
look
at their beer consumption, considering the results of a recent analysis that

revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The theory is that
drinking
beer makes men turn into women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer each. It was then
observed that 100% of the men gained weight, talked excessively without
making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed to think rationally,
argued over nothing and refused to apologize when wrong. No further testing
is
planned.

Ellen,
 The enovate office in Chicago tells me that the addresses in the Contract 
are correct as written and that they have gotten with the people in Houston 
to get them to leave the addresses as contained in the contract.  Regarding 
the Financially Firm language, I would suggest that you line through the word 
Financially in each case where it occurs in the contract, line through the 
entire definition of Financially Firm and have the person who signs for 
Reliant initial each of the line outs.   I do not feel that we need to define 
the term Firm.  Our view of the contract is that the obligations are always 
firm so no further clarification is needed.  Do you concur?  If so, forward 
the signed and initialled contracts together with the signed Transaction 
Agreements and I will have the enovate officer also initial the line outs and 
return a final fully executed contract to you.

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

We need to make a decision on what to do?  Should we ask Entex to bear this 
cost, since this is their customer?  What is our commitment to Entex on 
facilities to industrial customers, as I do not think it is addresses in our 
contract with ENA?  Dan, what are your thoughts?

I visited with Mr. Bruce Lilly, Foreman for the San Jacinto River Authority, 
yesterday to discuss the possibility of HPL leaving the 2" NGO pipeline on 
the wooden supports that cross the San Jacinto River Authority's fresh water 
canal behind the NGO  plant.  Mr. Lilly's response to my request was no, the 
River Authority will not agree to allow the wooden supports to remain under 
any circumstance.  The River Authority believes the existing crossing is a 
hindrance to their operation and maintenance of the canal and they want it 
removed.  ExxonMobil's design for the new concrete crossing allows the River 
Authority to operate and maintain the canal with fewer obstacles.

You asked me the term of OxyChem's Natural Gas Odorizer's committment to 
Entex.  I don't know the answer - I'll have to contact OxyChem to find out.  
But I'm not ready to do that yet - I don't want to stir the waters until we 
have more information on this line relocation.  I would rather Entex 
contacted NGO first, once we have figured out what we will do.  Does anybody 
know the term and nature of HPL's committment to Entex with respect to NGO?

Whats the load to NGO?  If, as I now am finding out, it is apparently 
insignificant and we find that we have very few rights to claim a) 
compensation or b) staying where we are versus moving at our cost then maybe 
we just dont continue service.  John is working on the ROW issues and we'll 
soon get more educated.

Subject: Re: Natural Gas Odorizers - Baytown feed to Entex

Too much missing information!  For what reason is Exxon installing a new pipe 
support structure across the San Jacinto Water Canal?  Is it in poor 
condition and needs to be replaced, thus mandating our need to move?  Is the 
Water Authority requiring the move and why?  Is the existing structure going 
to stay and is that acceptable to the Water Authority and Exxon?  Will Exxon 
allow us to remain in the same location even though they are building a new 
structure?  What is the condition of our pipe on the existing rack?  Don't we 
already have a permit with the Water Authority for the existing pipeline?  Is 
the Water Authority a City of Baytown organization and therefore falls within 
the City's control on franchise permits, fees, issues, etc?  

Once you have the answers to the above questions, then get us together so we 
can formulate a plan.  Lee, what is the existing term of their commitment to 
Entex?  Is Oxy OK with a short term shut down to get all this connected once 
in place or do they need continuing operations?  Due to the time constraints 
on replacement, we need quick answers.  Brad, you are on point to quickly 
pull this together.

I have spoke to both Tom Shelton and Dan Hyvl about the franchise tax 
situation with the city of Baytown.  Tom referred me to Dan.  Dan said that 
as long as HPL does not need to get a permit from the City of Baytown to 
either cross a public road or to cross the San Jacinto Water Authority water 
canal, then we would be okay.  I do not believe that any relocation will 
involve a new road crossing, and if it turns out that we need to get a permit 
from the City of Baytown to cross the water canal, then we should ask either 
Exxon or Entex to get that permit.  If we plan to take this NGO business from 
Entex, then we need to work with Exxon.  Exxon did offer to construct HPL's 
2" line across the new bridge.  If HPL is going to replace the line, then we 
might take Exxon up on this offer since they would have to get all the 
permits for this work.  Those permits would, of course, need to be 
transferrable to the owner and operator of the pipeline, which, in the end, 
would be HPL.

FYI - Natural Gas Odorizers is wholly owned by OxyChem, a large industrial 
customer (over 100,000/d total in Texas) with several plants that HPL serves 
(I am the OxyChem rep).  Two years ago, OxyChem tried very hard to get HPL to 
connect to them directly and cut out Entex, but we did not do it because of 
the franchise tax issue.  The last OxyChem rep was fairly p.o.'d about us not 
connecting.

So, we would score lots of points with OxyChem (as in, more business at the 
large volume plants) if we could connect directly to them,  What's our next 
step?

Please include me in any meetings

We should seriously question why HPL should pay for the relocation of the NGO 
line as referenced in the report attached.  Entex gets the full benefit of 
this customer and probably should fund this project.  If they won't, then 
maybe we should pursue this customer direct while we are in the progress of 
replacing the pipeline.  We probably also have franchise related issues with 
the City of Baytown on this.  Tom, please determine what course of action we 
need to take from a franchise perspective.  Then call a meeting of the above 
group along with Blevins and Ducote (if appropriate).

Dan,

 The two deals mentioned below are deal #s 97154 & 97077 under contract 
96022216.  Entex has already paid this invoice in full.  Let me know if there 
is anything needed on my end to get these deals corrected, if needed.

Thanks,
Kyle

Kyle,
 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

Kim,
 This appears a little too iffy.  Please get with SCGC to find out the notice 
period. If it is greater than 10 days then we will change our language to the 
greater notice period.  If less, we will leave our notice period at 10 days 
prior to the month.  Please call if you would care to discuss.

Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - "subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements."

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

Mr. Hyvl,

I added Section 8.9 in your CPS file below incorporating "Utilization of
Small Business Concerns," a clause we are required as a municipality to
incorporate in all of our contracts.  I added it with the Word tracking
feature "in red" so you would not have to type it in yourself.  Let me know
if it causes your company any qualms.

As far as your question regarding purchase orders, all of our purchases from
Enron will reference the same purchase order so that you may use the same
number on each invoice.

Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...

of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

A couple of changes need to be made:

? Les thought we should add Enron LNG Marketing LLC as a signature party.  
Will having just ENA cover us?  If not, do we need to have both ENA and Enron 
LNG be named throughout the document?
? typo on Southern on 2nd and 3rd page titles.

     Gary,

     I am pleased to accept the offer Mr. Stephen Schneider extended to us
     yesterday during our meeting in Baytown.

     We calculate the damages you offered to reimburse us for to be $27,749

     As we discussed, this is for repairing the actual damage done to the
     plant, and does not include any off spec or lost production issues.

     Please give me a call and we can discuss how you would like to handle
     the conclusion of this matter.

     Thank you for helping solve this issue.

     Best Regards,

     Bobby Combs

Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP 
who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties, 
Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount 
that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at

Sandi,

The deal David is referencing relates to an unbooked traunch under contract 
96001783.   This traunch had not previously been booked because the contract 
had had a price re-opening provision.  I'm fairly certain contract 96001783 
is already included in the data room documentation.

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

Attached is the notice letter we discussed.  I believe it is intended to 
support our position (which is the correct one) that the monies which SECLP 
expects to realize shortly should be paid to cover past due fuel invoices 
rather than replenish the debt reserve account.

I shall appreciate your providing me with your comments, modifications.

 By copy of this e-mail, I'm asking Margaret Doucette, my assistant,  to 
clean up the formatting and complete the addresses, etc. 
 
Thanks for your help.

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Dave,
 I will be glad to generate the form of Transaction Agreement; however, I 
have a number of questions.
1.  Relationship of Delivery Point and the use of Interruptible Transport on 
Northwest Pipeline.  Is the transport upstream or downstream of the delivery 
point?  If downstream, why isn't it being contracted for by EWEB.  
2.  What volume is being sold each day.  You use the term DCQ and you also 
talk about a 20% tolerance above or below the estimated quantity.  Normally 
their would be no tolerance with a DCQ transaction.  
3.  Is this envisioned to be a requirements transaction.  Is the price the 
same for volumes in excess of the estimated quantity up to an additional 
20%.  Is no penalty to apply if the actual volumes are 0% to 20% less than 
the estimated quantity?  What if they take more than 20% in excess without 
making any arrangements for incremental gas.  What price is to be used for 
such non scheduled excess volumes? 
 Please call me regarding the foregoing so that I can start to work on the 
transaction agreement.

The attached term sheet describes a gas sale we are proposing to the Eugene 
Water and Electric Board.  Please have a look and let me know how you think 
the actual confirm should look.  They have an Enfolio in legal review now.

Barbara,
 Tom Martin called and said it was his understanding that he could buy gas at 
any EOL point such as Exxon Katy, Waha or Carthage for any term and that he 
could resell such gas into HPL.  I explained to him that the EOL carve out 
was for transactions of less than one month.  He asked if you could call him 
if his understanding was incorrect and then he asked if you wouldn't mind 
just calling him to discuss the matter.

Dan,

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan
so he can make these changes (I was only provided
hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

Dan and Michelle;

Further to Bruce's note the other day,  could we use something like the
following in the two Enron/CEMC agreements? - to be inserted in Other
Conditions immediately following the para. providing for the 9:45
notification.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the Enfolio Spot
General Terms and Conditions each party shall, in addition to the other
remedies hereunder, be liable to reimburse the other for any imbalance
charges, loan costs, or similar charges reasonably incurred by the other as
a result of the failure:

a) in the case of Enron, to provide the delivery information required by
9:45 am on each Nomination Day; and

b) in the case of Customer, to forward such information to Alliance Pipeline
on each Nomination Day in a timely manner.

A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully 
interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they 
limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day 
month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all 
business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that 
would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately 
supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a 
increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.

Subject: RE: Physical Contracts


Phil,

Thank you for your explanation of the billing process.  Your email raised
some questions for us.

Specifically, we do not understand your statement that the GISB is an
interruptible contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.

The GISB form you mailed us is similar to GISB's which we have received from
other companies.  All specifically state in the bottom disclaimer paragraph
of the first page that "This Contract is intended for Interruptible
transactions or Firm transactions of one month or less and may not be
suitable for Firm transactions of longer than one month."  Further, in the
interior of the GISB, on Exhibit A, there is a place to check whether one
wants firm or interruptible.

The intent of this email is to clarify.  Our interpretation is that GISBs
can be for firm (which is what we would want to do), and they would be for
31 day months as well as 30 day or less. Do you agree with this?

If our interpretation is correct, it is not clear why a Master Firm is
needed.  Can you explain what the value add is to our doing business?
[Perhaps it would be useful for a case where we wanted to cover our long
term purchases for a combined cycle plant which we intended to operate every
day of the year other than scheduled maintenance outages.]

Lastly, in our notes from our meeting, I wrote that Enron had offered an
initial $20MM credit line for Oglethorpe. When doing physical contracts
either under a GISB or your Master Firm, does this amount represent a Mark
to Market limit or a nominal limit?

We have our people reviewing GISB, ISDA, and Master Firm as I write this. We
look forward to your responses.

Hey Laurence,

Good meeting you and Larry yesterday.   I think we had some good discussion
yesterday and it seems like we have some things we can work on together.

As far as the contracts, a couple of clarifications and an answer to your
question below.

You should have received a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement via email
and hard copy.  Additionally, you have already received  a GISB contract
and a ISDA Agreement.  Here is a brief description of what each of them do:

   GISB - Gas Industry Standards Board Agreement - this is an interruptible
   contract for gas supply that is 30 days or less.  OPC would not be able
   to lock forward NYMEX prices on this contract but can purchase short
   term supplies.
   ISDA - this contract is for financial positions only.  If you wanted to
   enter into swaps or derivative based products, you can perform them
   under this contract without ever having to take physcial delivery.
   Master Firm - Under this contract, OPC will be purchasing firm gas
   supply and will be able to lock forward values on the NYMEX.  Note that
   this is a physcial contract which will require OPC to take delivery.
   OPC will receive a bill from Enron around the 5th after the month of
   delivery and will be required to pay no later than the 25th.  If the
   25th is on a weekend or holdiay, then the invoice will be due on the
   next business day.  OPC payment obligations are always after the month
   of delivery no later than the 25th with no need for any payments
   beforehand.  Note that under Triggering Event in Section 4.2, either
   party may need to provide additional credit assurances in the event of a
   material change which could cause a letter of credit to be issued.

Let me know if you did not receive the Master Firm Agreement or if you have
any more questions.

Thanks.

Phil DeMoes

Phil,

One quick question we forgot to ask yesterday.  If OPC were to to place an
order for physical contract for a delivery month of this summer,  when
would
we have to pay for this?  Would it be so many days after the end of the
month in which
received, etc? Would there be any cash due upon placing the order?

Russell,
 Please review the attached draft of the draft Enfolio Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale Agreement which has been drafted based on Exxon's comments as 
necessary changes before they will allow the Mobil plant to schedule gas 
under the terms of the October 1, 1995 Agreement.  I have merely incorporated 
the credit language that was used in the October 1, 1995 agreement into this 
agreement and have attempted to make the other changes that Exxon was 
requesting.  Question, is the parent company still Mobil Corp. for the 
purposes of the MAC.  Do you still agree with the prior credit requirements 
as provided in the October 1, 1995 agreement, and if not, please provide me 
with your updated requirements as early as possible this morning so that I 
can incorporate into the agreement prior to presenting it to them for further 
negotiation later today.

Lee,
 Please review the attached so that we can discuss which of their changes 
have been made, which we did not make and the reasons therefor.  The quick 
points being:  sentence at end of 2.3 which takes the place of their items 
1-4; $0.15 to $0.05 in 3.2 and 3.4; item (iii) in 4.2 per their request #5 
except I changes 30 business days to simply 30 days; I did not give them 
their request #6 except I did incorporate the last two sentences of their 
request; I attempted to give them all of their requested #7 except I reworded 
slightly for balance and the items we previously discussed; did not do 
request #8 because we will incorporate that in the Transaction Agreement; 
gave them their request #9, gave them their request #10 except I left in the 
"as is, where is" and the line they omitted when they retyped; did not do 
their item #11, added section 8.9 for termination of prior agreement; added 
their items #12 and #13 but modified as we discussed; otherwise I updated the 
contract and changed references for Buyer's Transporter to simply Company.  
Anything else?

Grant,
 I do not think that their new language will work in the way they think it 
will.  What Bruce indicated to me was that if they determined that they had 
volumes after 9:00 they would offer to us.  If we didn't accept, then they 
wanted the right to go to another market which might be in the Chicage area.  
 My understanding of this deal was that we were only obligated to take 
volumes if they were nominated before 9:00.  Is that correct?  Please call me 
so that we can discuss.

Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

Dan:

Attached is the revised EPOS consent (this is in acrobat format so I could 
not just send you the EPOS consent, just ignore the Enron Corp Consent).  
Unfortunately, Davis Polk made our requested changes in the first pages of 
the document and they stop making changes after page 5.  The important change 
is on f) of the definition of Enforcement Transfer.  I would like to ask you 
to look at this and just assume the other changes will be made.  Also, and 
most importantly, I think we need to discuss how EPOS wants to deal with this 
consent and the assignment.   Assuming that our commercial people will talk 
to Doug tomorrow, I suggest you and I talk to decide how to address the 
issues resulting from having the assignment and the Consent (maybe we should 
put them both in one document) and obviously the guarantees that should 
disappear if Epos assigns the contracts as collateral.

Please give me a call tomorrow to discuss.

Thanks

THE NEW NEWLYWEDGAME
 submitted by MeanBabaJean

This couple had only been married for two weeks. The husband, although very 
much in love, couldn't wait to go out into town and party with his old 
buddies, so he says to his new wife, "Honey, I'll be right back..."?

"Where are you going Coochy Cooh...?" asked the wife.?

"I'm going to the bar, Pretty Face. I'm going to have a beer."?

The wife says to him, "You want a beer my love?" Then she opens the door to 
the refrigerator and shows him 25 different kinds of beer brands from 12 
different countries: Germany, Holland, Japan, India, etc.?

The husband doesn't know what to do, and the only thing that he can think of 
saying is, "Yes, Honey Pie...but the bar you know...the frozen glass..."?

He didn't get to finish the sentence, when the wife interrupts him by 
saying,"You want a frozen glass Puppy Face?" She takes a mug out of the 
freezer so frozen that she was getting chills holding it.?

The husband, looking a bit pale, says, "Yes, Tootsie Roll, but at the bar 
they have those hors d'oeuvres that are really delicious... I won't be long 
I'll be right back. I promise. OK?"?

"You want hors d'oeuvres Pookie Pooh?" She opens the oven and takes out 15 
dishes of different hors d'oeuvres: chicken wings, pigs in a blanket, 
mushroom caps, pork strips, etc.?

"But Sweetie, Honey...at the bar...you know...the swearing, the dirty words 
and all that. .."?

"You want dirty words Cutie Pie?..HERE, DRINK YOUR F*****G BEER IN YOUR 
FROZEN F*****G MUG AND EAT YOUR F*****G SNACKS, BECAUSE YOU AREN'T GOING 
ANYWHERE! GOT IT A*****E?!!"


Subject: FW: Fw: HER BALLONS



    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Dan - 

Are you red-lining the Master Kim Decell sent over? (since she won't go 
revert to the currently negotiated version).  If so, can you forward me a 
copy?

Thanks

Larry,

Thank you to you and your team for allowing us the opportunity to come and
present.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner, my attempt to
track down information on Enron and an ammonia forward market has not as of
yet yielded results (I will continue to investigate).

Pursuant to the decision to focus initially financial hedging, risk
management strategies, and to understand Mississippi Chemical's risk
appetite and hedging objectives,  I offer the following questions:

1.  Historically, what percentage of your natural gas consumption have you
hedged?  Are your required to have a specific percentage of your exposure
hedged, with hedge levels depending differing time horizons?
2.  What policies/procedures govern what you can and cannot do with respect
to hedging instruments?
3.  What is Mississippi Chemical's position on transacting over-the-counter
swaps and options?  Is their any policy which requires you to transact on
the exchange?
4.  How far out on the curve can you hedge?
5.  What is the appropriate conversion factor to be used to calculate
natural gas per ton of product produced (our estimate is 25 MMBtu/ton)?
6.  What Green Markets posting (or other postings) are your products tied
to?  If your products are sold based on forward contracts, what is the
normal term of such contracts?  If sold on spot, to what index(es) are they
tied?
7.  What is your internal price forecast for the price of ammonia for the
next year, 2 years, etc?

Hopefully I am not asking for anything too difficult to obtain.  I do
realize we may need to get a confidentiality agreement in place to protect
the transferral of sensitive information.  Please let me know how to
proceed.

Best regards,

Troy Black

We are going to use our contract for the 3 month deal, so what you have given 
me is fine for that.  For the longer term deal, they want to start with their 
contract.  So, please review it over the next few weeks to be ready for their 
next deal starting Feb 1.

Chris,
 The above document is the November 17, 1999 document which has been changed 
to a 3 month deal with the price change you specified.  I have received the 
copy of the type of contract that they would like us to use.  I note that we 
will have to make a lot of changes which is probably not warranted for a 3 
month deal.  If you want us to consider using their form for a long term 
deal, I will start making the necessary changes and send you back a red-lined 
single transaction contract.  Will the long term deal have the same terms as 
our last long term deal except for price?

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen

Debra,
 I have looked over the cancelled GISB that CES tried to put in place with 
FGU.  Nothing in there of note.  Therefore, please prepare our standard GISB, 
do not use any of their language.  When it is ready, please email to Michelle 
Klein and to Jared Kaiser .

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

Jason --

Attached are draft transaction agreements for the on and off peak periods for 
the months
of November and December.  Regarding the side letter agreement which 
addresses the
end of the quarter true-up calculation for negative monthly revenue sharing 
amounts, it is
Enron's desire to include this calculation in these transaction agreements.  
We propose
the language as shown in the attached transaction agreements.  It will permit 
that the 
true-up calculation will occur whether or not the December Off Peak 
Transaction is done.

Please call me if you have any other comments and changes at 713-853-1667.

Sorry for the delay,

Ruth

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

        Thanks for the quick response.  The issue under consideration is
     one of
        eligibility.  The risk profile of existing trades is not a primary
        concern. Under US derivative law, customers must have $10MM total
     assets
        or $1MM shareholder equity or be guaranteed by such an entity or
     post
        cash/LCs in amounts reasonably approximating risk potential.
     Because
        ENA is a US registered company and its subsidiary, Enron Capital &
     Trade
        Resources International Corp. is a US registered company and both
        entities are trading derivatives with Total International, we must
        establish eligibility under one of the above criterion before
     trading
        any futher.  Again, credit risk of existing trades is not
     considered the
        issue.  Satisfaction of eligiblity criterion is the issue.  To this
        point, Total International has not guaranteed this entity and no
        financial statements have been provided. We must somehow work
     together
        to satisify these eligibility concerns.  Let me know what you
     think.  Or
        better yet, give me a call, 713-853-9897.

Here are revised draft transaction agreements for September and October.  I 
believe
that we have revised all the small volume changes that are indicated on the 
schedule
that I just sent out.

Also, attached is a revised set of GSA procedures that incorporate Marty's 
quick comments
on Bullet Point #5 under the GSA Daily Nomination section.

I have made some changes in the attached draft.  I do not think there should 
be another entry relative to the data room or divestiture, as it would 
certainly put a damper on the celebration.  Brian, I am sure that will be a 
topic of potential discussion, one that you need to be prepared to address.

Good Morning - As you're aware, we will be producing a  souvenir booklet on 
HPL for the anniversary party and I want to include another  entry under 2000 
that indicates the start of a new era since HPL has a data room  open.? I 
would appreciate your thoughts on how to word that.? Thanks,  Elaine

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Dan,

What is our status with the Palo Alto Agreement?  According to Monica, they 
are waiting on a final copy with the language that has been agreed to by both 
parties.  She is ready to sign.  I know that we have lost one transaction due 
to paper not being in place.  Can you send me the final document and I will 
forward to Monica?

Also, can we discuss El Paso on Tuesday?

Thanks,

Kim

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

		 Subject: Mesa Restructure

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

Susan,
 I agree with you. Use the CES GISB for EOL transactions.

Not sure who's available for this, but here goes.

Mississippi Valley Gas Company has shown up for review in EOL.  There are two 
executed masters.  One is a CES GISB (96028960) dated 1/1/98.  The other is 
our MPSF (96001043) dated 1/1/93.

My vote is for the CES GISB.  Can I please get an official call on the best 
one for EOL, including collateral language?  They are attached for your 
review.

Thanks!!

Susan

Dan,

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan
so he can make these changes (I was only provided
hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

r

CBS is showing "Survivor 2" this winter. In response, Texas is planning
"Survivor, Texas Style."

The contestants will start in Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San
Antonio, down to Houston and Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio,
on to El Paso, then to Midland/Odessa, up to Lubbock and Amarillo. From
there, they proceed to Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.

Each will be driving a pink Volvo, with a bumper sticker that reads "I'm
gay, I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."

The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.

Attached please find a red-line of the changes for the referenced proposal.  
Please review and let me have your comments.  I had to start from scratch.   
I limited this to a single transaction as provided in the proposal.  You may 
recall that you had requested Debra to convert the single proposal into a 
Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement so that it could be utilized by adding 
future transactions by way of a Confirmation Letter.  The short review time 
to get something in place will not permit the global changes which may be 
necessary to cover all the points to make the proposal into a Master.

Dan-

I appreciate the effort you are making and I realize you, and everyone else,
have a lot on your plate.  However, Enron has had a general base contract
since mid-August and a draft Enron-specific contract since mid-September.
We are now 2 weeks from the contract start and you've indicated that a great
deal of work is still needed.

I've reviewed an Enron North America sample contract and I do not see
significant, irresolvable differences.  Furthermore, I had hoped my
voicemail offer to you this morning to remove all references to Locked
Prices would further minimize our differences.  I will be in tomorrow,
except for approximately 9-12, and will be available to discuss our options.
I do not think a GISB contract attached to the term sheet is an acceptable
alternative.  I would be more than happy to come downtown next week and
spend as much time as needed to hammer out the issues.

Thanks in advance for your help.

Karen,
     I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time
on.  It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will
continue to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing
and I need to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as
possible.  If we need to put something in place before the contract is
executed, maybe we can document the transaction under the existing GISB
contract currently in place between the parties and agree that the
transaction will be rolled up under the new master once the Master is
executed.

Is it Steve's call to eliminate new sales stations when Entex is ECT's 
customer?  I would think that this would be Jim's call and I don't recall him 
running any economics on Pheasant Creek City Gate station.

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several 
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since 
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Can you please take a look at Tenaska's incoming gty format, as their 
guarantor has changed and subsequently new gty's need to be issued for both 
ENA and ECC.  As the current gty's expire at the end of the month, it is 
imperative that we give Tenaska feedback as soon as we are able to in order 
to have the gty's executed on their end.  The gty format is attached in the 
email below.

Thanks again for your prompt attention,

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Clement, Dan,

Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the 
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec.. 
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not 
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept 
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally thought 
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

Thanks

Subject: RE: Pending Guaranty for Physical Business




Russell, 

We looked at the revised redline on the Enron physical business sent by you 
on Dec 21st 00. 

We have the following important comments: 

(1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be 
covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been 
signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not 
probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore 
we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations 
of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).

(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and 
sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had 
requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap 
be set for all entities.? 

(3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will 
supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage 
Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage 
Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed 
Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph ("insofar 
as it respects Contract Party").? This was deleted in your revised redline.

We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, if 
it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.

Please respond at your earliest convenience. 

Thanks 
Kiran

We have received your acceptance and you are confirmed for ClickAtHome Pilot 
2.

You will be notified with an e-mail by November 17th on how and when you can 
access the ordering web site. Ordering is not expected to
begin until December. 

As a pilot participant, you will be testing various aspects of this new 
program such as the program offerings, program communications, product and 
service ordering, vendor services and program support.  At this time, the 
pilot program is not intended to provide access to Enron's network for 
telework purposes.   If you need Enron access for business reasons, please 
continue to maintain your existing computer and connection for this purpose.  
 In advance, we appreciate your co-operation and patience under this pilot 
program.  

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  By participating the Pilot, 
you are not obligated to order hardware or connectivity, but will be given 
the opportunity to review your options and associated prices.

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on our web site.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot web site is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the web site, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.

Please send any questions to the clickathomepilot2@enron.com mailbox.

Thanks.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are having Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything further.

Mike,

Please see the attached L/C format to cover physical delivery of natural gas 
for one month.

As discussed, the L/C amount should be $1.6 million to expire Oct. 15, 2000.  
In addition the L/C should be in the name of Hilcorp Energy Company.  I also, 
left you an additional voice mail, stating that once we have received a faxed 
copy of the L/C from your bank, we will then be willing to flow gas.

Regards,
Russell

cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the 
confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal

No, The canadian contract is only for canadian business.  I do not recall the

No, maybe I am missing something.  Unless I am reading this incorrectly El 
Paso Merchant Energy Canada Inc. assigned all assests and contracts to El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P. effective 12/31/00, therefore assigning K#96054452 
(10/1/00).  My line of thinking is that we will still have two masters for El 
Paso.  Also, since the master was written to cover Canadian business wouldn't 
it make this K a little broader for all transactions?

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.

 To the best of my knowledge, we are not working on a contract with

about any contract drafts that the gas trader may have received and not

Jeanne,

As I explained to Terry on Monday or Tuesday, according to the notes within 
Global Contracts database, K#96030149 is an unexecuted contract and it 
currently has a status of expired .  Because of these factors, we suggested 
that the deal be re-entered and a GTC attached to it until a contract can be 
negotiated and executed.  

Unfortunately Global Contracts database is inoperative this morning so I 
cannot give you any further information regarding any other notes for that 
particular K#.  Please let me know if the suggestion that has been made is 
feasible. 

Dan- to the best of your knowledge, has there or will there be a contract 
drafted for Washington Energy?

Regards,
Bridgette

Bridgette  -    Please extend global contract #96030149  with Washington 
Energy.    This deal should be set up as a month-to-month evergreen (see note 
below from the trader - John Singer.)

Thanks.

Subject: Re: CGAS - Washington Energy Co - ? about deal  

Extend the deal as a month to month ( that would be the default of the 
assigned CES contract).  Price is 100% CGas Appalachian Index (no fixed 
price).  Gathering stays the same.

Subject: CGAS - Washington Energy Co - ? about deal

John - I am trying to cover to Terry who is out of the office for the rest of 
the week.      I am working on some issue with Gloria and I need your help on 
one:

The deal ticket (#226330)  for Washington Energy Company for purchases from 
meters 602368 and 602467 on CGAS was only set up through 10/31/00.    It had 
a fixed price of $2.91  with a gathering deduct of ($0.27).          Is ENA 
still purchasing this gas in November ?   What is the pricing structure 
?      I was reluctant to have Global contracts extend the existing contract 
with the fixed price without your approval.

Please let me know via email what the terms of this purchase deal should be 
going forward.

If you need to call me,  I am still working from home   281-286-7153     ( I 
will be gone from about 9:30 - 1:00 on Thursday for physical therapy)

Monica,
 I have made the changes we discussed yesterday.  Deletions are not shown, 
however, any new wording is shown in red.  I attempted to complete the 
reference to the Act by going to the California constitution for a site 
authorizating the existence of the City of Palo Alto.  If your outside 
counsel feels that this is incorrect, please have them furnish me with the 
proper reference.  If the agreement is in order, please print off two 
originals, have them signed and forward to Kim Ward for signature by ENA.

Brodgette.
 Below is the notification that I sent to Bob Bowen on 12/22 to let the 
confirm group know about the transaction agreement which has been signed by 
the customer.  I talked with Craig Breslau this afternoon and he said he 
would sign in behalf of ENA and sent to me asap.  As soon as I get the signed 
agreements, I will sent the confirm to Ellen Wallumrod and the contract to 
Cyndie Balfour-Flangan.  Any questions?

******************************************************************************
**************************************************************
The attached confirm has been signed and is being sent to me by federal 
express.  It did not arrive on Friday so it should be here next week.  I am 
sending you this in case you get a deal ticket for the deal being documented 
by this confirm.  They have  also signed a master to cover this transaction.

Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Regards,

I believe that the Crestar deal is almost finalized.  According to my 
records, Transaction Number NV8176/370753 was partially documeted with a GTC 
confirm (2000-087crfm.doc attached) dated January 4, 2001.  This covers a 
firm sale of 21,100 MMBtu by Crestar to ENA for the period November 1, 2000 
through October 31, 2001.  The remainder of Transaction Number NV8176/370753 
has been documented with two GTC confirms (2001-023crfm.doc and 
2001-023acrfm.doc also attached) dated March 22, 2001 (Revised).  
2001-023crfm covers the firm sale of 0 - 8,260 MMBtu per day for the period

Jeff,
 We talked about my joining HPL after the sale was consummated several weeks 
ago.  You had indicated that you would work up some information and send it 
to me.  Is it ready?  Gary Prescott and I have verbally agreed to a level of 
compensation which I understand you are working into a document.  He has also 
assured me that I will be credited with my initial start date which is March 
9, 1967 and be fully vested in the various benefit, retirement and vacation 
plans.  Can you confirm this?  Enron has indicated that since I am over 55, I 
will be fully vested in any unvested options, however, all of my options will 
need to be exercised on the earlier of the original expiration date or a date 
that is 3 years from the time I leave Enron's employment.  They indicated 
that it makes no difference if I retire or terminate.  I can see no benefit 
in retirement from Enron because I am currently vested in the savings plan 
which I will roll over to an investment account when I leave Enron and I see 
no reason to sign up for the Enron Retirement Health Benefits because AEP 
appears to have a similar retirement health benefit plan.  Isn't this the 
case?
 Please respond at your earliest opportunity so that I can better understand 
how I need to approach Enron concerning my possible departure from Enron for 
a career opportunity with HPL.

Debra, Stacy

Please read this long winded message:

Attached is a new credit worksheet for Engage Energy.  Please resend them the 
Master draft with the correct Guaranty amendments as I noted in the comments 
on the worksheet.  Debra, you commented in the Master Gas Lotus Notes 
Database that their legal is unwilling to sign a Master Firm.  I have talked 
to thier contracts person (the contact person listed on the credit w/s)  and 
I want this to get executed. Please proceed with this.

Thanks
Russell

Richard,
 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.  
Thank you.

Dave,
 As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for the 
applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is the 
Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant delivery 
point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore, please 
finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for execution by 
Enron.

Here is the latest version of AEC.  Please note the major changes in 
Paragraph 2.  Dan, please make sure the changes I have made are written in an 
acceptable legal format.

Also, I have made Paragraph 4 bi-lateral.

let me know your comments ASAP as I need to get this to AEC early Wednesday 
morning.

Also, we will need to incorporate the appropriate changes into the ECT/Citrus 
Agreement.

not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the

Dan -

I spoke with Rich Caruso, the CFO of Ormet Corporation, last Friday and he 
informed me that they had sent a Confidentiality Agreement to Enron for 
execution prior to releasing their financials.

Have you seen the Ormet CA, or are we still waiting on this to arrive?  If 
you HAVE received their CA, where do we stand on executing and sending it 
back to them?



Thanks,

Jay Williams

Doug:

Thank you for your e-mail.

I have no doubts you and your team did a great job and saved a lot of money 
to PQP and thus Enron.  Like you we are also trying our best to cut a good 
deal for Enron.  After talking to you and Dan last week I went back to the 
lenders trying to avoid the amendment to the fuel supply.  It looks like they 
may agree to live without this document.

If we can in fact convince the lenders I will not bother you and Dan again 
with this issue.

Thank you for your help.

I guess saving PQP LLC $14 million through the renegotiated fuel supply

Subject: Re: Amendment to Fuel Supply  

  Thank you for your e-mail with the draft of the amendment to the fuel 
supply agreement.  I disagree that the amendment has nothing to do with the 
1996 letter.  It is correct that the 1996 letter was superseded by the 
amended and restated fuel supply but the situation created by the 1996 letter 
was not contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  The lenders 
were not given a copy of the 1996 letter until recently and naturally asked 
to be in the same position created by the 1996 letter which was not 
contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  Notwithstanding the 
lenders strong case, I am still trying to argue this and many other issues 
and there is a slight possibility we may be able to convince the lenders they 
do not need this document.  

We will continue to do our best to protect Enron's interests (at all levels) 
in this highly complex and difficult financing.  As always, constructive 
criticism and suggestions to improve our work are very much appreciated.

I will keep you informed of further developments

Thank you

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist

superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

George,
 I would suggest that the necessary language be added to the Special 
Conditions block of the Transaction Confirmation.  I would suggest the 
following language be inserted in each applicable Transaction Confirmation.

"Notwithstanding anything to the contrary otherwise contained in the 
sentences previously added to the end of Section 13.5, the parties agree that 
the price to be applicable with regard to any volumes outside of the +/-10% 
tolerance shall be the Gas Daily "Daily Mid-point" price for the day 
following the day that the parties discover the existence of volumes outside

Russell,
 Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are 
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the 
guarantee, incoming or outgoing.  
 Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron 
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company 
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's 
new parent will need to take its place.  
 Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will 
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this 
takes the action of their spun off entity.

Clement,
 Do you agree?

Clement, Dan,

Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the 
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec.. 
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not 
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept 
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally thought 
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: RE: Pending Guaranty for Physical Business




Russell, 

We looked at the revised redline on the Enron physical business sent by you 
on Dec 21st 00. 

We have the following important comments: 

(1) The first page of the Guaranty refers to specific Contracts that will be 
covered by the Guaranty and one identified Contract is the Enfolio Master 
Firm Purchase/ Sale Agreement.? As you are aware, this Contract has not been 
signed between Coastal Merchant Energy and Enron companies and will not 
probably be signed (if and) until our pending merger is completed.? Therefore 
we request that the Guaranty language be broadened to include all Obligations 
of the Enron entities to CME (and not be Contract specific).

(2)The third page of the Guaranty discusses Maximum Limit (Section 2) and 
sets specific numerical caps for each of the covered Enron entities.? We had 
requested for a unified Cap earlier and once again request that a unified Cap 
be set for all entities.? 

(3)The fifth page of the Guaranty (Section 9), says that this Guaranty will 
supersede the Old Guaranty that was issued jointly to Engage US and Engage 
Canada.? As you are aware, we are not affiliated or connected with Engage 
Canada and therefore cannot bind Engage Canada whatsoever in the proposed 
Guaranty.? That was the rationale for our insert in that paragraph ("insofar 
as it respects Contract Party").? This was deleted in your revised redline.

We are anxious to complete this Guaranty as soon as possible.? We suggest, if 
it is necessary, a conference call involving ourselves and our Counsel.

Please respond at your earliest convenience. 

Thanks 
Kiran

John,
 My first question is how does Cutter determine Harley's volume?  This 
procedure should be added to the document providing for the fixed price.  Has 
Harley set up Cutter as his Seller's Representative so that he can provide us 
notices, volumes, statements and receive Harley payments?  If not, we should 
add that to the Harley agreement and have Cutter sign in the capacity of 
Seller's Representative.  Call me at (713) 853-6895 to discuss in further 
detail.

Dan,
Cutter Oil Company, one of my producers has a meter connected to a Columbia 
Gas Transmission line.  Harley Drilling & Producing is currently putting a 
small volume of gas through this meter.  I pay Cutter for all the flowing 
gas, Cutter then pays Harley for his portion.  Harley is wanting to lock-in a 
fixed price for a firm volume for part of his gas, about 40%-50%.  Cutter has 
in the past locked-in fixed prices for firm volumes and most likey will do so 
in the future.  

Two producers, Cutter Oil & Harley Drilling, wanting to lock-in fixed prices 
for firm volumes for gas flowing through one meter owned by Cutter Oil:
Is there a method to lock-in a portion of Harley's production at a fixed 
price which flows through Cutter's meter?
What contractual language needs be added to the ENFOLIO GAS PURCHASE 
AGREEMENT?
Should an addendum be added to both contracts (Harley and Cutter)?

John

I am assuming we have not heard anything from Cage, and it has been 12 days

Grant,
 I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do 
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the 
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
 1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
 2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the 
contract would be executed by the City.
 3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
 4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency 
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a 
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
 5. I have added the word "reasonable".
 6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided, 
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement 
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the 
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination 
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be 
necessary to attain closure.
 7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be 
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's 
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend 
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was 
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was 
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
 8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a 
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article 
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default 
extends for more than 5 days during any month. 
 9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate 
rating applies to ENA.
 10. I have changed "a" to "the"
 11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of 
Force Majeure.
 12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due 
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language 
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a 
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
 13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you 
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were 
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in 
using language that had been provided by the City.
 14. I added the word "reasonable".
 15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
 16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the 
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2% 
over prime language.
 17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs 
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I 
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and 
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
 18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the 
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have 
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know 
that before we execute the Contract.
 19. I have added the word "reasonable".
 20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should 
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.  
 21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to 
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing 
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
 22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our 
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows 
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the 
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we 
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that 
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should 
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to 
the terms and provisions of the Contract.  

 I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you 
care to discuss any of these matters.

 <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

Dan:

First, I've attached the proposed resolution which authorizes the City
Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior management has
reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to present additional
changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to raise questions
about certain of its terms and conditions.

Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the end of the
exhibits.

1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio agreement which
should be deleted.

2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain the words "1st of
January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties have signed the
contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the date it signs the
contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City to proffer the
to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer) wants Enron
(Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction, as defined.
Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be changed to "shall."

4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:   Buyer's Requested
Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to Schedule the
Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's Deficiency Default.
How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a Seller's
Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does not include a
Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason for the omission?

5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers to "reasonable
attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."  To be internally
consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement showing the
determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.  It's unclear
whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the determination
before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City should be entitled to
receive a copy of the determination and to question it before it is
obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify, or permit the
City to exercise these rights.

7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will exist if a
bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this (under
bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one may seek
dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11 USC section that
backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5 days."  The City
is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be permitted to fail to
Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by Enron Corp.
(ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in this regard?
Please explain.

10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer to "the Company"
?

11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force majeure provision
as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if a FM event
(earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from performing with the
60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation under California
law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last sentence?  We
don't understand it.

13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is referred to?

14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees.

 15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means generally accepted
accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to Company, and
governmental generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied,
with respect to Customer."

16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two percent over".  The
City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes the 2% over prime
should not apply to it.

17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron believe the
City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is mentioned.  Also,
what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade rating?

18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed that the
opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and warranties are being
deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is nevertheless included
in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the City has not
undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice whenever we issue an
opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ... Party."

19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add "reasonable" before
"attorneys' fees."

20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the extent it has a
legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a matter of legal
policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.  Is Enron
amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less costly in my
opinion.

22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the Agreement to include
a list of employees for Company and Customer who are authorized to trade on
behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to this section to
this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an Exhibit C.

Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are others which I
hope to receive from staff next week and which I will forward to you for
response.

Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of town after today
until Wednesday, March 7.

Sincerely,

Grant Kolling

  document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's
office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on

  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's

executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

I need some further clarification.  As I understand it, some, if not all, of 
the meters that reside in Beaumont and South Texas Divisions are included in 
Exhibit C.  Are we saying that the "extend and blend" transaction excluded 
some volume previously included?  That is inconsistent with the analysis 
performed when the renegotiated transactions were analyzed and booked. 

I have asked Arhur Andersen for a copy of the amended Exhibit C so I can 
fully understand.  Maybe that will help clear my confusion also.

Subject: Exhibit C Delivery Points


Ami,

As discussed earlier, the issue is whether all of the Delivery Points 
appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, as amended, are subject to the 
audit of General Service Customers, or whether the audit should narrow the 
focus to the Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions.  Stated 
differently, the issue is whether quantities of gas required by General 
Service Customers in the Beaumont Division or the South Texas Division should 
be considered part of the Basket.

Transaction No. 1 - Revision No. 1 under the ENFOLIO Agreement states that 
the DCQ obligations apply  to "Customer's Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast 
Divisions."  Therefore, although this Transaction identifies the Delivery 
Point(s) as those appearing on Exhibit C to the 76 Agreement, the intent was 
to exclude Beaumont and South Texas.  In an earlier conversation today, Dan 
Hyvl confirmed that the foregoing was the appropriate analysis of this 
Transaction.

Based on this call, it would appear that, although Exhibit C to the 76 
Agreement lists multiple Delivery Points, the intent was to limit the 
Delivery Point to the Customer group referenced in the heading of the 
applicable ENFOLIO Agreement.

Dan further stated that the boundary lines were redrawn at some time prior to 
December 29, 1998 (the date of the Restructuring Agreement).  We have not 
seen documentation evidencing these changes.  In addition, it was discovered 
that the "Texas Coast Division" (referenced on Exhibit C, as amended) is 
actually the "Gulf Coast Division."  Dan mentioned that it would be prudent 
for all parties to outline definitive boundaries of divisions for future 
clarification.  Finally, he stated he would meet with you personally to 
discuss these issues with you further.

I hope you find this information useful.  If you have any questions or 
comments, please do not hesitate to call me or Aaron Roffwarg at (713) 
221-1117.

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Attached is a revised EPOS-PQPC Fuel Supply Agreement with changes in Section 
21.1 per our previous correspondence, and also changes in Sections 7.2(b) and 
16.1(a) to mirror changes requested by David Porter in the Glencore-EPOS 
Fuel  Supply Agreement.  

Larry Pardue will have two execution copies of the EPOS-PQPC Fuel Supply 
Agreement and one counterpart execution copy of the Glencore-EPOS Fuel Supply 
Agreement delivered to  Doug Leach for execution.  As we are signing OPIC 
finance agreements this week, we need to have the project documents executed 
right away, so I will appreciate your signing on behalf of EPOS and returning 
them to Larry Pardue.  We will send you the agreements executed on behalf of 
Glencore as soon as they are received.  Please let me know ASAP if there is 
any problem with these documents.

Thanks for your cooperation.

I wanted to update each of you on a number of matters:

1.  On Tuesday of next week we plan to give copies of the Proposed Stock 
Purchase Agreement and Lease (sublease) to the interested bidders.  The first 
data room visits are scheduled to occur on Thursday the seventh.   Chris is 
going to circulate a revised draft of the Stock Purchase Agreement to 
everyone later today and everyone on the Enron team should have their 
comments to me by Friday evening.  

2.  With respect to the lease, in response to David's inquiry regarding 
section 3.06, I think we should leave in all the parts of 3.06.  With respect 
to subpart (v) would it be possible to leave it in but just handle the issue 
of title etc as a rep.  Also, I would like to add a change of control 
provision to the Lease and provide for a parent guarantee from an entity with 
a credit rating acceptable to Enron.  I have yet to receive AnnMarie's 
comments and questions, but I think you should go ahead and generate a new 
draft for distribution Friday and AnnMarie will have the opportunity to 
comment on the revised draft.  I would ask that the revised lease be reviewed 
by Trina Chandler and Ed Osterberg as well.  Gail, please give me a call and 
we can coordinate getting the revised draft lease to the appropriate 
parties.  

3. With respect to the unwind descriptions and the right to use agreement, I 
would appreciate an update and an estimate on when the unwind descriptions 
and a draft of the exclusive Right to Use agreement would be available.

4.  We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead 
and transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo 
the marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex 
contract as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron 
and sell the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be no 
need for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash 
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one 
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are 
checking on them now.)

That is all for now.  I will keep you posted as things develop (and change!).

Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse

the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is

Janet,
 The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which 
the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the 
meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first 
line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.

Okay, I have coped with the traders in your absence.  Now I intend to leave 
for lunch, my appointment and tomorrow's activities.  All that means that it

Subject: LNG TRANSACTION AROUND THE ELBA ISLAND LNG TERMINAL

ERIC:

We had a brief discussion regarding the LNG sales arrangement Enron has 
entered with El Paso Merchant Energy (successor to Sonat Energy Services) 
centered on the firm service capacity that Merchant holds at the Elba Island 
LNG Terminal, which will be reactivated to accept LNG tanker deliveries 
sometime late next year or early in 2002.

Enron signed a binding Letter Agreement (which included a fairly 
comprehensive Term Sheet) with Merchant on October 13, 1999.  A copy of this 
agreement is attached hereto.




It was anticipated that the parties would execute a "Definitive Agreement", 
which would replace the Letter Agreement and contain a number of other terms 
and conditions to be mutually agreed upon.  As a precaution, the Letter 
Agreement did outline a process to bring closure to this matter in case the 
parties could not agree.

The parties did work together for several months on negotiating an "LNG Sale 
and Purchase Agreement", which added a considerable number of important 
provisions and modified a number of terms and conditions contained in the 
Letter Agreement for the benefit of both parties.  However, the Quality 
Letter Agreement, which is an attachment to the Letter Agreement, has become 
a major source of contention for two primary reasons:
despite the fact that the parties did not intend to modify the Quality Letter 
Agreement, it is apparent to Enron, and indeed to Merchant, that this 
agreement does not position the Terminal with the capability of handling LNG 
from any meaningful number of LNG production sources in the world.
Southern LNG, which is a party to the Quality Letter Agreement, has no 
intention of agreeing to meaningfully modify its Terminal, although something 
could be worked out if Enron were to eliminate a considerable portion of its 
flexibility and optionality in its sales arrangement with Merchant, an 
affiliate of Southern LNG.

I am attaching a copy of the LNG Sale and Purchase Agreement, as it was last 
drafted in early July this year.  This draft does represent some considerable 
movement from the Letter Agreement, but we found it to be acceptable with the 
assumption that the quality issue would be favorably resolved.  This copy is 
in the comparewrite format, but I think you will be able to work your way 
through it for your purposes.




When it recently became apparent that w would not be able to close with 
Merchant in terms acceptable to use, we decided we had better move back to 
the Term Sheet intent, even though both parties will realize some 
unattractive returns.  We have now drafted up the "Definitive LNG Sale and 
Purchase Agreement', which we believe captures the full intent of the Letter 
Agreement and Term Sheet.  It is attached below for your review.




Following your review of the pertinent aspects of these last two documents, 
we would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you to discuss how, from a 
pricing point of view, they might be better restructured.


Regards.
Les

Ellen,
 Is this what you are talking about.  If so, I prepared this amendment so 
that we could get out of a bad trading position.  The customer had the right 
to use first of the month pricing on volume swings.  I believe that Lee 
Papayoti did the deal.  Gary Chapman with Union Carbide indicated that the 
deal is done, however, we are waiting on signatures.

Jared,
 The CES GISB was never entered into between CES and FGU.  I have reviewed 
their requested special provisions and they do not make any sense.  Why 
should we pay the 5 days before they pay us if we are each selling to the 
other, the imbalance provisions works the way it is set up in the GISB and 
their language does not.  Theirs attempts to roll defaults and imbalances 
together and those are two separate concepts.  As such I have instructed 
Debra to prepare our standard GISB with our standard special provisions and 
forward same to Michelle and yourself.  If you have any questions please call 
me and we can discuss.

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Could you look at this?  I think we have reviewed it several times before and

Dave,
 Spoke with credit and they are permitting us to go forward without adding 
credit provisions.  In reviewing your email, are both of the existing deals 
being modified for the period Feb  through July.  your chart says half for 
each deal.  I will do a new GTC confirm that terminates the old and rolls the 
old volumes and new pricing for the period FEb 01 through Jan O2.  Please 
give me a call (713) 853-6895.

That's great Dan, the extension is actually only 6 months (Aug 01 - Jan 02).  
Also, can we make it an "ammendment" to the existing deal?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

At the request of Alan Kilpatrick I am forwarding to your for your
review and comment a proposed letter agreement relating to the sale of
regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in
McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the
terms of such sale.  The latter has been modified from the version you
last reviewed to add certain additional provisions we felt necessary and
to flesh out the unique force majeure provisions that we felt should
apply to this transaction.

Grant/Dan, both Gulf and BP agree with the language. Dan please insert the
clause in both contracts: Transaction #1 and #1a and then please forward
updated contracts.

Dan - does Enron need to sign the assignment again or acknowledge that the
existing assignment agreement will suffice? Either acknowledge by replying
to this e-mail or e-mail to state Enron need to sign the agreement again.

Kelvin - I believe the attachment below will be the final version for BP. I
would attach this document with BP's "package" to be sent to your US
signing authority.

I understand this is the last hurdle in making the assignment work, so lets
endeavor to have all the agreements signed by Tuesday afternoon so we can
start flowing AOS on Wednesday for Thursday's nomination cycle.

Thanks everyone,

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these

I am unaware of any physical trading constraints relating to doing business

financial trading for a coop.

Stacy,
 I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
obtain before granting credit to this company?

Thanks

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

It is my understanding that cashouts coming from Unify look like regular 
sales and purchases.  The accounts used are as follows:

TYPE                                                                ACCOUNT

Cashout Sale - Third Party                             483
Cashout Sale - Intercompany                       484
Cashout Purchase - Third Party                   803
Cashout Purchase - Intercompany              803?

This is how the FERC module in SAP is mapping them.

Rita/Kris - let me know if my understanding of Unify is correct.

See Tom's message regarding cashouts.  Please reply directly to him and copy 
me so I will know how to list these transactions on the tariffs and whether 
the revenue is applicable for TRRC Gross Receipts Tax.  Thanks!

I guess the transport tariff is as good a place to refer to cashouts as 
anywhere.  How should they be listed on the tariffs?  And what (NARUC) 
account are cashouts booked under?

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.  (When did this get assigned to 
HPL?)

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance. DAN

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff. DAN

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing. DAN

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.  DAN
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen AS SOON AS POSSIBLE so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Not long ago and far away, Santa was getting 
?ready for his annual trip...but there were 
?problems everywhere. 

?Four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves 
?did not produce the toys as fast as the regular 
?ones so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure 
?of being behind schedule. 

?Then Mrs. Claus told Santa that her mom was coming 
?to visit. This stressed Santa even more. 

?When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that 
?three of them were about to give birth and two had 
?jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where. 
?More Stress. 

?Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the 
?boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground 
?and scattered the toys. 

?Totally frustrated, Santa went into the house for 
?a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey. When he went 
?to the cupboard, he found the elves had hit the 
?liquor and there was nothing to drink. 

?In his frustration, he dropped the coffee pot 
?and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all 
over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom 
?and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made 
?from. 

?Just then the door bell rang and Santa cussed 
?on his way to the door. He opened the door and 
?there was a little angel with a great big 
?Christmas tree. The angel said: "Where would you 
?like to put this tree fat man?" 

And that my friend, is how the little angel came 
?to be on top of the Christmas tree

Here is the first shot at a time table for Phase II from MLV 812 to Lomax.
The same time table from Phase I was used.  2 days between the phases was
allowed & 1 day for a pipeline repair.  This time table seems to be early
but we need to notify our customers of the dates of this maintenance as soon
as possible.  They need to find alternate sources of gas or plan maintenance
around these dates.  Please review & notify me of any discrepancies that you
find.

We have now been informed by the accounting gurus that  we can go ahead and 
transfer the Entex contract to the purchaser of HPL and not have to undo the 
marked to market position.  As a result, we will transfer the Entex contract 
as well as the other contracts which cannot be in HPL to a new Enron and sell 
the stock in the new sub along with the HPL stock.  There will be no need 
for  a back to back contract.  However, we will need to unwind the cash 
monetization transactions involving the Entex contract, as well as the one 
involving the Union Carbide contract. (there may be others and we are 
checking on them now.)

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be

look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

Texas City Facility -
 The relationship between HPL and Calpine has become and continues to be 
strained.  Calpine purchased the Texas City Cogeneration Facility from Enron 
and Dominion Resources in early 1998.  Prior to that time ENA supplied 45,000 
MMBtu of gas under a fixed price contract and a Market Price agreement was in 
place to provide any additional volumes that might be needed in addition to 
that which Union Carbide Corporation had the contractual right to supply 
under the historic arrangement, since they were the steam host for the 
facility.  After Calpine took over, these contracts either expired or were 
terminated.  At this point HPL became the sole supplier to the facility 
although the interconnection with the Union Carbide delivery point with the 
Calpine facility remained active and a new Transaction Agreement was put in 
place whereby Calpine agreed to certain minimum and maximum quantity 
obligations and agreed on the prices that would be paid for any short fall in 
volumes.  Since then, measurement disputes have been alleged and Calpine has 
shortpaid HPL's invoices even after verbally agreeing that the amounts 
invoiced were correct.  Additionally, as a result of Calpine's power 
purchaser's last minute notification to Calpine of reductions in the purchase 
of power for the next day, which notification is usually after Calpine's next 
day notification deadline to HPL, Calpine has resorted to the use of  
creative force majeure situations in an effort to reduce their costs.  These 
notifications have occurred some thirteen (I think) times and Calpine has 
provided little explanation to HPL of the nature of these events of force 
majeure.  When pressed for a more detailed explanation, they merely state 
that they had to take down various unit(s) to repair or replace leaking 
valves, etc.

Clear Lake Facility -
 The relationship between Calpine and HPL is not as strained with regard to 
deliveries at this facility.  This may be because the contract covering the 
base volume of gas being delivered by HPL has not changed since it was 
negotiated by ENA in 1995.  Midcon remains connected to the facility and 
delivers certain quantities of market priced gas.  Market priced gas is 
required by the facility when its requirements exceed the base volumes 
supplied under the 1995 agreement.  Should the power purchase agreement be 
amended to allow Calpine not to deliver powered or should the power purchaser 
cancel the power purchase agreement, Calpine has negotiated an amendment 
allowing for the delivery of the base volumes at alternative delivery 
points.  Currently, HPL has advised Calpine of an upcoming event of force 
majeure which will require a cessation of deliveries of gas to the facility 
which certain regulatory mandated tests are being performed on the A-S 
pipeline.  It is not known whether the Midcon delivery point has the capacity 
to handle the entire facility gas requirements or not.

the words "and Enron confirms the nomination," that was previously in the 
first line of the third paragraph under Other of the Spot Confirmation.  
Please confirm if this deletion is okay.  If not, please let me know and I

Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to 
Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and 
exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the 
future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references

leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system that 
AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other changes.

No, that's OK I suppose.  I just have some concern that at some point St. 
Mary's may say they won't pay.  I'd like to obligate them while they're 
willing.  Any way you see to do that and address your concern?

Teresa,
 I think that the problem is what is meant by "these costs".  Currently we 
think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't 
know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting 
them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may 
be different with regard to next months deal.  Please advise.

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

I guess saving PQP LLC $14 million through the renegotiated fuel supply 
contract is not on the level of your highly complexed project financing 
mindset.

Subject: Re: Amendment to Fuel Supply  

  Thank you for your e-mail with the draft of the amendment to the fuel 
supply agreement.  I disagree that the amendment has nothing to do with the 
1996 letter.  It is correct that the 1996 letter was superseded by the 
amended and restated fuel supply but the situation created by the 1996 letter 
was not contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  The lenders 
were not given a copy of the 1996 letter until recently and naturally asked 
to be in the same position created by the 1996 letter which was not 
contemplated in the amended and restated fuel supply.  Notwithstanding the 
lenders strong case, I am still trying to argue this and many other issues 
and there is a slight possibility we may be able to convince the lenders they 
do not need this document.  

We will continue to do our best to protect Enron's interests (at all levels) 
in this highly complex and difficult financing.  As always, constructive 
criticism and suggestions to improve our work are very much appreciated.

I will keep you informed of further developments

Thank you

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist 
PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally 
superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

Doug:

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested.

Is this to be in replacement of the amendment I previously drafted or in 
addition to the volumes on that amendment?

Dan,

When we originally discussed a physical gas contract with SMUD, I mentioned 
that we had sent them a contract in the past.  That is why I asked if we 
could incorporate some of the language from their long term contract in order 
to appear to be working with them.  Also, I was under the impression that you 
were working with Shari to incorporate applicable language from the 
agreements that we have come to terms with them on.  So, I guess using the 
standard agreement, which is not what I requested, might have been a waste of 
your time.

I understand that their contract language might be lacking and I didn't 
expect to use their contract in full.  ( He indicated that SMUD used language 
from one of Enron's old contracts?).  If you say that we can't use any of 
their language - that's fine too.   It just seems as though you sent a 
standard form without considering my requests.  I also need to be informed of 
the reasons we can't use any of their language so I can discuss this with 
them.  SMUD is one of the customers we have already missed opportunities with 
and if we can appear to work with them - it would be to our benefit.  Legal, 
as well as credit, is considered to be a part of the team that helps build 
these customer relationships.  I hope we can work with them on this agreement.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim,
 What is meant by a "new review of this agreement"?  Have they reviewed the 
master previously?  If so, I have been wasting my time inserting the credit 
requirements into the standard agreement?  
 I have reviewed the contract form that they provided and it is lacking in 
numerous areas.  I think it is a form they put together for use with a 
Canadian producer.  The remedy for a default is determined by the sales or 
purchase price that the other party can negotiate, as such ENA cannot comply 
because we do not allow anyone the ability to review our contracts with other 
parties.  The form also has no credit provisions, no limitation of liability 
provisions, no acceleration provisions in the event of default, etc.  
Additionally, a transaction can only be done by signing a confirm, and if not 
signed, no agreement.  
 Let's discuss where we go from here.

This was the reaction that I just got from SMUD.  I am assuming that we 
didn't incorporate any of their language, which is fine.  It would just be a 
point of discussion if I could point out that we were working with their 
language.

Thanks,

Dan,

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Do you have a problem calling Howard Hertzburg (Coleman's attorney) directly 
to answer his questions regarding the indemnity provisions regarding 
preserving the non-jurisdictional status / FERC / etc.?  This will really 
speed things up.

That is the contract that I stated below isn't in Livelink.  I checked the 
File Room's database & they haven't ever received anything.  Therefore, the 
only thing that would exist would be the confirmation.  The TAGG or CPR Deal 
# is N23222.  With that number, Bob Bowen should be able to pull it for you.

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

The reviewed and redlined version of your contract is attached below.  I

your agreement.  Stacy and I are presently negotiating the Enfolio
agreement and I believe that we are near completion.

I have submitted essentially the same edits to your contract that were
suggested by our Legal/Credit Departments for the Enron Enfolio.  Please
review these changes and call me with any questions or concerns.  Stacy
Dickson was kind enough to offer her assistance as well.

You may reach me at (713)207-3266 with any questions or concerns.  I look

I have reviewed the documents you forwarded to me and have the following 
comments:

1.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Glencore Ltd. and Enron 
Fuels International, Inc. -  
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  "The total cost of 
such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Seller and 
Owner."

2.  Fuel Supply Agreement to be entered into between Enron Fuels 
International, Inc. and Empresa Energetica Corinto Ltd. -
 Page 6 - first line of 7.1 (b) the number of days should be changed from 
"20" to "21".
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.1 should read as follows:  "Any costs of 
testing at the loading port shall be borne by Seller's supplier."
 Page 15 - last sentence of 15.2 should read as follows:  "The total cost of 
such testing at the Unloading Point shall be shared equally by Buyer and 
Seller's supplier."
 Page 21 - Insert the following sentence immediately prior to the last 
sentence of 21.1:  "In the event Seller's Affiliate withdraws from the Buyer 
or the Project, (i) this Agreement shall immediately terminate and (ii) Buyer 
(as purchaser thereunder) shall enter into a direct agreement with Seller's 
supplier (as seller thereunder) on the same terms and conditions as this 
Agreement, except Buyer shall provide such security as requested by Seller's 
supplier."

3.   Indemnification letter agreement - appears to be okay as reflected in 
the redlined draft.  Please prepare on EI letterhead.

4.  Option Agreement - The purpose of this agreement is unclear.  The 
agreements are assignable to affiliates; however, if a new fuel affiliate is 
set up to take EFI out of the supply arrangements, EFI will not continue to 
provide technical, accounting, management and other support without adequate 
compensation, nor is EFI willing to give up its rights to transfer the 
agreements to any other EFI affiliate.  I see no purpose for the Option 
Agreement, please delete.

Kim,
 Please review this draft.  I have not modified any language from the Enfolio 
to that contained in the draft of their form of contract which you forwarded 
to me last week.  I will read their long form and see if it makes sense to 
include their language.  Remember, in their short form, they had language for 
short breaks which was slightly diffent from ours but with a little torture, 
we could have incorporated their language once we got over the hurdle that we 
can't agree to let them audit our contracts,  which means we could never show 
them what we got for the default quantity.

Gary, Is this the Master Agreement under which Janet Wallis sent notice to 
Mercado that notwithstanding the stated Period of Delivery thereunder, all 
existing Transaction Agreements would expire effective September 30, 1998?  
If so, which Transaction Agreements do you wish to redo for the period May 1, 
1999 thru April 30, 2000.

 Please get with the Peoples attorney regarding the use of the attached Spot

Dan, 
Per my earlier conversation here are the details.

The original contracts are 078-27105-302 (NGMS & Entex) and 058-27105-301 
(HPLC Mktg & Entex) .  The NGMS contract in Section 8 allows 1 year to 
recover volume changes and the HPLC Mktg contract in Section 8 allows 2 years 
to recover volume changes.  Per our conversation today, the contract 
provisions override the state law and Entex should not be invoiced the 
additional volumes.

Janet, since we cannot rebill Entex do you still want us to reallocate and 
then write off the dollar amounts.
This would enable us to be in sync from a physical volume side.   Please let 
me know.

Subject: Re: Entex 1997  

Howard, I believe the contract reads that we have up to 2 years to re-invoice 
so could you explain the 4 year Statute of Limitations.  I am not familiar 
with it and if we do have a legal right that overrides the contract then we 
should explore this option.

Also,  what is the standard operation procedure?  Are we reconciling the 
entire system and re-invoicing everyone whether it is for or against the 
pipeline?

Janet

Subject: Entex 1997

Janet,
Here is short note to update you on the questions you had on 1997.

This came about due to a project that Volume Management is working on for 
Brenda Herrod in reconciling the 1996-1998 Unaccounted For.

In comparing the measurement volumes at the various meters that make up the 
aggregate meter 2000, it was discovered that some of the measurement volumes 
had changed.  The Entex analysis  has been done for 1998 and had one 
adjustment for June 1998 of 14,660 additional invoiced to Entex.  The 1997 
analysis was done within the last month and this is when the discrepancies 
were found.  I have done a preliminary analysis for 1996 and the only 
material volume appears to be in April 1996 of 8,296 additional volume 
needing to be invoiced to Entex.  The 1996 will be completed by Mid March. 

I sent Ami the 1997 analysis to ask her how she wanted to address the issue 
of whether or not you wanted to go back to Entex.    

The Statute of Limitations is 4 years, so both the 1996 and 1997 adjustments 
would fall within this timeframe.

Please contact me if there are any other questions or issues.
HC

Jason --

Attached are the documents with the changes incorporated.  As we discussed on
Friday, the plant maintenance will run into November.  Since we sold gas to 
the plant
at the maximum level through October 20th, a smaller resale volume or MW 
Turndown
will have to be used for the first week or so in November.  Also, I have 
tried to adjust
the formula so that you get the same answer as what your memo with the 
examples
indicate.  If there are a few more changes, please let me know.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday.

Ruth

Dan, I would suggest the following language to replace rather than deleting 
Enron's accepting the nomination.


... and Enron receives the notification of the nomination at least 30 minutes 
prior to the 1st GISB nomination cycle deadline, ...

I will call you to discuss further.

Dan,
I need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with Intercontinental 
Terminals Company.
This company is located at 1943 Battleground Road, P.O. Box 698, Deer Park 
Texas 77536-0698.
My contact is Lynn Bingham (281) 884-0312. They have showed interest in doing 
a  fixed rate. That 
is why I would like for them to sign a Master contract at this time. That way 
when we agree on a price
we can act on it without having to wait on getting them approved. They passed 
along to me that they
are a sister company of Global Octane. Call me with any questions.

Dan,  All your changes looked good, thanks.  I incorporated all of them into 
the document.  The purpose of the liquidated damages section is to compensate 
ENA if JEA decides to go with someone else during the term of the option (as 
you anticipated).  Because the language in the proposal didn't comunicate 
that, I have added a few sentences.  The purpose is to treat a JEA breach as 
an "Early Termination" as detailed in our Enfolio Agreement.  Please review 
the addition and let me know what you think.

Thanks, - Mike

Dan, Could you please review the attached proposal to Jacksonville Electric 
Authority.  Enron is buying (for $0) the right to put a long term gas supply 
deal to JEA.  JEA has verbally agreed to the concept.  If they are fine with 
these commercial terms the next step will be to turn in into an executable 
contract.

Thanks for your assistance, - Mike

Susan,
 I have reviewed the contract form that you provided in November and have 
attempted to make the changes which would be required for Enron to utilize 
the form.  I believe that the red line document attached  should address a 
majority of the issues which  need to be changed.  Please review and give me 
you comments as to the suggested changes.

Barbara, 
 I am not sure whether my response was sent or not yesterday.  My Notes Mail 
crashed every time I tried to send an email.  The reason that I suggested 
that Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado remain with their affiliated 
distribution utility is that transactions with these entities are usually 
behind the city gate, transactions usually bounce between the utility and the 
marketing entity until a decision is made by the counterparty.  In the past 
we have documented transactions as being with the marketing entity and Entex 
has requested that they be with the utility, also the reverse has occurred.  
However, if the utility will set up different marketing reps to keep the 
business straight, then we should be okay with moving the marketing to HPL.

Gary,

There are three changes:

1)  When you converted the former CONTRACT PRICE #3 to a MinDQ cash out 
clause, the idea of cashing out the DCQ was lost.  I copied the clause from a 
previous version and added a debit or credit sentence.

2)  I put in a point 4 under Contract Price to capture the idea that if 
Westvaco was going to have a Shutdown during the month, we could call you and 
you could get out of you position with the advanced warning, therefore we 
could avoid the cashout.

3)  Finally at the end of the Contract Price section, I put language to 
incorporate the idea that fixed pricing would be included in the DCQ.

Please call and we can discuss.

Thanks,
Michael

Dan,

ENA and FGU currently operate under an interruptible agreement inherited 
through the CES purchase.  FGU has interest in getting a GISB in place with 
the attached provisions.  Could you please review and let me know you 
comments.  I would like to complete this process quickly.

Jared,
As we discussed earlier today, FGU is interested in purchasing firm supply at 
a fixed price for summer and/or winter.  Currently, Enron and FGU only have 
an interruptible contract in place for supply purchases.  In order to get a 
firm contract in place in a short amount of time, I think we should execute a 
GISB contract if Enron is acceptable to that.  I have attached two word 
documents to be implemented into the GISB contract.  One is FGU's general 
information and the other is our special provisions.  Please have your 
contract department implement the attached information into a GISB contract 
and have it sent to me for review and execution.  If your contract department 
has any questions, please have them call me at 352-334-0776.
Thank you!
Michelle

Subject: Henry Ford and God




Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford and
tells him, "Well, you've been such a good guy, and your
invention...the assembly line for the automobile...changed the world. As a
reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want."

Ford thinks about it, and says, - "I want to hang out with God Himself."

So the befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him
to God. Ford then asks God, - "When you invented Woman, what were you
thinking?"

God asks, "What do you mean?"
"Well," says Ford, "You have some major design flaws in your invention:
1. There's too much front end protrusion.
2. It chatters way too much at high speeds.
3. Maintenance is extremely high.
4. It constantly needs repainting and refinishing.
5. Every 28 days it leaks fluid and is rendered out of service.
6. The rear end wobbles too much.
7. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust.
8. The headlights are usually too small.
9. Fuel consumption is outrageous.

"Hummmm," replies God, "hold on a minute." God goes over to the
Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the
results. In no time the computer prints out a report, and God reads it.
God then turns to Ford, and says, "It may be that my invention is
flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding my
invention than yours.

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

Dan,
Attached is the break down of what was ironed out with Alagasco. Tammi 
DePaolis reviewed the deals (and the CES original information) and several of 
the deals will be editted thus negating any volume constraints. Two of the 
deals were negotiated with the CP under the assumption and agreement that the 
transactions were to be covered by the 'new' 9/1/99 ENA Enfolio. Tammi is 
going to contact Roger Putman and we should then have this letter in hand. 
HOWEVER, we need to confirm with accounting that we have collected all 
relative demand fees according to the CES contracts. I will check with Mary 
Ellenberger (since she has always been the person rendering us the most help) 
on how we can confirm such has been collected.

Mary,
On the attached spreadsheet is a collumn that shows the Demand Fees 
associated with each contract. Do you have a way, or know of a person with 
whom we can get these amounts confirmed? The amounts are rather high 
(escalated 5% in some cases since 1991). Could mean some big dollars for ENA.

Thanks all!!
Cyndie

 The subject contact that you faxed to me appears to be their standard 
interruptible 311 contract.  t is a month to month interruptible contract.  I 
see no reason why it should not be signed.   Please call me if you need 
anything further.  I will be in the AEP Houston Metro building office 
starting on Monday.

If ENA has a contract with Dynegy that the East Desk is using currently, then 
that contract will not be going with HPL.  If ENA is currently doing business 
with Dynegy in Texas, then the Texs Desk of ENA should be using the same 
contract as the East Desk of ENA is using.

Just for my own knowledge ... does Texas need to negotiate contracts or do we 
have contracts that cover all activity no matter what region.  For example, 
if Dynegy currently does business with our East desk, does Texas need a 
separate contract or do we use the same contract?

Linda,
 It is my understanding that all of the existing contracts for business done 
in Texas that somehow touches the HPL system will go with HPL or its 
marketing entity.  This will mean that ENA will have to negotiate a contract 
with each of those parties whose exiasting contracts will go with the HPL 
sale to AEP.

Dan,

Has this all been taken care of through the assignments from HPL to ENA?  

Please let me know if there is anything that Global Contracts needs to do.

Thanks,
Linda

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's

Leslie,
 I have reviewed the product descriptions for the natural gas products on 
Dynegydirect and they appear to be standard descriptions which should be 
easily understood by our traders.  As such, I am comfortable with such 
descriptions.

Dan,

An EFO is a result of parties not complying with an OFO after multiple 
notices.  PG&E can confiscate gas if a scheduling party is not in 
compliance.  The same rules apply to an EFO as an OFO.  EFO stands for 
Emergency flow order.

Thanks,

Kim

Grant, 
 I have removed the red-line from the above document.  If it is in order, 
please print 2 originals, have them signed, and forward to me for signature 
by Enron.  I will attach a list of current traders who might be available to 
handle a trade with Palo Alto, and I will also have  a certificate of 
incumbency attached for the officer signing in behalf of Enron, and return a 
fully executed contract for your files.
 Regarding the OFO language, usually the pipeline notifies its customers of 
the OFO event and leave it to those customers to notify their parties.  
Therefore, if Enron is scheduling gas into your transport contract and your 
transporter declares an OFO, you will get notice and be responsible for 
giving that notice to Enron after which time Enron would be responsible for 
its actions that were not in accord with the OFO notification.  Likewise, if 
Enron receives notification from its transporter and notified Palo Alto and 
Palo Alto failed to adjust its actions in compliance with the OFO 
notification, Palo Alto would be responsible for the consequences of such 
failure.  Usually, the OFO notification would require that the parties make 
their receipts and deliveries balance in accordance with their scheduled 
volumes.    I am not familiar with the concept of EFO, but do not think that  
the OFO provisions apply.  Please advise as to what is meant by EFO so that I 
can verify with the transport group.

Veronica,
 The credit language is only one of many areas of disagreement between the 
consultants view of what the contract should look like and our version.  
Their last response was that the MAC would be triggered if Enron Corp. fell 
below an A rating.  I informed them that we could not agree because it was my 
understanding that Enron Corp. was currently rated as BBB.  I will let you 
know if you need to be involved in the contract negotiation or 
non-negotiation in the future.  I do not currently have a response from the 
consultant as to our last position on her nonagreement to make the necessary 
changes so that we could agree to document the 3month deal.

Dan,

I've looked through the contract (at least the credit terms).  Of course I 
prefer to keep our credit language w/ the mac language of ratings decline.  I 
am not too familiar w/ the transaction itself.  I simply feel that if it 
truly is just a 3 month transaction, we may not need to 1) argue this much 
further and add special language to a confirm 2) issue out a $10MM gty (or if 
we do make it valid for only the three month term as it ties to the contract 
itself)

Please let me know what you think.  The marketer and the counterparty contact 
on the deal have been calling me for a response.

Veronica

Veronica,

Attached is a redline version of the entire contract with Wisconsin Public
Service.  It includes all the changes requested by Dan Hyvl.  It has been
edited with my counter (i.e. - striking what not acceptable/relevant and
providing underlined substitute).

One thing I'd like you to consider in your review is the term and scope of
this contract.  The contract is for 12/00 - 2/01, 3 months, only.
Furthermore, the contract language covers just this transaction - it is NOT
the base document for future transactions.  I will begin work with Enron
early next year on a Master Contract to cover all future transactions.

With that in mind, I'd like to suggest that we remove any reference to a
Material Adverse Change.  It is currently a new and unsettling concept to
WPS, particularly their Credit Dept.  Given that (1) the contract is short
duration and (2) it is extremely unlikely that WPS will fall even to a BBB
ratings within this time period, I feel removal of this language would
greatly improve the chances of getting a meaningful contract in place
quickly (note today is the effective date).  I will work with WPS on this
concept for the future Master Contract.

I am leaving for lunch but will be back shortly.

Thanks for your help with this.

 Can you please have someone get me a copy of the Valero deal that expired

		 Subject: Marathon, Formosa & Valero Sales Contracts

Dan, here is what I have found regarding the contracts we discussed yesterday:

I don't know what Marathon entity Gary Lamphier is trying to extend the term 
under, but I found the following:

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Ashland Petroleum, LLC that expired 
9/30/00 (Contract# 96023515).  It was for Deal# 119068 at meter 1431.  The 
confirmation is in Livelink.

The last GTC-Sale Firm with Marathon Oil Company expired 9/30/98.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

There is a GTC-Sale Firm with Valero Marketing & Supply Co. which expired 
10/31/00 (Contract# 96023503).  It was for deal #116542.  There isn't 
anything in Livelink regarding this contract/deal (which probably means that 
the File Room doesn't have anything either).
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----

As for Formosa, there is a Master Purchase Sale Firm (Contract# 96000517) 
with Formosa Hydrocarbons Company, Inc. which had a primary term of 8/1/95 
thru 7/31/96 & is still on evergreen.  The confirmation is in Livelink.

There is also a Master Purchase Sale Interruptible (Contract# 96000522) with 
the same counterparty which had a primary term of 12/1/94 thru 12/31/94 & is 
still on evergreen.  There isn't anything in Livelink except the generic 
assignment from HPLR to HPLC (which probably means that there isn't anything 
else in the File Room).

There aren't any GTC's of any type in Global Contracts with Formosa.
______________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________

I can print copies for you of the Marathon GTC & the Valero Master (Firm) 
from Livelink.

Please let me know what you want me to do.

Please prepare and send up to me

There is one revision to the volumes, they are  11,740  and 8260     rather

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

Attached is a draft transaction agreement for October 2000, the assumed 
maintenance
month during the MW Turndown time period.   The boiler-plate language is 
identical to
the document sent to you earlier.  The only changes are to the DCQ, Delivery 
Points, and
Contract Price language for Part I.  These changes incorporate Sithe's 
concerns that 
the month of October should be divided in two parts, one when the full plant 
is available
and the other when the only one block is available.  For invoicing purposes, 
it has been
assumed the GSA sales reduction tied to one block being down for 15 days 
would keep
ENA whole for what the GSA sales volumes would have been if there had not 
been a MW
Turndown transaction.  We have not yet verified if this is an accurate 
assumption, so some
additional adjustments to the volumes/time period may still be required.

Stacey,  please find attached the completed marked up GTC that we need to 
finalize and re-submit to Crestar.

TO DO:    I have added a line in part 3 ( blue).  Add this section .  Either 
add in other terms that section 2 and 5 are not applicable for just delete 
them.. my preference is to just exclude them in the other terms piece rather 
than delete completely.


This will complete the monthy volumes confirm for Crestar. Make these changes 
and send back to me today. 

Thanks.

OTHER:  Please e-mail to me the latest version of the AOS balancing confirm 
and I will add changes that we went through. 

Call me if you have any questions but we are almost there... 

PS.  we must get this done now because as of Nov. 6 Crestar loses some of 
their staff and I don't want to start over on this process with new people.

Subject: SALES OF LNG - Force Majeure

Nancy:

As we move forward with sales opportunities for our vaporized LNG at Elba, 
the issue of force majeure protection will surface.  On the one hand, we want 
to present  ourselves as a credible and reliable supplier of natural gas to 
any US customers.  I believe these customers will be looking for force 
majeure language that is standard in the industry, which should include force 
majeure on the pipelines transporting the gas to their facilities, on the 
production facilities, to the extent they are dedicated or are affected by 
some large event (such as a hurricane or a major storm) in the region, and on 
the LNG terminalling and storage facilities at Elba.   
They will not, however, be looking for a non-standard force majeure clause 
that deals with possible situations in foreign lands and waters, i.e. as 
described, more or less, in our force majeure langauge in the El Paso 
Merchant Energy agreement.  If we try to include that kind of protection, the 
customer will see the supply as risky and uncertain, therefore less valuable, 
in the first instance.  

Our LNG strategy is focused on establishing a merchant activity, which 
requires both supply and market aggregation.  Such an activity will give us 
protection against individual force majeure events by its very nature (i.e. 
through diversification).  The basic question, then, is when do we start 
acting as if we are an bonafide LNG merchant?

We can mitigate for the need to build in unique force majeure safeguards in 
several ways:
lower relative price
alternative, albeit interruptible, sources of natural gas supply
alternative fuels
selection of customers with alternative fuels or replacement production.
business interruption insurance
selling the gas to El Paso instead of directly to a customer.

However, I believe this issue also needs to be addressed in the context of 
our probable need to "lock-in" our pricing through the use of financial 
instruments.  What's more, our customer may elect to do the same, quite 
independent of us.  As I understand it, there is very limited force majeure 
protection available to either of us in this regard.

I know you are working on the force majeure provisions of the draft 
Definitive Agreement with El Paso, so I believe it is opportune at the 
present time to extend this assessment to address the issues set forth above 
(and others?).

When can we discuss?

Regards.
Les

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Kim,
 I am reviewing the changes you made to see if they conform to our 
discussion.  I understand from your comments in the email that you disagree 
with the items we discussed and are attempting to go back to the previous 
language which I indicated would be unacceptable.  As such, I have gone back 
over the redlined contract and have only commented on the things that differ 
from our previous agreement.  Please review these and call me in the morning 
if you feel that your client cannot agree to these changes.  
1. The sentence added at the end of 9.1 should be deleted.  Any differences 
between the DCQ and actual is to be handled between the party and its 
transporter.  As I explained, if we schedule a DCQ of 10,000 with you and the 
pipeline and only deliver 9,500 to the pipeline, the pipeline will deliver 
10,000 to you and collect the 500 shortfall from us.  Likewise, if we 
schedule 10,000 with you and the pipeline and you only take 9,500, we still 
sell you the 10,000 and the 500 you didn't take is between you and your 
pipeline transporter.
2. 10.3 and 10.4 need to be deleted.  What we agree to say was as follows:
  "10.3  Buyer represents that no taxes are applicable at the Point of Sale.  
In the event such representation is false, then such misrepresentation shall 
be a Triggering Event allowing Seller to terminate the Contract pursuant to 
Section 17.1."
3. Delete the language "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" that 
you added in the 2nd and 8th lines of 12.3.  
4. Delete the language added at the end of 12.5 and add language after the 
word "expired" at the end of the second sentence.  "In no event shall any 
event of force majeure extend for a period in excess of 10 days during the 
term of this Contract.  After such 10 day period, the parties shall be 
obligated to resume performance as if the event of force majeure had been 
remedied, and if such party does not resume performance, such nonperformance 
shall be deemed a Triggering Event allowing the other party to terminate 
pursuant to Section 17.1."
5. Delete item (vii) added in 17.2 because it is adequately covered by my 
inserted language in 12.5.
6. The $15,000,000 changed in the 3rd line of 17.4 needs to be changed back 
to $10,000,000.  If the exposure exceeds $10,000,000, that is the reason 
additional security would be required.  This contract contemplates that 
Seller has to provide security for any exposure in excess of $0 whereas the 
Buyer only has to provide security for exposure in excess of $10,000,000.  
Not a very balanced obligation because the Seller is bearing all risk of 
payment after it makes deliveries under the contract.

Dan,

Attached is a redline document which compares our current version to your
11/22 version.  I have summarized our differences below, but I will call you
at about 10:30, subject to your calendar, to discuss the items.

Significant Differences
(1) Taxes
 I deleted Enron reference to Buyer paying taxes AT the Point of Sale.  I
(a) kept our 10.3 but added sentence that "no taxes currently applicable at
POS and (b) added Sec 10.4, which we discussed gives either Party right to
terminate contract if they are assessed an unduly burdensome tax.

(2) Exceptions to Force Majeure
 I added "not otherwise due to an event of force majeure" to the section
addressing failure of reserves/insufficient production from reserves.  This
should clarify that if a force majeure event, ie explosion, occurred at
Seller's supply point, Seller would NOT be obligated to perform (except as
identified in Triggering Events).

(3) Billing
 We cannot accept Enron's requested changes.  It is the industry-standard to
bill Buyer's based on what WAS, not what was TO BE, delivered.  If actuals
are not available, it is acceptable to bill based on DCQ, but once actuals
are available, prior period adjustments would be made to the next invoice.
 To demand a procedure different than the accepted industry-standard is
something that should have been stipulated by Enron at the time the Contract
Terms were established in 8/00.
 Given the tremendous progress we've made to this point, I am hopeful that
Enron will accept the industry-standard (billing on actuals) for this
contract.  We can address this issue next month when we begin preparation of
the future Enron/WPS Master Contract.

(4) Credit Terms
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed Enron's Material Adverse Change
definition, (b) removed Enron's Sec 17.2(vii) regarded MAC and (c) added
back our Section 16.10 Credit Terms, whereby either Party has the right to
demand credit support if in their sole and non-discriminatory assessment the
other Party might not be able to meet its financial obligations pursuant to
the Contract.  Failure to provide credit support is considered a Triggering
Event per Enron's language.

(5) Effect of Force Majeure
 Based on our 12/6 discussion, I (a) removed language referring to
consequences of extended force majeure but revised to refer to Sec 17.2
Triggering Events and (b) added Sec 17.2 (vii) to make extended FM a
Triggering Event.

(6) Collateral Requirement
 THIS IS A NEW REQUEST.  I would like to change the Termination Payment
threshold from $10MM to $15MM.  In light of soaring gas prices, WPS could
find itself owing more than $10MM strictly based on standard,
full-performance Accounts Receivable (for example:  15,000 (MDQ) * $10 (gas
price) * 60 (days) = $9MM.)  I believe your provision was intended to keep
Buyer's from having multi-month A/R and/or non-performance charges.
 Since I believe we agree WPS is fully capable of meeting its financial
obligations, we should not set a threshold below potential standard,
full-performance A/R.


MINOR ITEMS
(1) Throughout document, I made changes to your comments to make consistent
with form of entire document, including changing Daily Contract Quantity to
DCQ and putting days in words (ie 20 days became twenty (20) days).
(2) Deleted Nominated Quantity definition as this term was replaced by DCQ.
(3) Other changes that we agreed to yesterday.

Dan, please let me know the earliest, convenient time for you to discuss
these items with me on the phone.

Thanks for your help.

Kim

Cathie,
Here is a suggested form of mortgage subordination.
Let me know if the form is OK with Ed.
By copy hereof I'm asking Dan Hyvl of Enron to review document as to form
and
requesting that Dan also let me know if the form is satisfactory.

When I get the OK from both Ed and Dan as to "form", I will complete the
agreement and
walk it over to Ed Alexander at BancFirst for execution.

Dan,
This a.m., BancFirst (the Enernet mortgage holder referenced below) has
agreed to execute a
subordination agreement in favor of Enron.  This can be completed quickly.
I will forward
the executed subordination agreement to you asap.

Now that the BancFirst mortgage is no longer an issue, we need to get all
agreements signed.
Once I get the subordination to you, when can we get final agreement drafts
to review?

A review of the county records should have taken about 1/2 of a day.  What's
status of this review
of the county records?

Doug

Bob--

First, the air permits finally went to public comment on Feb. 14th (we have
received actual copies from the DEQ confirming this); with any luck, we'll
have air permits issued by the 3rd week of March.

In order to proceed with our deal, Enron would like to request that Enernet
work out a deal with their current mortgage holder wherein Enron would not
be subordinate to the current lender.  Although I've copied Doug on this
e-mail, I hope to speak with him verbally to find out if this can be
completed quickly.  I realize that you need to be constructing your
gathering system, so we all need to get this deal finalized.   I assure you
that I am pushing Houston from my end.  In this regard, I do not know yet
if any additional info will be required from Quantum.  I told Houston that
I need to know by tomorrow.

Please pass on to Paul the air permit info.

Thanks.

Dan

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .

It wasn't too bad.  The phone company sent out a repairman Saturday morning 
and that is how I found out about all of the flooding because we had less 
than normal water accumulation from the rain Friday night.  Lots of sunshine 
Saturday afternoon and most of the day Sunday.  I spent some time shopping at 
Sam's Saturday and Haley and I cleaned my back room of the garage Sunday 
afternoon.  I notice that the bikini car wash is still operating.  They were 
out Friday afternoon when I went home about 5:30 just a few minutes before it 
started raining at the house, of course it rained hard on me most of the way 
home till I got about a mile from the house.  I also noticed them out 
yesterday, however, I think they may have aged.  Are you sure that James 
doesn't have an opening for them.  They seem to be hard workers, at least 
they go through the motions.

 In response to your voice mail, yes the change from Enron Capital & Trade

General Service Customers - Houston, East Texas and Gulf Coast Divisions 
dated effective as of April 1, 1999 between ECTR and Entex, a division of 
Noram Energy Corp. is 96019120.

 The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for 
Large Commercial and Industrial Consumers dated effective as of May 1, 1995 
between ECTR (assignee of HPL Resources Company) and Entex, a division of

 The Global Contract No. for the ENFOLIO Master Purchase/Sale Agreement dated 
effective as of May 1, 1995 between ECTR (assignee of HPL Resources Company)

No, there is some overlap.  Of the 80 contracts listed on my 11/19/2000 
transmittal, 5 of the purchase contracts and 13 of the sales contracts were 
also listed among the 88 Schedule 4.13 (v) Material Contracts originally 
transmitted to Patrick Wade on 10/26/2000.  Thus, of the 80 ENA contracts 
provided for Dan Hyvl's review, only 18 were significant enough to be 
included on the Material Contracts list.  Sixty-two of the contracts were not 
significant enough to be included on the Material Contracts list and may, 
after further review, not need to be included in the Purchase and Sale 
Agreement for one of many reasons:  they may be spot gtcs that can easily be 
replicated in the name of HPLC if necessary, although active in our global 
contracts system they may not be currently used regularly, or, we may already 
have acceptable contracts in the name of HPLC to handle this business.

Dan,

Based on the 11/6/2000 Enron North America Corp. Deal Listing for all deals 
with flow dates between 4/1/2000 and 11/30/2000 for the three (3) HPLC Desks 
(ENA - IM Texas, HPLC - IM HPLC and HPLC - IM Wellhead), we have determined 
that there are 80 contracts which are currently held by Enron North America 
Corp. which should be reviewed for inclusion in the proposed Triple Lutz 
transaction.  Those contracts are listed on the attachment.

Candy,
 My initial reaction to the letter is that we should not commit to do a 
contract for deed for the buyer.  The buyer needs to obtain financing from 
another source and take us out completely; otherwise why are we doing it.  
Another buyer may come along during the interim.  Let's discuss this with Ann 
Elizabeth next week.

I have drafted and attached a basic offer to an adjacent land owner for a
property sale.  He and I have negotiated this for some time and this is
basically my final offer.

Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of
the changes you would require before this is sent out.

 Please review to verify that I have included all of your changes.  I believe 
that the language in the first 3 cover us if the last agmt isn't done, 
otherwise, the last one covers the trueup of negative values.  Do you 
concur?  Please let me know if these are okay, and I will get my secretary to 
deliver to you originals on ENA stationary.

The IRS has announced that the standard mileage rate for use of a personal  
automobile for business will be 34 1/2 cents per mile starting January 1, 
2001.  Enron's policy is to follow IRS guidelines, so use this rate for all 
mileage incurred on or after that date.

Could one of you please call Amy Baird to talk to resolve Items #3 and #4 in 
her memo.  They have agreed to our changes on #1&#2.  Mike Cesario at Ormet 
told me to drop #5.  They did agree to limit total consequential damages to 
$1,000,000 for the contract.  They would like for the language in 8.3 to 
limit their damages to actual replacement costs (transport, hedges, 
re-marketing the gas)  since we can't really incur consequential damages.  

Thanks

Hey Russell (as well as Dan and Debra),

Pursuant to our conversation of this morning, I just want to confirm the 
following.

1.   We have agreed that we will use separate guarantees (for the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada, L.P. ("Engage Canada")) with respect to each of 
Enron Canada Corp. ("ECC") and Enron North America Corp. ("ENA").  This will 
allow for the appropriate guarantees to reference the peculiarities of each 
of Canadian and American law (as applicable) as well as deal with the 
potential "permanent establishment" tax issues we discussed.   As a result, 
Dan does not need to review the draft guarantee I sent to him on Wednesday.

2.  You are going to send me a revised credit sheet for the ECC-Engage Canada 
master physical agreement which removes references to the obligations of 
Engage Canada to ENA (likely requiring a guarantee of Westcoast Gas Inc. (on 
behalf of Engage Canada) to ECC in the amount of US$15million (the "New ECC 
Guarantee").

3.  Dan is to coordinate negotiating/obtaining a new guarantee from Westcoast 
Gas Inc. (on behalf of Engage Canada) to ENA in the amount of US$5 million 
(pursuant to the master physical agreement between Engage Canada and ENA).

4.  I am still not sure what we are doing with respect to the "Enron Corp." 
guarantee which was provided to Engage Canada and Engage Energy US, L.P. 
("Engage US") in the amount of US$35million (which guarantees the obligations 
of ENA, EPMI and ECC) (the "Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee").   According to 
the credit sheet last provided to me, Enron Corp. is to provide a guarantee 
in the amount of US$25million but you were going to check to see if we were 
leaving the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee in place.  

If we are replacing/amending the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee, we need to 
coordinate with counsel from all three of ENA, EPMI and ECC to ensure that we 
are properly revoking the Existing Enron Corp. Guarantee or amending it 
appropriately.  Ultimately, I would prefer that the Existing Enron Guarantee 
be amended to remove the references to ECC such that we can arrange for a 
separate Enron Corp guarantee on behalf of ECC.  This would allow for greater 
flexibility/efficiency in the event that the industry or trading relationship 
between ECC and Engage Canada develops and future amendments are required.  

Please let me know how you would like me to proceed with respect to point 4.

Thanks,

Mark Powell

Subject: Re: Engage Energy Canada L.P. Guarantee  

Mark,

The guaranty you are providing to Engage Energy Canada should cover both ECC 
and ENA although should only reference the Master Firm Contract between ECC 
and Engage Canada.  Dan has been working on a separate guaranty that will 
reference the Master Contract between ENA and Engage US that is currently 
being drafted.  The reason ENA is included on the guaranty for Engage Canada 
is because of business done at Dawn in Eastern Canada through ENA.  

If you and Dan want to issue one guaranty to Engage US and Engage Canada 
referencing both contracts I think that would be a good idea, the guaranty 
amount should be between $45MM and $50MM and include several Enron entities:  
ENA, HPL, EPMI (referencing the Master Energy agreement), Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc and ECC.

Let's discuss further in the morning as to how about resolving this.

Thanks
Russell

Subject: Engage Energy Canada L.P. Guarantee

In furtherance of the message which I left for you, please find attached a 
copy of a replacement guarantee for your review.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of 
guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the 
project, the 
 US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to 
guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US 
L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the "Existing Guarantee"), is to be 
replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy 
entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).  

As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with 
revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which 
Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron 
Canada Corp. (the "ECC Physical Master") as well as the master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North 
America Corp. (the "ENA Physical Master").   Russell had allocated US$15 
million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and 
US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.

Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an 
"Amended and Restated" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of 
significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee 
(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have 
prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas 
Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to 
ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking 
for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement 
guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the 
Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to 
Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which 
I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master 
and the appropriate contact information for notices).

When you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined 
replacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the 
Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.

Thanks for your help.

Mark Powell ((403) 974-6708)



Note to Russell:  Russell, you were going to confirm for me that the existing 
Enron Corp. guarantee delivered to Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage 
Energy US L.P. to secure the obligations of Enron Canada Corp., Enron North 
America Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (in the amount of $35 million) 
dated June 1, 1998 is NOT to be replaced.  Has there been any progress on 
this front?

Dan, further to my voice mail. Please find following changes as required to 
close off documents.

Document # 1:  c:\temp\2000-87crfm.doc

Change document as follows:

3)  In the event that the Customer does not deliver the Designated Quantity, 
Company will purchase "Replacement Gas". "Replacement Gas Quantity" shall be 
the difference between the Designated Quantity less the actual volume 
delivered to the Company by the Customer multiplied by the "Replacement Gas 
Price".   "Replacement Gas Price" means the Midpoint price published on each 
calendar day that the replacement gas is purchased under the heading "Daily 
Price Survey" in the Citygates - Chicago LDCs, e-users section of Gas Daily , 
or if a calendar day is not a business day then the Replacement Gas Price for 
such calendar day will be the Daily Midpoint price published on the next 
succeeding business day.  In the event that the Replacement Gas Price exceeds 
the Contract Price, Customer will pay company the difference. If Replacement 
Gas is less than the Contract Price then Company shall pay customer the 
difference.  

4) In the event that the Company fails to take the Designated Quantity then 
Customer shall use all reasonable commercial efforts to sell such volume and 
Company shall pay the customer the Contract Price plus any reasonable 
expenses that the Customer incurred to sell this gas.

Dan,

Here is the latest Westport contract with a few changes I need you to take a 
look at.
Also, in Section 8, what are payment securities? They would like this to be 
defined.
They also would like Section 9 to be bi-lateral.

One other question Westport has is - If the delivery point (screw compressor 
meter) is off the acreage lease, can all the fees be charged back to the 
royalty owners?
I told them you may not want to give an opinion on this and they are alright 
with that.

Let me know your thoughts on all the above.

Mike

Hi Dan,

I just got a call on a contract you routed to me at my old location.  About 
three weeks ago, my group moved to the 21st floor.  Please send all 
purchase/sale agreements to me at EB2127B and any processing/service

earlier.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

At Craig's request, I am forwarding the final revsion to the Ormet Firm 
Purchase/Sale agreement.  The last change is additional language in Section 
4.3 and is the result of discussions between Enron and Ormet credit.  The new 
language is in blue.

Please get back to me with any comments as quickly as possible so that Enron 
can move forward with Koch Gateway.

Ina, Craig asked that you forward a copy to Jay in credit so that he can 
review the new language as well.

Thanks to you both,
Mike

Dan,

Here is a redlined version from Westport.
I have not looked at it yet, except I see they want to call this 
Transportation service.
I'm sure this is a problem we will have to address.

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks
Ellen

THE BLONDE KIDNAPPER

A blonde was down on her luck. In order to raise some money, she decided to 
kidnap a kid and hold him for ransom. She went to the playground, grabbed a 
kid, took him behind a tree, and told him, "I've kidnapped you." She then 
wrote a note saying, "I've kidnapped your kid. Tomorrow morning, put $10,000 
in a paper bag and put it under the pecan tree next to the slide on the north 
side of the playground. Signed, a blonde." The blonde then pinned the note to 
the kid's shirt and sent him home to show it to his parents.

The next morning the blonde checked, and sure enough, a paper bag was sitting 
beneath the pecan tree. The blonde opened the bag and found the $10,000 with 
a note that said, "How could you do this to a fellow blonde?"

I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several 
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since 
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please 
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for 
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we 
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be 
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's 
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?

Dan, I don't want to be a pest, but as I hope you have been made aware, this 
deal is suppose to be completed by quarter end, which means Friday.  I 
understand fire drills and putting out the hottest flames, but I am thinking 
this one is getting pretty warm because we need to start reviewing any 
documents in order to have them finalized for signature and booking no later 
than Friday afternoon.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to 
help facilitate at least a first draft by this morning.

Thanks,

Steve

Clement,

As a follow up to Veronica's e-mal to you a few days ago regarding the review 
of this guaranty, can you please let me know the status of your review.  
Please make note, the redline version attached below (enronredline112900.doc) 
was originally drafted by Dan and yourself as an attachment to an Enfolio 
Master agreement.  We are anxious to exchange guaranty's to cover exposure in 
this volatile price market.

Thank you,
Russell

Clement,

Attached below are Coastal's (formerly Engage Energy US) comments to our 
outgoing gty format.  The ISDA was recently amended due to Guarantor changes 
on their end, so now gty's are also being negotiated.  Please review their 
comments and forward either me or Russell your comments to forward on to 
Coastal.

Thanks again Clement,

Veronica

As  discussed, I am forwarding my recent email to Russell Diamond on the

?Russell,
?
Please find attached  a revised redline Guaranty which incorporates changes 
to Enron's standard  format.? In addition, we request??the following 
important  changes:
?
(1)???The proposed Guaranty?shouldcover all Obligations and not be  Contract 
specific.? Therefore the language in the second paragraph  beginning with the 
word 'WHEREAS' needs to be suitably amended by your Attorney  to reflect that 
all Obligations??of the  Obligors?are covered and?the 
Guaranty??obligations?are not tied to specific  contracts.
?
(2)? Under  Section 2, titled 'MAXIMUM LIMIT',?the Maximum Limit?should notbe 
capped for each entity at a  specific amount.Conversely, the limit on  
the?Guaranty?shouldbe a  'Unified Maximum'.??Please request your attorney to 
make suitable  language changes for this change as well.
?
Please send me a  revised redline earliest convenient for our review.

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61and would it be appropriate for 
HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being sent to Upstream.  
The documentation that has been provided to me shows that this amount relates 
to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 payments were made 
pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a nomination of 500 a 
day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the wells, has made a 
reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties that Upstream 
represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information provided does not 
indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the reallocation, HPL 
or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that has now been 
allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its responsibility 
for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect the money from 
the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly written 
correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete because it 
did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and volumes.  That 
contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the confirmation 
evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes should have been 
sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did not have a copy 
of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was the same under the 
Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated that since HPL's 
agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue should be resolved 
through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61 from the next payment to be made to Upstream and hold such sum 
in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL needs to be aware that in the 
event it is not able to prevail on its claim for such sum, it will need to 
remit such amount together with interest to Upstream.

Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP 
who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties, 
Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount 
that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at 
5-3595.  Thanks for your help.

Walter

Travis,
 Peter Keohane was the attorney who was working with PG&E to put a contract 
in place similar to what ENA agreed to.  I have not seen any amendments 
proposed by PG&E, did they get omitted from my email?  I am attaching the 
proposed amendment which I had forwarded to PG&E last year to enable them to 
trade on Enron Online.  
Please let me know if you need anything further.

PG&E made a proposal to John Lavorato and Bill Bradford today to secure some 
additional gas supplies from ENA and Enron Canada.  I am faxing a copy of the 
presentation and relevant documents to each of you.  I think that this is a 
deal that we are interested in looking at.

John and Jim, I think the only question we will have for you immediately are 
the bankruptcy implications associated with the advance payments.  PG&E 
claims there are none (of course).

Dan, since you reviewed the original PG&E (Core) Master Agreement, can you 
review the proposed amendments to that Master?    

Mark -- I don't think Enron Canada is a party to the PGE Master.  Can you 
take a look at the form ENA executed and see if there is any reason why Enron 
Canada couldn't execute the same form?

Note that PG&E also wants to be re-established to trade on EnronOnline.  I 
understand the only impediment to that is that the masters need to be amended 
to provide that Enron, not PG&E, is the confirming party, and that we were on 
our way to documenting those amendments when this all blew up a few months 
ago.  Dan, can you resurrect those amendments so we can see if we can weave 
them into these amendments?

Dan,

Here are Sithe's changes to the documents.  Since the plant was down for 
maintenance until last week, the November agreements will not be executed.  
Please refer to the clean documents.  Also, we need to prepare a separate 
group of documents for first quarter of 2001.  Then we can incorporate your 
language for the end of the quarter true-up payment.

Attached are the 2 draft agreements, each in black-lined as well as clean

cleaned up the true-up for December peak, making a reference into the 
December off-peak document.? Please make sure that you think it works.

is being requested from our lawyers, Vinson & Elkins, so that they may 
release their opinion in connection with the closing.  They must have the 
Certificate in order to do so.

Thanks Dan, and please call me at 202 628 1700, or my cell 713 854 8000, or

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q: I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A: Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Have you seen the fully-executed copy of the subject Agreement with Enron 
North America Corp.?
 It is not listed in the Tracking List.   I was faxed an unexecuted copy by 
Reliant.   I understand Reliant
now has received a fully-executed copy, but we do not have this contract set 
up in Global.    

Will  you track this down with Legal and route it to me for briefing, as I am 
handling all Reliant and
Entex related contracts.

Thank you

 All of the sales to Reliant Energy Entex and/or Entex Gas Marketing Company 
should be made by Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  Please identify the 
two deals that you have under HPL so that we can get them documented under 
the proper ECT agreement.

Dan,

 Why is it that all sells to Reliant Energy - Entex are billed under ECT & 
not HPLC?  I have two spot deals billed to Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC.  
Should these two deals been billed under ECT or is it ok to have a billing to 
Entex Gas Marketing under HPLC?  Could you let me know.

Thanks,
Kyle

Water and Electric Board.  Please have a look and let me know how you think 
the actual confirm should look.  They have an Enfolio in legal review now.

 Please see Brian Redmond note to Brenda below regarding meeting with MidCon 
to talk about their imbalances with Reliant Energy.  This could possible open 
both parties up to a torturous interference argument with Reliant Energy.  Do 
you agree?  If so, we need to nix meeting idea.

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Linda,
 I am looking for the follow-up assignment.  I remember having it prepared 
and signed when the AEP people were looking at the contracts across the 
street.  The reason it was assigned back to ENA was that it needed to reside 
in ENA through July 1999.  Thereafter it could be assigned to HPL.  If I 
don't find the copy, everything got scuffled in the move, I will reassign 
effective as of August 1, 1999.  Is this acceptable?

Dan,

This contract was assigned to HPLC effective 5/1/00 and reassigned to ENA on 
the same date.  The reassignment included a note from you dated 5/23/00 
stating  "the Union Carbide contract has been assigned in error and is 
reassigned to ENA because that contract was included in one of the prior ECT 
monetizations".  This contract is included on the Exhibit A of the assignment 
back to ENA.

 Is there another assignment reassigning the contract back to HPLC from ENA?

Please adivse.

An issue has come to light regarding this contract.  HPL has received an 
amendment to contract 96002201 between HPL and Union wherein it refers to an 
assignment between EING and HPL.   Our clerk, Cathy Harris, spoke to Dan Hyvl 
concerning the Enron entity name discrepancy and obtained a copy of the 
assignment effective 5/1/00 which includes Union Carbide as a contract to be 
assigned.  The contract was evidently not assigned on the 5/1/00 date.  
Please have someone in your group make this correction and let me know when 
the correction is completed so that we can process the amendment timely.

As I made Alan Aronowitz's changes yesterday, I also generated a
non-Enfolio form of Gas Contract in case we need it.  A clean version of
this is attached, as well as a copy marked against the second draft of the
Oil Contract distributed last night.  There are three kinds of changes: (1)
additional recitals to make it clear that this is an output contract, not a
firm contract, (2) modifications to reflect the fact that the gas will be
sold on a daily basis, and (3) various additional provisions from the old
Cactus gas contract.

Perhaps this will be helpful.

  This draft has not been sent due to pending guaranty issues.  The attached

( per your change) and are specific to this agreement.  Dan has advised the 
guaranties are written for the agreement and we cannot change to include 
other Enron Companies.  You will need to contact  Enron Corp. for a guaranty

Dan -

I accept the terms of the confidentiality agreement, so please feel free to 
execute so that we can see the Ormet financials.

With respect to the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, I realize that we 
have yet to determine the final collateral threshold amount (hence the need 
for Ormet's financials).  However, I would like to point out that Paragraph 
4.3 has a typo with respect to the Customer's threshold.  The figure should 
be "$1,500,000" but currently reads "1,5000,000" (with an extra zero).  Just 
in case we should settle on a $1.5 MM threshold, we need to ensure that this 
is corrected.


Thanks,

Jay Williams

Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.

Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Dan,

Per our conversation on Friday regarding HPL, please coordinate with Clement 
to issue a new guaranty.  As you recall, Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation 
has $50MM of exposure from HPL and they have requested additional security 
above the amount in the current guaranty listing HPL (gty2846.doc).  Please 
issue a new guaranty for HPL covering Aquila Energy Marketing Corporation for 
physical natural gas in the amount of $50MM.  In addition, please put 
language in this guaranty which would amend the existing guaranty 
(gty2846.doc) that would remove HPL. 

Thank you,

Russell

Jeff,
 I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the 
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.  
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete 
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken 
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the 
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did 
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use 
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of 
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future 
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that 
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of 
default.  
 If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to 
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his 
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.

darren,
 This was done as a signed GTC transaction.  I do not know if they have 
signed or not.  The paperwork provides a zero collateral threshold.  The 
counterparty is a limited partnership.  J. E. Robert Companies is the general 
partner.  The enron counterparty is Houston Pipe Line Company.  I see no 
reason to redo the paperwork if the original GTC has been signed.  Do you 
agree?

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Dan,
I need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement in place with Intercontinental 
Terminals Company.
This company is located at 1943 Battleground Road, P.O. Box 698, Deer Park 
Texas 77536-0698.
My contact is Lynn Bingham (281) 884-0312. They have showed interest in doing 
a  fixed rate. That 
is why I would like for them to sign a Master contract at this time. That way 
when we agree on a price
we can act on it without having to wait on getting them approved. They passed 
along to me that they
are a sister company of Global Octane. Call me with any questions.

Dan, I will be sending you my comments on the
Subordination Agreement shortly, but wanted to ask one
question in the meantime--is the legal description set forth in
the Subordination Agreement the correct legal description for
the property--I wanted to give further information to the title
company in undertaking their search of the records.  Let me
know.  Thanks.

Gary,  
 Please review the foregoing to see if it is your understanding of the deal.  
We have no documentation from Shell Chemical Company to evidence their 
assignment of the contract to Shell Chemical L.P., so I have left the 
Transaction under Shell Chemical Company.  I assume that you are have Steve 
Van Hooser work on the Lease Amendment.  Call me if you need anything 
further.

This letter and agreement were required to be executed as a condition 
precedent to closing due to the failure to have the consent at the time of 
closing.....it cost us at least $500,000; this should not have occurred.  
Dan, please have a draft of the agreement which comports with this 
agreement....and not the back-to-back previously drafted  ready for my review 
by Friday.  I will circulate it to AEP, on Monday or Tuesday.....if you have 
questions, see me.

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

Michael,
 
 Gary asked me to review your requested changes and provide revised documents 
for your review and, if acceptable, execution. Attached please find 
2001-012bcrfm which is the extension document, 2001-012abbcrfm which is the 
clean copy of the long term document modified as discussed in 1,2 and 3 
below, and 2001-012abbrcrfm with is the red-line of the changes which have 
been incorporated in the clean version of the long term document.

 1.  I have left the reference in 3) to MinDQ, because the DCQ should always 
be less than the MinDQ and as such, any short fall in required purchases less 
than the MinDQ (which includes the DCQ) will be bought back by the Company.   
I have added a sentence at the end to provide that Customer will be credited 
for the Buyback Volume which Company purchases from Customer.  By way of 
examples,  (A) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that 
Customer's total natural gas requirements for such day was 20,000; and 
Customer's actual purchases from Company for such day was 12,000.  In that 
event the MinDQ would be 20,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from 
Company at the price in 1); Customer would purchase 5,000 from Company at the 
price in 2); and Company would purchase 8,000 from Customer at the price in 
3).  (B) assume that the DCQ for a day was set at 15,000; that Customer's 
total natural gas requirements for such day was 12,000; and Customer's actual 
purchases from the Company for such day was 12,000.  In that event the MinDQ 
would be 15,000 and Customer would purchase 15,000 from Company at the price 
in 1) and Company would purchase 3,000 from Customer at the price in 3).

 2. I have added your requested paragraph 4) to provide that should 
Customer's total natural gas requirements be below the DCQ and the parties 
are able to agree on a reduced DCQ below Customer's total natural gas 
requirements, then no buyback would be applicable.

 3. I have revised the last sentence of the Fixed Price Strategies as you 
requested.

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Paul:

The reviewed and redlined version of your contract is attached below.  I
spoke with Stacy Dickson/Enron North America this a.m. prior to reviewing
your agreement.  Stacy and I are presently negotiating the Enfolio
agreement and I believe that we are near completion.

I have submitted essentially the same edits to your contract that were
suggested by our Legal/Credit Departments for the Enron Enfolio.  Please
review these changes and call me with any questions or concerns.  Stacy
Dickson was kind enough to offer her assistance as well.

You may reach me at (713)207-3266 with any questions or concerns.  I look
forward to hearing from you.

Dan,
I understand that Jeff Hodge has forwarded the terms of the storage exchanges 
to you for confirmation. There may be a couple of item to clarify within the 
terms. First, under the "late notification" section please change the forst 
sentence to read: Late nominations available by 3:30 pm on the nomination day 
prior to gas flow. Also, change the last sentence under 'Payment Terms" to 
read: Oneok will pay each month $72,916.67 to enovate by the 25th day of the 
month following the service month.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Dan and Greg,

Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.

Thanks--

Veronica

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have

Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another 
contract under HPLC and assign that one.
What do you think?  I understood that the purchaser of HPl was to get all 
Texas deals and since this was in ENA for regulatory reasons, just like 
Entex, it would be assigned to the new marketing entity that was being set 
up.  Has something changed so that these utility accounts are not going to 
the purchaser of HPL business?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River 
Sation) to refect a swap from index to fixed price.  Can someone send me the 
original deal so that I can see what needs to be amended?

$6.28 + .199 instead of Index + .199

Dan-

This attachment reflects the initial comments by Coleman's Attorney back in 
September.  Due to the substantial revisions, we did not pursue utilizing any 
of their changes, but instead asked them specify their primary points of 
contention.  Although it took four months, I believe the fax refers to our 
request.

Let's discuss.

Thanks.

 Attached are the following documents:

 (1) re-draft of Gas Purchase Agreement with comments in bold,

 (2) re-draft of Gas Purchase Agreement without comments in bold
(i.e., the same as item (1), but without the bold),

 (3) black-lined copy of the Gas Purchase Agreement showing the
revisions made to Enron's initial draft relative to the re-redraft
without comments in bold (i.e., Enron's initial draft as compared to
item (2)),

 (4) re-draft of the Gathering Services Agreement, with comments
in bold,

 (5) re-draft of Gathering Services Agreement without comments in
bold (i.e., the same as item (4), but without the bold), and

 (6) black-lined copy of the Gathering Services Agreement showing
the revisions made to Enron's initial draft relative to the re-redraft
without comments in bold (i.e., Enron's initial draft as compared to
item (5)).

 With respect to the Gathering Services Agreement noted in item
(4), it incorporates revisions made subsequent to the draft that I
e-mailed to you on September 13.  For the most part the revisions are
too minor to be worthy of flagging to you.  The more substantive
revisions are as follows: (A) Section 5.1 was revised to match Section
9.1 of the Gas Purchase Agreement, (B) in Exhibit A, the Fort Union
In-Service Date was revised to reflect the fact that it has already
occurred, (C) in Exhibit A, Section L.1(i)., the reference to third
party, and the related text, was deleted; and (D) in Exhibit A, Sections
M.2, N.9, and N.10 were added.

 With further regard to the Gathering Services Agreement, please
let me know if you want to use the measurement provisions that I
e-mailed to you on September 13, or just use the provisions included in
Enron's draft of the Agreement.

 As I mentioned to you, these agreements still require some work,
but they should at least advance the process and give you something to
discuss with Enron next week.

 As I also mentioned to you, due to fairly extensive rearranging
of the provisions of the agreements, the black-lined versions may not be
easy to follow.

A young Marine and his commanding officer board a train headed through the
mountains of Switzerland. They can find no place to sit except for two
seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother.

After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young soldier
are interested in each other because they are giving each other "looks."

Soon, the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a
sound of the smack of a kiss, followed by the sound of the smack of a
slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without
saying a word.

The grandmother is thinking to herself: "It was very brash for that young
soldier to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."

The commanding officer is setting there thinking: "I didn't know the young
Marine was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't
missed him when she slapped and hit me!"

The young woman was sitting and thinking: "I'm glad the soldier kissed me,
but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"

The young Marine sat there with a satisfied smile on his face, thinking to
himself: "Life is good. When does a fellow have the chance to kiss a
beautiful girl and slap his commanding officer, all at the same time?"

Re; 0:/Legal?DHYVL/DJH/2001/Ltr/2001-005crfm.doc
I just did a deal with Panther and I would use the same contract with this 
additional language.

Period of Delivery: April 01, 2001 - March 31, 2002


add that either party can terminate with 30 days written notice
add evergreen language so the deal will roll after the one year term.


Thanks,
J


Is the commodity price at Katy tail gate or HSC?  It looks like the contract 
says both?

Importance: High

Dear Mr. Bruce and Mr. Hyvl:

In response to Mr. Bruce's telephone call of this morning, attached for your
consideration is a draft resolution, which the City proposes to substitute
for the opinion of counsel letter in connection with the Enfolio contract
with Enron North America Corp.  As I have mentioned to both of you, the City
Attorney is not inclined to execute the opinion of counsel letter as
proposed.  The City does not issue such opinions whenever it has negotiated
energy contracts in the past.  Whenever the City Attorney has issued
opinions of counsel in connection with revenue bond issues, those opinions
of counsel have been quite limited in scope.

I had asked my legal assistant to fax this document before I spoke to Robert
Bruce this morning, but this e-mail may arrive before the fax.

Please note that the City's staff has not reviewed or commented on this
draft resolution, so there may well be changes.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

s/

Grant Kolling
Senior Asst. City Attorney

The attached document was prepared by Dan Hyvl for Francisco to give to the 
lenders for their comments and/or approval. The1996 side letter in question 
was not a part of the recent renegotiated fuel supply contract and should not 
have been an issue with the lenders in the first place.

Attached is the revised amendment quickly redrafted in  an attempt to assist 
PQPC.  The amendment has nothing to do with the 1996 letter which was totally 
superseded by the new fuel supply arrangements.  It is strictly an 
accommodation to PQPC without the benefit of any consideration to EPOS.

contract with PQP LLC and we are in the process of trying to sell the asset 
and transfer the fuel contract to the new buyer and Glencore?

Subject: Amendment to Fuel Supply

Doug:

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a 
call, otherwise please let me know you are okay with it so that I can send it 
to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

Attached is the Second Revised Draft of the bullet point procedures and an 
updated
schedule of the volumes that will be transacted for during the October 
outage.  The changes
to this schedule and the additional shift of volumes from ANR-OK to ANR-LA 
can now be
calculated based on the October posted fuel rates.  I have added the language 
that
Larry and I discussed for the weekly report of incremental revenues.  Also, I 
felt it was
necessary to Bullet Point #5 under the GSA nomination section to clarify that 
a sales of 
any extra gas to a third party is not allowed.

Daily Purchase Quantity, the Transportation Capacity Credit, and the 
Transportation Capacity Release, as well as a few minor clean ups for 
consistency.  Please provide any additional comments needed and may I ask one 
more time to make sure the Transportation Capacity Credit is worded properly.

Thanks for your help and making time for me this morning.  I am also sending 
this to Chicago in order for Peoples to have their legal review it also.  I 
am also going to visit with credit, but if you know of anything credit wise 
that should be in here, please let me know.

Thanks,

Lavonne and I  visited with Mom Sunday afternoon.  We cooked outside and had 
a great time.  Mom said that she might want to fix noodle soup on Mothers 
Day.  That would be great.  We can supplement with sausage or hamburgers on 
the grill.  What do you think.  Mom's memory appears to be good about many 
things, and then some things just don't seem to register.  She seemed 
confused about whether Bettye had been their for Easter.  Is this normal, 
what type of medication is the doctor having her take to combat the loss of 
memory?  Maybe we can all get together Mothers Day and visit.  Email me back 
please.

Dan,

Attached is a redlined letter agreement with Southern Co. that I have made 
changes based on our discussion with them late Friday.  Les is going to help 
with some of the language.  Make sure to incorporate the new language on 
"Binding Commitment to Enter Into Confirmation Letter" I sent to you last 
Thursday or Friday.  I will send it again just to be sure.  As soon as he is 
ready, lets sitdown and discuss the agreement.  We have been able to raise 
Southern Co.'s price from Hub + $.15 to Hub + $.20 or $.21 with the 
possibility of up to Hub + $.25.  We will know more on price on Tuesday but 
lets keep blank for the time being.  I will be back in town on Tuesday.  Talk 
to you soon.

Thanks.

Janet,
 Two items regarding the Panther deal.   What is meant by "Greenhouse 
requirements"?  New delivery point, can be get a better description about 
this point, is it currently in existence, if so, how was it put in, who was 
the deal maker for the installation, etc.  After this information is 
provided, I see no reason why this shouldn't be documented by the confirm 
desk using a standard    GTC confirm.

  Really Bad Day

  There was this little guy sitting inside a bar, just looking at his
  drink. He didn't move for a half an hour.

  Then, this big trouble-making truck driver stepped up right next to him,
  took the drink from the guy, and just drank it all down.

  The poor man started crying.

  The truck driver said, "Come on man, I was just joking. Here, I'll buy
  you another drink. I just can't stand to see a man crying."

  "No, it's not that." the man said. "Today is the worst day of my life.
  First, I overslept and was late for an important meeting. My boss became
  outraged and then fired me.

  "When I left the building to go to my car, I found that it was stolen.
  The police said they could do nothing. I then got a cab to return home,
  and after I paid the cab driver and the cab had gone, I found that I left
  my wallet in the cab.

  "I got home only to find my wife was in bed with the gardener. I left
  home depressed and came to this bar. And now, when I was thinking about
  putting an end to my life...

  "... YOU show up and drink the poison."

I'm forwarding these comments to the Mortgage Agreement from Quantum for your 
review.  I'm not very familiar with Mortgage/credit - type issues, but let's 
discuss our responses at your convenience.

Thx

Subject: Bonepile:  WHGGS Mortgage 



Dan,
Per our discussion this am.

Mortage concerns:
 B. Recitals:  we want to make clear that the term loan amount can be
"up to" $750,000 as opposed to "is" $750,000.

 1.1:   Mortgagors need to be defined as all working interest owners
in the leases and not the royalty or overriding
 royalty owners.  Also stipulate that ownership of the Wellhead Gas
Gathering System (WHGGS) ownership is
 identical to the leasehold working interest ownership.  Here again
Quantum will need to sign on behalf of itself and as
 agent for its program investors.  EOW will sign for itself.  The
nonworking interest owners will also need to sign for
 themselves.

 1.2.b:  Again stipulate that RI and ORRI owners not subject to
mortgage or that all leasehold working interest owners
 are bound.

 2.1:  Mortgagee would be the assignee in this provision.   We need
clarification on the ramifications of the assignment
 being absolute.

 2.4:  No duty of Mortgagee to produce rents is too much control to
give Mortgagee even in theory.

 3.1:  Stipulate that lien affects only leasehold working interest
owners.

 5.5.1:  Again mortgagor needs to be well defined.

 5.1.(b):  Enernet of Wyoming (EOW) has granted a mortgage to secure
the operations bond required by the Wyoming
 Office of State Lands and Investments in the amount of $10,000.
This mortgage is a permitted exception hereto.
 EOW has also file of record AAPL Model Form 610RS-1989 Recording
Supplement to the JOA and Financing Statement
 in the ordinary course of business.

 5.4:  The loss threshhold should probably need to be increased in
light of the funding amount involved.

 7.3:  The personal liability language referenced in this provision
appears inconsistent with the in rem nature of the
 mortage and therefore out of place.


Dan, let me know when we can talk with you and/or your counsel on these
matters.

Thanks,
Doug

Barry,
 Item 2 of the attached document states that Section 8 does not apply to this 
confirmation.  Why can't we change the language to state that Sections 2, 5 
and 8 do not apply to this confirmation.  I would prefer to do this in lieu 
of changing the standard GTC terms and conditions.  Otherwise, what is meant 
by the language "if the replacement price is not representative of the market 
price, the parties may agree to use a fixed price in lieu of the index price"?

Thanks, Dan.  I've scanned and they look good to me, but I'll pass on to my
client for the final say-so.  I believe we can get this done fairly soon.
Grant.

Agreement


  Grant,
       Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional
inquiries.
       7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to
read:  "(b) file a
  petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in
the commencement
  of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law
of the
  protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against
it and such
  proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a
petition is filed
  against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is
actively pursuing all
  steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the
other party with
  reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause
such proceeding to
  be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an
additional 30 Days to
  effectuate such dismissal,"
       8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days"
is acceptable.
       13.  I will change the definition of "Act" as you
suggest.
       21.  I propose that language be added whereby the
parties shall first
  attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of
binding
  Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not
resolve the issue
  to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall
thereafter be
  resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an
acceptable
  resolution?
       22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are
authorized to
  enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is
that whoever
  answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized
to bind the
  company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial
contact list of
  the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as
of the date
  the contract is signed; however, the persons who are
authorized to enter
  into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the
initial contact
  list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact
someone on the
  initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be
acceptable?

  Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                     Dan.

Purchase/Sale Agreement






  Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was
out of town
  again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work
within 3 days.

  Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow
up with a couple
  of additional inquiries.

  7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated
in sentence 2.
  Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be
agreeable.

  8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

  13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11,
sections 5 and
  9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.
Section 3 is not
  regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my
knowledge,
  though
  I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

  21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not
recognized, if
  I
  have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in
which I've
  participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical
matter, it can
  cost
  almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed
to mediation,
  but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found
in arbitration.
  We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should
consider this
  approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would
not recommend to
  my client that we would proceed any further once the
mediator makes a
  proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of
arbitration is not
  worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer
mediation to
  arbitration.

  22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we
assemble some list.
  Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be
initially approved
  to
  engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.
We've had an
  unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
  energy company regarding the scope of its representative's
authority.  We
  don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That
list would help
  It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back
out of the
  contract, because someone arguably didn't have the
authority.  There are a
  ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make
that claim.

  Thanks.  Grant.

  >>
            (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

            Grant,
                 I have reviewed your requested changes and
have made
  the changes which
            do not require explanation or clarification.
Those changes
  are reflected
            in the above document.  Let me go over your list
of items:
                 1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
                 2.   I have left a blank for the date within
the month
  of March 2001
            when the contract would be executed by the City.
                 3.   I have changed the word "may" to
"shall".
                 4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
does not fit
  in a
            Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum
quantity that can
  be handled by
            a party at a particular point.  I do not think
their is an
  omission.
                 5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
                 6.   The procedue for how the Termination
Payment is
  determined is
            provided, if the City disagrees with the method
and values
  provided in the
            statement and is unable to convince the Company to
revise,
  the statement,
            then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.
At the
  point that a
            Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a
long drawn
  out period
            should not be necessary to attain closure.
                 7.   We need to limit the duration to 30
days,  neither
  party should
            be required to wait 60 days before it could
accelerate the
  other party's
            obligations under the Contract.  We might be able
to add
  language to extend
            the period if we had some documentation stating
the steps
  that a party was
            pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed
and the
  other party was
            otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
                 8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days
is too
  short a period.
            During a holiday period, one scheduling error
could cover
  the entire
            period.  Article 3 has language which provides a
remedy for
  a party if a
            scheduling default extends for more than 5 days
during any
  month.
                 9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the
rated
  entity and no
            separate rating applies to ENA.
                 10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
                 11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation
on the
  duration of an
            event of Force Majeure.
                 12.  This merely addressed the possibility of
a
  imbalance amount being
            due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using
multiple
  points, and the
            language would allocated the payment based on the
amount of
  the imbalance
            that a particular party may have caused.  I think
the
  language is clear as
            written.
                 13.  The definition of Act was one of the
items that I
  had requested
            that you review and complete as necessary so that
all
  appropriate statutes
            were referenced.  I am still waiting for your
language.  I
  started filling
            it in using language that had been provided by the
City.
                 14.  I added the word "reasonable".
                 15.  I have made the requested change
relating to
  GAAAP.
                 16.  This is a late payment provision and as
such a
  believe that the
            provision should be more than a party's rating, as
such I
  have kept the 2%
            over prime language.
                 17.  These amounts were determined by the
credit group
  and any change
            needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is
considered
  investment
            grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating
is BBB.
  ENA is not a
            rated entity and that is why the language relates
to Enron
  Corp.'s rating.
                 18.  The elimination of the opinion of
counsel did not
  change the
            requirements relating to the representations that
we expect
  the City to
            have made.  If the City cannot make these
representations,
  then we need to
            know that before we execute the Contract.
                 19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
                 20.  The party that has the Transport
Agreement with
  the Transporter
            should have the legal right to obtain the
information based
  on its
            contract.
                 21.  It is our position that any dispute be
arbitrated.
  We can agree
            to meditation if we can make the outcome binding
on the
  parties.  I am
            willing to discuss any changed language that you
might care
  to offer.
                 22.  We have found that personnel of both our
Company
  and that of our
            Customers change so rapidily that the list is not
workable
  and merely
            allows a party to back out of transactions it does
not like
  on the basis
            that the person who agreed to such transaction was
not on
  the list.
            Therefore , we object to any listing of approved
parties who
  can transact.
            We believe that each party should be responsible
for the
  actions of its
            employees and should stand behind any transactions
that
  those parties may
            enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of
the
  Contract.

                 I will be out of the office on Friday, but
will be in
  all next week if
            you care to discuss any of these matters.

  Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

  Purchase/Sale Agreement






             <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

            Dan:

            First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
  authorizes the City
            Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

            More importantly, I need to inform you that our
senior
  management has
            reviewed the referenced contract; I have been
asked to
  present additional
            changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration
and to
  raise questions
            about certain of its terms and conditions.

            Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and
proceed to the
  end of the
            exhibits.

            1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of
the Enfolio
  agreement
            which
            should be deleted.

            2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not
contain
  the words "1st
            of
            January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until
the parties
  have signed the
            contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach
as of the
  date it signs
            the
            contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires
the City
  to proffer the
            to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

            3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City
(Customer)
  wants Enron
            (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic
Transaction,
  as defined.
            Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should
be
  changed to "shall."

            4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first
sentence:
  Buyer's Requested
            Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's
failure to
  Schedule the
            Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default.
            How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity
fit into a
  Seller's
            Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested
Quantity does
  not include a
            Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is
the reason
  for the
            omission?

            5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line
23 refers
  to "reasonable
            attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys'
fees."
  To be internally
            consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable
attorneys' fees."

            6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A
statement
  showing the
            determination of the Termination Payment will be
prepared.
  It's unclear
            whether the City is entitled to review and
challenge the
  determination
            before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The
City
  should be entitled
            to
            receive a copy of the determination and to
question it
  before it is
            obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please
clarify,
  or permit the
            City to exercise these rights.

            7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering
Event will
  exist if a
            bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.
Is this
  (under
            bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within
which one
  may seek
            dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer
to the 11
  USC section
            that
            backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

            8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30
days" to "5
  days."  The
            City
            is concerned with the number of days that Enron
may be
  permitted to fail to
            Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by
Enron.

            9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a
default by
  Enron Corp.
            (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's
default in
  this regard?
            Please explain.

            10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed
to refer
  to "the Company"
            ?

            11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the
force
  majeure provision
            as drafted.  It states that the parties must
perform even if
  a FM event
            (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties
from
  performing with the
            60-day period stated therein.  There is no such
limitation
  under California
            law in the absence of a contract provision to the
contrary.

            12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron
translate the last
  sentence?  We
            don't understand it.

            13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why
Section 3 is
  referred to?

            14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add
"reasonable"
  before
            "attorneys' fees.

             15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP
means
  generally accepted
            accounting principles, consistently applied, with
respect to
  Company, and
            governmental generally accepted accounting
principles,
  consistently
            applied,
            with respect to Customer."

            16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete
"two
  percent over".  The
            City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City
believes
  the 2% over prime
            should not apply to it.

            17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What
does Enron
  believe the
            City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million
threshold is
  mentioned.  Also,
            what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an
investment grade
  rating?

            18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we
have agreed
  that the
            opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps
and
  warranties are being
            deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties"
is
  nevertheless included
            in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted,
because the
  City has not
            undertaken a court search as is our custom and
practice
  whenever we issue
            an
            opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is
not ...
  Party."

            19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
  "reasonable" before
            "attorneys' fees."

            20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by
"to the
  extent it has a
            legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

            21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We
do not as a
  matter of
            legal
            policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate
disputes.
  Is Enron
            amenable to mediation?  This process is less
formal and less
  costly in my
            opinion.

            22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like
the
  Agreement to include
            a list of employees for Company and Customer who
are
  authorized to trade on
            behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be
added to
  this section to
            this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as
an
  Exhibit C.

            Thank you so much for considering these issues.
There are
  others which I
            hope to receive from staff next week and which I
will
  forward to you for
            response.

            Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be
out of
  town after today
            until Wednesday, March 7.

            Sincerely,

            Grant Kolling

A Sixth Grade student has a penis so large, his parents warn him not to have 
anything to do with girls.  They caution him he could easily kill someone.  
Through the grapevine, his teacher learns about his unusual size, keeps him 
after school and suggests they have sex.  He refuses expressing concern he 
might kill her.   She laughs and scoffs at the idea and says she will elect 
to be on top, in complete control, and nothing bad can happen.  He 
reluctantly agrees but the teacher experiences such wonderful sensations, she 
faints from pure joy.  Thinking he's killed her, the student runs from the 
class room sobbing and crying, "Oh my God!... I killed her!  I killed her!"  
All at once he stops dead in his tracks, and a look of dawning comprehension 
appears on his face as he says,... "Wait just a minute!  I didn't kill her.  
She committed suicide!"

in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can 
sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it 
sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which 
is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than 
the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to

With respect to the Daily Contract Quantity: MaxDQ on the PERC Transaction 
Agreement, should 'scheduled' in "scheduled by Buyer" be capitalized in 
relation to the followin definition in the Master Agreement.  I don't know 
the answer, but thought it may be relevant.  This definition does not seem to 
be the same as what scheduled in the Transaction Agreement is used for.  I am 
wondering if requested might be a better term for this use.

Let me know what you think.

Steve

"Scheduling" or "Schedule," when used in reference to Seller, means to make 
Gas available, or cause Gas to be made available, at the Delivery Point(s) 
for delivery to or for the account of Buyer, including making all Pipeline 
nominations, and when used in reference to Buyer, means to cause Buyer's 
Transporter to make available at the Delivery Point(s) transportation 
capacity sufficient to permit Buyer's Transporter to receive on a firm basis 
the quantities Seller has available at such Delivery Point(s), including 
making all Pipeline nominations.  Gas shall be deemed to have been Scheduled 
when confirmed by Transporter.

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

Dan,

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

I need your help with this confirmation please. 
It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
should confirm these deals.
We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
information, please contact me.



Thanks

Based on Stacy's comments yesterday, I have changed the last sentence of 
11.1.  Her comment was that the last sentence of 11.1 said events of force 
majeure may inclucde and 11.2 said events of force majeure shall include.  
Now they both say shall however I have tied it to the preceding sentence of 
11.1.

I spoke with Tracy Geaccone after our meeting yesterday.  Tracy is expecting 
to receive about $590,000.00, the $463,609.20 we discussed in yesterday's 
meeting plus a $127,000.00 adjustment we processed  in mid to late 1997.

Melba told me this morning that  the $127,000.00 was for a 9612 production 
month adjustment.  What I need to know is how this adjustment was applied to 
Enron Louisiana's account, did we 1) write it off, 2)  pass it through to 
some other Enron entity via check, wire transfer, or journal voucher or 3) 
cut a check to Trans Canada?  Who do I talk to about this?

Also, Inez Habel (works for Tracy) said the money should go to company 366.  
Gary, Darron, I believe someone in your group should probably talk to Inez.  
Her extension is 3-7720.

Next question, should we pass on the $463,609.20 to Tracy or should we wait 
until we find out what happened to the $127,000.00?  I believe it depends on 
how long it will take to research the $127,000.00.

Comments, Questions?

I would recommend that once the trueup information is available and verified, 
a credit statement be prepared and forwarded to Heartland, such statement to 
provide that the credit statement is to be used in determining the next 
month's (April) prepayment.  I would not wire them the true-up amount so long 
as we have any reason to believe that they will continue to be in some level 
of operation requiring some level of gas purchases.  John, any comments.

So what should the invoice look like for the March prepayment?  Should I just 
bill them the 1,500/day at the NX3+.34 next Monday; let them pre-pay that and 
then wire them whatever money is owed back to them after the trueup (probably 
sometime mid-April after the pipeline statements have been received and the 
volumes have been acutalized)?  Or does somebody want to estimate what the 
buyback volume and price would be so I can deduct that up front?

Subject: Re: Heartland Invoice for March  

Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last 
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next 
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back 
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas 
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the 
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase 
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that 
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that 
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the 
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and 
trueup each month for the prior months activity.  

John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?

Dan - please confirm for Dan that the pricing will be different after the 
last three trading days of the month for the NYMEX contract.  Dan - can you 
make sure you check with Patrice for this exact number so Chuck can send the 
invoice.  Thanks.

John,

When do you want me to send an invoice to Heartland so they can pre-pay for 
March gas?  I can bill the 1,500/day but I'll need the pricing.  Are we still 
going to use the NX3+.34 for March or do you want to use something else?  The 
NX3 will not be available for March until Monday so that would be the 
earliest I could send it using that price.

Let me know...
Chuck

Attached please find a red-line redraft of the Confirmation Letters.  I 
understand that Enron will not sign the confirmation letters with Southern 
until Enron North America Corp. has finalized its arrangements with the Elba 
Island Terminal entity having the gas available at the tailgate of the Elba 
Island facility.  Is this correct.  If so, I do not need to make ENA's 
contract with such entity a condition precedent to the Southern Confirmation 
Letters.  Please advise.

Don't know what you are talking about.  They gave Sylvia their form with 
their view of how the world should revolve around their wishes in October 
2000.  She sent it up here is late January for Legal's initial review.  I 
understand it mimics the Utilicorp agreement.  If you have some incite that 
would lead you to believe that they would sign our Master, please send me a 
credit worksheet so that I can prepare a Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  Also please give me a contact so that we can forward the new 
contract to that person for execution.

I feel we should arrange to cancel the contract formally for good records.  

All the people I knew in HMPC have already left the company.  Understand the 
plant been sold!!

Nicor Petroleum - been re-organized, all the personnel who was involved in 
the fuel contract have also left the company.  

I will also be leaving Enron at the end of the year for retirement.

Enron Fuels International (EFI) has a long term gasoil supply agreement with 
HMPC which has not been used for several years. What is the current and 
future status of the plant? If the plant is not going to operate and not need 
liquid fuel deliveries, then I need someone within HMPC to send a formal 
notice to EFI cancelling the fuel supply contract. We have requested this 
several times over the past few years to no avail.

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

Kim,
 The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having 
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.  
 The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction 
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and 
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be 
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
 The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you 
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase 
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these 
assets for them.  Repricing should work.

 Call me if you have any further questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I added Section 8.9 in your CPS file below incorporating "Utilization of
Small Business Concerns," a clause we are required as a municipality to
incorporate in all of our contracts.  I added it with the Word tracking
feature "in red" so you would not have to type it in yourself.  Let me know
if it causes your company any qualms.

As far as your question regarding purchase orders, all of our purchases from
Enron will reference the same purchase order so that you may use the same
number on each invoice.

to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San

Mr. Wood,

As requested, Enfolio shortened and simplified the section on
Representations and Warranties.  The new language is highlighted on page 2
of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Sounds like legal mumbo jumbo. I would advise getting John't input in case
he is more familiar with the reasoning behind this jargon.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Grant,
 I have incorporated the language you provided to me in the attached 
document.  I have been informed by the Corporate Secretary's office that they 
will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the person executing the 
contract for ENA is authorized to execute contracts for ENA.  No other party 
signs as to form or terms, however, the officer executing for ENA will 
require that the deal person and I initial on the line next to his 
signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft resolution.  ENA will accept 
the enacted resolution and will not require that the City Attorney issue an 
opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable, please print off 2 
originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me for ENA's approval 
and signature.  Once the contract is fully executed, I will return one fully 
executed original to you for the City's file.

For your review and suggestions.....

F.Y.I., there are two partners in this lease --  Enernet and Quantum.  
Enernet operates the wells, but the parties have not worked out a JOA yet, so 
each party wants a term sheet.  I guess I'll send them both the same terms, 
however I'll need to indicate that the MDQ is for 100% of the lease and 
therefore, each party will only get their % of the MDQ based on their 
ownership.   Actually, after typing all this, I hope they do a JOA and we 
contract with only one party.  

Sorry to waste e-mail space.....Thanks.

Dan, istead of assigning the contract I would prefer to set up another 
contract under HPLC and assign that one.
What do you think?
Also, I need to amend the Southern union contract  at Austin (Colorado River 
Sation) to refect a swap from index to fixed price.

Hi Dan,

I am of the view that separate guarantees should be put in place.  As a 
result, we will forward to Engage later today a revised master agreement 
which addresses guarantees which relate solely to Enron Canada Corp.   If you 
have any concerns, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will assume that you are 
co-ordinating getting the appropriate guarantees relating to Enron North 
America Corp.

Mark,

I had remembered our previous conversation regarding having ENA and ECC on 
the seperate guaranty's.  If we need to have two seperate guaranty's please 
coordinate with Dan Hyvl to have separate guaranty's issued.  I have attached 
another amended credit worksheet which detail the guaranty amounts required.  
Please note that as a result of current market conditions, we need to have 
the draft contract and guaranty's sent to the counterparty as soon as 
possible.  Also my credit contact at Engage is a lady named Sandra 
(403-297-1476) and I have reviewed with her our needs, if Suzzi Sethi does 
not understand our urgency on this, please communicate this to Sandra.  I 
will be out the rest of the week and will not be able to be contacted.

Thanks
Russell.

Hey Russell,

We talked about this point earlier (see an e-mail to you dated September 22, 
2000) and we agreed that the guarantees would not reference both Enron North 
America and Enron Canada Corp.  There were a number of reasons for this (ie. 
complexity regarding future amendments, the differences/peculiarities between 
Canadian and American law, possible "permanent establishment" issues we had 
discussed, etc.).  You may also want to look at the e-mail I sent to you on 
September 26, 2000 (re: the East desk deals with ENA).

Is this not the case anymore?  I think it is better to have separate 
guarantees for all of the reasons mentioned in the September 22, 2000 e-mail, 
the September 26, 2000 e-mail and this e-mail.

Please let me know.

Mark Powell

Hey Mark,

Are you ready for some more fun, I have attached the Credit Worksheet for 
Engage Canada.  Please read the comments at the bottom of the worksheet 
pertaining to the guaranty's.

Call with any questions.

John,

Our situation in Nicaragua is that we are on hold pending authorization from 
the government to start commissioning.  This is currently a delicate subject 
and I do not want to receive fuel until we have started commissioning.

We have approx 15 days of fuel onboard to support commissioning, so I can 
afford to postpone fuel delivery about two weeks after we start commissioning.

Therefore, what I am requesting is that EFI/Glencore allow me to provide a 10 
day notice for the first fuel delivery to Nicaragua.  Physically we are ready 
in that all the tanks, pipes hoses, etc... are in place.  This is a 
commercial issue right now.

Please advise if a 10 day notice will be acceptable to EFI/Glencore.

Regards,

Tito

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

 I have reviewed the attached form of contract.  My comments are that a 
limitation of liability section similar to section 13.2 from the Duke form 
should be added and that (ii) of Section X (C0) be deleted unless the company 
can make the warranty relating to all gas being ultimately consumed in 
Texas.  Please call if you need anything further.

HSC minus $1.4075 = final price.

Unify, research & input from employees in other departments (Ami Chokshi, 
Daren Farmer, etc.)

The spreadsheet has 2 tabs.  The first has the "Contractual Volumes", except 
for a new contract that can't be located & one that doesn't reference any 
volumes.  The second tab has the "Actual Volumes" obtained from Sales 
Invoices in Unify.

If you need anything else or any clarification, please let me know.

Gregg,
We want to attach a copy of the Bonepile lease to the Enron Gas Purchase
Agreement.
EOW has copies of the lease and I think North American Petroleum LC kept the
original lease.
Could you please fax a copy of the lease to Dan Bump and to Dan Hyvl.
Copies made from our copies were not clear enough.

You might need to overnight a clean copy of the lease to Dan Bump at Enron
in Denver.
Dan can let you know if your faxed copy will suffice.

Dan Bump's fax 303 534 0552
Dan Hyvl's fax 713 646 3490

Thanks
Doug

    A small boy walks into his mother's room and catches her topless.
     "Mummy, Mummy, what are those?" he says pointing to her breasts. "Well,
son,"she says, These are balloons, and when you die, they inflate and float
    you up to heaven," Incredibly, he appears to believe this explanation
and
goes
    off quite satisfied.
    Two days later while his mother is making tea, he rushes into the
kitchen.
    "Mummy, mummy, Aunt Eliza is dying!" "What do you mean?" says his
    mother."Well she's out in the garden shed, lying on the floor with both
of
    her balloons out. Dad's trying to blow themup for her and she keeps
yelling,
"God, I'm coming! God, I'm coming!"

Brant,
 EnergyOne has responded to the requested changes.  They agree to the 
revision of the MAC language but threw in a money wrench by adding a warm and 
fuzzy triggering event  if a party refused to provide security within 48 
hours of a reasonable request therefore.  No standard is provided as to the 
reason for the request.    They also deleted the original Collateral 
Threshold language which was in their first draft.  Please respond to these 
matters to me and to Sylvia Pollan.

FEMALE FLYERS

As the airliner pushed back from the gate, the flight attendant gave the 
passergers the usual information regarding seat belts etc. Finally, she said, 
"Now sit back and enjoy your trip while your captain, Judith Campbell and 
crew take you safely to your destination."?

Joe sitting in the 8th row thought to himself, "Did hear her right; is the 
captain a woman? I think I better have scotch and soda. When the attendants 
came by with drink cart, he said, "Did I understand you right?  Is the 
captain a woman?"

"Yes," said the attendant, "In fact, this entire crew is female."

"My God," said Joe, "I'd better have two scotch and sodas. I don't know what 
to think of all those women up there in the cockpit."

"That's another thing," said the attendant, "We no longer call it the 
cockpit."

Dan, could you please take a look at this confidentiality agreement that I 
received back from GWF?  The attached version below was changed only to add 
their name and commodity; otherwise it's identical to the version I sent them 
(and that I had gotten from you).  Please let me know if it's acceptable and

So you do check your mail.  Yes, I am doing this.  I ordered my equipment 
yesterday.  I went with the Advanced Desktop.  The difference was $333.  I 
also paid for additional upgrades of speed and memory.  Call me if you want 
specifics.  It works best if you use the telephone line when ordering, at 
least that is what the Dell representative sold me on.

The red lettering is what Sithe is suggesting as the formulas for the October 
transaction
agreements.  I believe that you get the same answer as what we had 
suggested.  If you
get the same answer as I did, let's just go with how they have it written.

We will also have to add the other boiler plate language changes that we sent 
to them for
the September transaction agreement.

Irene,
 These become HPL contracts on the effective date of the assignment.  As such 
I would use that date as the effective contract date and the assignment 
date.  The original contact date can remain the same as in the contract 
file.  Tom/Steve - Do you agree?

Dan, to follow up on the phone message I just left for you!

In the ongoing process of automating TRRC Sales Tariff Filings,  we have 
encountered several issues for which we need legal clarification in reference 
to all the sales contracts that were assigned from ENA Sales to HPL Sales.

What date should be filed as the Original Contract Date?

 What date should be filed as the Contract Effective Date?

What date should be used for the Contract Amendment Date - i.e. the 
assignment date?

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  The marked 
form is now in black.  I made the requested change in the Term section.  That 
section defines a Early Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 
contract years.  As such no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract 
section.  Please call if you need anything further.  

        Thanks, Dan

Sheri:

The physical power products on DynegyDirect have now been approved, with the 
exception of the West firm product.  Thus, go ahead and set up the East power 
traders to trade physical power on behalf of EPMI.  Do not set up any West 
traders to trade on DynegyDirect until you receive confirmation from me that 
the West products are okay.  

Please make clear to the power traders that they may trade ONLY physical 
power with their EPMI passwords.  If they want to trade financial power 
products, they must obtain an ENA password (since Enron North America, not 
Enron Power Marketing is the Enron entity that trades derivative products).  
There are a couple of changes to the power swaps currently posted that need 
to be made before I can approve the issuance of passwords to trade financial 
products (plus I want Brent Hendry's sign off as well).

The following lawyers must approve the commodity groups set out below before 
you can proceed to set up additional users of Dynegy Direct:

Dan Hyvl:  Physical Gas
Marcus Nettelton:  Liquids  (products plus on-line General Terms and 
Conditions to be approved)
Brent Hendry:  Financial Products

The ENA gas traders will only need to receive one password for physical and 
financial products.  However, the liquids traders will, like the EPMI 
traders, receive an EGL password for physical liquid products and an ENA 
password for financial liquid products, and will need to be instructed that 
they need to use the passwords accordingly.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call with any questions or comments.

Happy holidays!

Leslie

Dan,

Attached is my attempt at rewriting the Kaiser Agency Agreement that I sent 
you last.  Please have a look at it and let me what additional changes are 
needed.
The basic concept of the deal is simple:

Enron sells Kaiser Gas at index price
Enron agrees to provide market and pricing information
Kaiser designates Enron as agent to manage its pipeline capacity
Kaiser can purchase incremental quantities of gas pursuant to the Enfolio 
agreement
Kaiser can sell back unwanted quantities of gas pursuant to the Enfolio 
agreement

Please let me know how quickly we can turn this around, I'd like to get him 
something this week.

Sincerely,

David Fuller

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, "Oh There you
are!" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said "Material may become

transparent in water." I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!

 Please review my mark-up.  We need to keep the distinction between HPL and 
GM throughout the document.  Remember GM is the marketing affiliate and HPL 
is the pipeline.  Call me if you have any questions.

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

 The transaction agreement (2000-90crfm.doc) still needs to be finalized by 
including the missing information to be added in the blanks as well as 
finalization of the price to be applicable.  The contract documents should be 
in final form and ready for signature.  Please review both documents and let 
me have your comments. If the documents meet with your approval, please

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Under the "Spot Price (Per MMBtu)" paragraph, it currently reads "The Spot

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be 
changed.  Also, keep an eye
out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure 
language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?) 
subject
to force Majeure?

Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

St. Mary's Production, LLC and ENA contract (Gary Bryan's "Preston" deal), 
Melissa Graves and I will assume responsibility for having our records and 
deals properly updated.  We would also be happy to perform the same task for 
the Entrada/Crescendo contracts if you wish.

In any event, we need copies of the conveyancing documents for at least the 
"Preston" deal and, if you wish us to update the Entrada/Cresendo deal also, 
the conveyancing documents for that deal too.

When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

I think this works for covering ENA for any HPL breach; however, I'd like to 
see explicit language that requires HPL to make ENA whole in the event the 
counterparty does not pay ENA.

Thanks,
Tanya

Cathy,
 At the request of Mitch Dutton, I have reviewed the form of 311 and 
intrastate gas transportation agreements provided to AEP by Duke Energy 
Guadalupe Pipeline, Inc. and by EPGT Texas Pipeline, L.P.   As we discussed 
this morning, these agreements appear to be the standard form of agreement 
utilized by these counterparties.  Although I have no authority to approve 
them for execution by AEP, had they been provided to me for execution by HPL, 
I would approve them for execution.  
 Please note the Balancing and Penalties provision of the agreements for the 
charges which these parties could impose should receipts and deliveries get 
out of balance.  If time permitted I would suggest that these charges be 
negotiated to something closer to the actual costs incurred by the 
transporter.   However, it has been my experience that these parties are 
reluctant to change the standard form for standard transportation services.   
 No contract documents have been provided concerning the TXU Lone Star 
Pipeline.  The only documents faxed were two transportation services request 
forms.

Dan,

We have a customer - True Oil Company - that would like us to gather and buy 
their gas in the Powder River.
They do not want a gathering agreement. They only want a purchase agreement. 
They are willing to commit that the reserves will flow through Enron's 
facilities but do not want to sign a gathering agreement.
We do not want to purchase their gas for an agreed to rate for more than one 
year.
We want the reopener in the purchase agreement.
Their idea is that we would purchase the gas at CIG index minus $0._____ and 
if Enron is not purchasing the gas that a third party will have to 
pay/negotiate with Enron for the gathering.

The minus would include all gathering - field and Ft Union, fuel, shrink, 
margin, etc.

Do you have any thoughts on this??

Mike

Also, on the Appendix 1 of the purchase agreement - Force Majeure - I think 
we can take out the last line that talks about Y2K related problems.
On Exhibit D for Scott Sitter's address, the street number should come before 
Denver, Co - I know I did this!!!

Not with all of their changes.  We were going back to our original language 
relating to representations and implied warranties.  Otherwise, I believe 
that their language only deleted reference to a Texas law designed to protect 
individuals from big business making improper warranties, i.e. triple damages 
for little guy, big guy only gets his damages.

The GTC confirm that we sent to them did not require them to sign.  It is

My understanding, after discussing the matter with Jim Carr, is that the 
debtor is going to enter into an agreement  which Enron is preparing.  
Regarding Court approval neither of us believe it is reguired.

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the 
above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want 
to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like 
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Thanks, Dan.

Janet,
 I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern.  
First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage 
protection.  Specifically, 
 Section 4.4 --- HPL should be the confirming party.
 Section 4.5 --- HPl also needs to have the right to call for security.  
Clause should be balanced.
 Section 5.5a -- "its best efforts" should be changed to "commercially 
reasonable efforts".
 Sections 5.8 & 5.9 --  Need clauses addressing "undertakes by Buyer" and 
"overtakes by Buyer".  
 Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in 
this section.
 Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we 
agree to such?
 Article 10 - Force Majeure -  Need to add Enron language as to items which 
are not force majeure.
 Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early 
Termination, and Termination Damage provisions.
 Also, need to add provisions for limitation of liability and waiver of 
consequential damages.

 Let me know how you would like to proceed.  I do not think that they will 
agree to make any of the changes we would need to do the deal.  Would they be 
willing to contract using the GISB form of agreement?

See attached contract below.  Ignore 4.1 and 4.2, those will have to be 
changed.  Also, keep an eye
out in 4.4 - the default language for confirmations; 10.2 - the Force Majeure 
language; 18.2 - 3 rd party beneficiary; and 10.4 - transportion is not (?) 
subject
to force Majeure?

Thanks,

Janet,

Attached is our "standard" gas enabling agreement that we plan to use with
Enron.  It is the same agreement we put in place last year when Enron did
not submit a bid.

If you will provide proper corporate / address information for Enron we will
generate an original contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Charlotte,
 Please explain what you are referring to when you state that Article 12.7 
was omitted by accident.  My copy of the signed agreement has 12.7.  I am 
attaching the proposed Amendment for your review and comments.   I added the 
Gas Daily Midpoint Price to  be used as a default index when a index was not 
specified and for online transactions.  Please review and let me have your 
comments,  if okay, please start the execution process and forward 2 to me 
for signature by ENA.

Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a 
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.

Brian Riley contacted me regarding the subject company and the fact that HPL 
had overpaid them to the tune of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) and would 
it be appropriate for HPL to withhold that amount from the next payment being 
sent to Upstream.  The documentation that has been provided to me shows that 
this amount relates to overpayments made in 1997 and early 1998.  The 1997 
payments were made pursuant to a spot contract and that they had confirmed a 
nomination of 500 a day however, Killam Oil Company, the operator of the 
wells, has made a reallocation of volumes from these wells from the parties 
that Upstream represents to Enron Oil and Gas Company.  The information 
provided does not indicate when Killam made the reallocation.  Based on the 
reallocation, HPL or its predecessor has paid Upstream for 97,384 MMBtu that 
has now been allocated to EOG.  I am told that Upstream has not denied its 
responsibility for repaying the money, only that it needed time to collect 
the money from the parties that it represents.  Upstream's attorney, Ty Kelly 
written correspondence indicates that the Spot contract was not complete 
because it did not provide a document evidencing the delivery point and 
volumes.  That contract provides that the remittance advice serves as the 
confirmation evidencing the transaction.  He also stated that the volumes 
should have been sold to HPL under the Big Cowboy agreement which they did 
not have a copy of.  Brian Riley has indicated that the purchase price was 
the same under the Big Cowboy and the Spot contract.  Kelly also indicated 
that since HPL's agreements routinely provide for arbitration, the issue 
should be resolved through arbitration.

Based on my review of the information available, HPL should withhold the sum 
of $328,508.61(should be $238,508.61) from the next payment to be made to 
Upstream and hold such sum in suspense until the issue is resolved.  HPL 
needs to be aware that in the event it is not able to prevail on its claim 
for such sum, it will need to remit such amount together with interest to 
Upstream.

Chevron Phillips- we have a Master Firm between HPL and Chevron Chemical - 
would it be OK (and easier) to get it assigned to the new entity?

BASF Corporation - ditto comment on Roche on preference for a Master Swap 
rather than an ISDA - they are at ground zero, and would find the ISDA 
intimidating

Air Products, Inc.-  no premium - flat to index 

Roche Vitamans- believe they are a strong (Swiss) credit 

Thanks

Lee,

Regarding these industrial:

Chevron Phillips- Veronica Espinoza an analyst here in the group had looked 
into them and can provide you the status on this, I think she was going to 
put a Master Firm Contract in place.
Is this with HPL?

BASF Corporation - I will follow up with this, the analyst who was looking 
into it, recently left Enton and provided me no insight into this.

Air Products, Inc.-  We do have a guaranty from Air Products and Chemicals 
for HPL, I presume this transaction will be with HPL.  What premium are you 
looking at?

Roche Vitamans- We have a file on this counterparty, although I am not 
familiar with them, either Veronica or myself will take a look and get back 
to you.

Thanks,
Russell

Need to get an update on a couple of deals:

"Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, LP" - did you get the information that 
you needed??

"BASF Corporation"   -   I requested an ISDA a few weeks ago and have 
forgotten who was working on it - do you have an update??


PLUS a couple of new deals:

"Air Products, Incorporated" - a one year deal out of October for 3,000 
MMBtu/d, priced at Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel flat, guarantee from "Air 
Products and Chemicals, Inc."

"Roche Vitamins Inc." - I'd like to request a Master Swap for these guys - 
volumes would be small, less than 500 MMBtu/d, no more than one year term.  I 
really donlt want an ISDA - that would blow their mind, I'm really looking 
for the Enron Master Swap


Call me at 3.5923 when you're ready to discuss above

Thanksgiving is set at Mom's for Thursday, November 23, 2000 at noon.  Hope 
to see each of you there.   Try to cheer Mom up.  She seems to be a little

that she has no outside activities to occupy her mind.

Dan, I was just checking to see if there was an update on Murphy Gas 
Gathering - they have applied for EOL and are still hanging out.  If it 
appears that this is going to be a long-term process, please let me know and 
perhaps we'll close them out for now until we get the acceptable language 
worked out.  

Also, I've responded back to Gibson Petroleum re: their confidentiality

Grant,  
 Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
 7. Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a petition 
or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement of a 
proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the protection of 
creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such proceeding remains 
undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed against the Affected 
Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all steps to have such 
proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with reasonable 
documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to be 
dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to 
effectuate such dismissal,"
 8.  Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
 13. I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
 21. I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first attempt 
to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding Arbitration by 
mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue to the 
satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be resolved by the 
use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable resolution?
 22. We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to enter into 
transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever answers the 
trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the company.  
However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of the people 
on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date the contract is 
signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter into a transaction 
with the city will not be limited to the initial contact list.  Of course, 
the city could always attempt to contact someone on the initial contact 
list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?  

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.  
          Dan.

Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge, though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
  (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

  Grant,
       I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
  do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
  in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
       1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
       2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
  when the contract would be executed by the City.
       3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
       4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
  Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
  a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
       5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
       6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
  provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
  statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
  then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
  Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
  should not be necessary to attain closure.
       7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
  be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
  obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
  the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
  pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
  otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
       8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
  During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
  period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
  scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
       9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
  separate rating applies to ENA.
       10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
       11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
  event of Force Majeure.
       12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
  due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
  language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
  that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
  written.
       13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
  that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
  were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
  it in using language that had been provided by the City.
       14.  I added the word "reasonable".
       15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
       16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
  provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
  over prime language.
       17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
  needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
  grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
  rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
       18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
  requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
  have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
  know that before we execute the Contract.
       19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
       20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
  should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
  contract.
       21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
  to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
  willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
       22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
  Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
  allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
  that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
  Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
  We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
  employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
  enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

       I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
  you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






   <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

  Dan:

  First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
  Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

  More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
  reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
  changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
  about certain of its terms and conditions.

  Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
  exhibits.

  1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
  which
  should be deleted.

  2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
  of
  January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
  contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
  the
  contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
  to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

  3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
  (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
  Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

  4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
  Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
  Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
  How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
  Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
  Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
  omission?

  5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
  attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
  consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

  6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
  determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
  whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
  before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
  to
  receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
  obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
  City to exercise these rights.

  7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
  bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
  bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
  dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
  that
  backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

  8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
  City
  is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
  Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

  9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
  (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
  Please explain.

  10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
  ?

  11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
  as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
  (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
  60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
  law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

  12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
  don't understand it.

  13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

  14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
  "attorneys' fees.

   15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
  accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
  governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
  applied,
  with respect to Customer."

  16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
  City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
  should not apply to it.

  17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
  City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
  what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

  18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
  opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
  deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
  in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
  undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
  an
  opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

  19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
  "attorneys' fees."

  20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
  legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

  21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
  legal
  policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
  amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
  opinion.

  22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
  a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
  behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
  this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

  Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
  hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
  response.

  Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
  until Wednesday, March 7.

  Sincerely,

  Grant Kolling

            Grant,
                 I have incorporated the language you provided
to me in
  the attached
            document.  I have been informed by the Corporate
Secretary's
  office that
            they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency
showing that the
  person
            executing the contract for ENA is authorized to
execute
  contracts for ENA.
            No other party signs as to form or terms, however,
the
  officer executing
            for ENA will require that the deal person and I
initial on
  the line next to
            his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
  resolution.  ENA will
            accept the enacted resolution and will not require
that the
  City Attorney
            issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is
acceptable,
  please print off
            2 originals, have them approved, signed and
forward to me
  for ENA's
            approval and signature.  Once the contract is
fully
  executed, I will return
            one fully executed original to you for the City's
file.

I forgot to give you her number in the last email.  It is 53218.  I apologize 
for her not calling you as well as myself.  I talked to her immediately after 
we spoke and she assured my she was going to call immediately.  I did not 
spend much time on the phone with her but the little bit I did get was that 
she did not see that meter on any of her nomination reports and was not aware 
of any gas from them.  Also, generally, if a producer does not agree with a 
nomination from their supply points, they just don't confirm it.  If it was 
suppose to be confirmed, the phone calls will start at that time.

 Again, I apologize for not giving you her name immediately.  Hopefully the 
problem is or will be resolved quickly.  Let me know if there is anything 
else I can help with.

Steve

No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

That's great Dan, the extension is actually only 6 months (Aug 01 - Jan 02).  
Also, can we make it an "ammendment" to the existing deal?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

These are general conceptual concepts that need to be addressed.  I have not 
attempted to redraft the language, only to point out areas where we will need 
to work on modifications to the Contract language.


1. Section 5.01 Provision needs to be changed so that Termination Payment is 
first paid by Company to Customer and if not paid by Company after notice, 
then the Customer would be entitled to make a draw under the Surety Bond.

2. Section 5.03   Provision needs to be changed to reflect that the initial 
bond term shall be __5__ years.  At the end of the initial term, the Company 
shall either replace the bond with a new bond for remaining  term of 
prepayment, provide a letter of credit for the remaining amount of 
prepayment, or provide a corporate guaranty.  

3. Section 7.01 This provision should be okay under the Commodity Futures 
Modernization Act of 2000 enacted as of December 14, 2000.  The Customer 
needs to represent to the Company that the Customer is an "eligible contract 
participant" under the Act.

4. Section 10.02 10.02.05 - Company has no control on the substance of the 
opinion of counsel for the surety bond provider.   The substance of such 
opinion should be as negotiated between the bond providers counsel and the 
Customer.   10.02.06  Should Customers inablility to get funding be an out 
for the Customer?   10.02.08  Likewise, should the Customer's inability to 
complete any swap agreements be an out for the Customer?

5. Section 21.01 21.01.02  Company should get aleast 5 business days notice 
of nonpayment before the Customer should be entitled to cause an Early 
Termination Date.  21.01.03  As previously noted in 5.03, Company should have 
the option to provide alternative surety - as referenced in the Term Sheet.  
Contract and Term Sheet need to be made consistent.

6. Section 21.03 and 21.04   Provisions of the Contract need to be consistent 
so that all obligations of the parties are netted before any payment is 
made.  Also 21.03 should first provide for payment by the Company and if not 
made, then by the surety or other security provider.  We shouldn't have to 
pay the Termination Payment to the Customer and then invoice the Customer for 
any Market Exposure Damages under section 21.06.  These should be netted or 
aggregated in computing the Termination Payment.

Grant, I think you need to get involved and explain to Patrice's people the
agreement we have in place currently. Mark does not give us the information
via e-mail on a consistent basis by 9:45am, however the agreement states
that. To date Crestar has been accomodating to Enron but once BP comes into
the AOS agreement the 9:45am deadline will need to become more formal.

Gentlemen, please advise what Enron's position is. I think Mark's last
comment on same makret veveryday would accomodate the defualt contract
number request we originally had in the agreement.

Patrice:
I am unable to commit to knowing what our downstream contracts will be by
the 10:45 deadline that they have set fourth.  In the event that we sell to
a market at the point and there is a long daisy chain involved we may not
get the ultimate downstream contract until 11:15 or sometimes even
intra-day.  I will make every effort to get the downstream info. to
BP/Crestar/Gulf Canada however, I do not think we should take penalties if
our markets are slow providing us the information.

The only solution would be to take our supply to the same maket every day.

Thanks,
Mark

Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

Dan--

This is the only form of netting that Credit provides counterparties.  I'm 
not sure whether Settlements could systematically net certain payments with a 
particular counterparty (and not net the other amouts owed pertaining to 
differing contracts).

Attached below is the generic ENA Netting document that we issue for your 
information.

The Index for pricing in the PERC contracts is based on the average of the 
"spot" price and the "citygate" price as follows:

Calculation of spot price (C):

C = (A+B)/2
Where A is the low and B is the high of the range as reported in the first 
publication of the billing month of "Inside F.E.R.C's Gas Market Report" for 
Chicago citygate.

Calculation of citygate price (E):

E = (D+C)/2
Where D is the price as reported in the first publication of the billing 
month of "Natural Gas Week" for Delivered to Utility, Midwest.

Calculation of Contract Price (F):

F = E x applicable percentage

		 Subject: Brazos VPP - Open issues


Tax Issues

I have spoken with my tax partner, T. Hardie, about a couple of issues.
First is whether we should increase the general partner's share from .0001%
to .0025% in order to reduce a possible risk that Brazos VPP Limited
Partnership might somehow not be treated as a partnership for tax purposes.
T. does not feel strongly about this (in part because the consequences
should not be adverse) and, unless Kevin desires otherwise, I think we
should leave the percentage at .0001%.  (Any tax law with respect to the
minimum .0025% level is probably obsolete now that we have "check-the-box"
elections for tax treatment as a partnership.)  Nora advises me that Stan
is fine with this from an accounting perspective.

The second tax issue is whether Agave, as depositor under the Trust
Agreement, can be tax matters partner for the Trust (which will also elect
to be taxed as a partnership).  Since only a partner can be tax matters
partner, it appears that one of the Class B Certificateholders -- i.e.,
Bank of America -- must be the tax matters partner.  The Servicer can of
course assist with preparation of income tax filings.

Balancing Agreement

Attached below is a revised Balancing Agreement, with the changes discussed
on Monday night by Nora, Tim, Teresa, Bob and me.  The principal change is
to add an indemnity section to this Agreement in place of the indemnity we
want to delete from the Participation Agreement that Bracewell Patterson
has prepared.  This indemnity is based on the Term Sheet and is
considerably narrower, but since we did not discuss it specifically, please
review it carefully.  Please pay attention to the note following the
definition of "Servicer Fee" that suggests that the LIBOR breakage costs
and capital adequacy costs be moved to the new indemnity section.  Nora and
I think that this would be more appealing to the Banks, but Stan may prefer
to have this built into the Servicing Fee.

(See attached file: Balancing Agreement Ver 5 from 4.doc)

Physical Sales Contracts

One of our biggest challenges to a quick closing is getting everyone to
agree on some important features of the master gas and oil purchase/sale
agreements.  The term sheet given to the Banks says the following:

     A.   With respect to each Production Payment under which Brazos
     expects to receive deliveries of natural gas in kind, Brazos shall
     enter into a confirmation under the NGPSA with ENA whereby ENA or ERAC
     shall (1) purchase all gas or oil delivered to the Company in kind
     under such Production Payment and (2) pay floating prices for such gas
     or oil.  The floating prices will be swapped into pre-determined fixed
     prices via an Energy Price Swap Agreement.

     B.   Brazos will dedicate to ENA or ERAC all Production Payment gas or
     oil which is delivered under the Production Payments documents.

     C.   The quantities of gas or oil purchased each month shall consist
     of all gas or oilactually delivered in kind to Brazos during such
     month under the Production Payment.  ENA and ERAC will be notified
     monthly in advance of the amount of gas or oil expected to be
     delivered at each delivery point.

     D.   If the actual quantity of Production Payment hydrocarbons
     delivered to Brazos is less than the scheduled quantity of
     hydrocarbons to be delivered (the "Scheduled Volumes"), and the
     producer has not delivered adjustment quantities of Production Payment
     hydrocarbons to satisfy such deficiency, the Servicer (i.e., Agave,
     the new Enron subsidiary guaranteed by Enron Corp.) will make a
     mandatory advance equal to the value of such deficiency at the
     applicable ENA or ERAC price.

     E.   As consideration for the mandatory advance, Brazos will assign to
     the Servicer the right to receive the Adjustment Quantities (or cash)
     that Brazos is entitled to receive under the Production Payment
     documents related to such delivery under the Production Payment.

In analyzing the physical contracts, and all other components of this deal,
it is important to remember that one purpose of the deal is to lock in, for
at least the 97% debt component of the total financing, a cash flow stream
that amortizes the debt over the entire term of each Production Payment.
The pieces of the deal -- the oil and gas accruing to the Production
Payment, the physical sales contracts, and the swaps -- have to fit
together for the entire life of each Production Payment.

It is also important to remember that if there is a mismatch in cash flows,
it will most likely be made up by payments from Enron Corp. under its
guaranty of Agave's mandatory "balancing" advances.  So it behooves Enron,
as well as the Banks, to make sure that the pieces of the deal fit
together.

It therefore seems to me that the physical contracts need to have the
following features:

1.   the physical contracts need to cover all of the production accruing to
each Production Payment during the life of that Production Payment,
including both scheduled quantities and adjustment quantities.  Therefore
there can be no minimum or maximum limits on quantities taken, and the
right to terminate the physical contracts must be limited to a real
melt-down situation.  It is probably misleading to talk about the scheduled
amounts being on a firm basis.

2.   the physical contracts need to match the commodity price swaps that
ENA will be providing for the scheduled amounts of production, with
floating prices for these scheduled amounts that are identical to the
floating swap prices.  Therefore the Contract Prices for the scheduled
amounts of gas need to key off of Inside FERC and the Contract Prices for
the scheduled amounts of oil need to key off of NYMEX WTI, in each case
with any agreed basis differentials.

3.   the physical contracts need to price the adjustment quantities in a
way that causes the adjustment quantities to generate enough cash to repay
Agave/Enron for any mandatory balancing advances.  The way to do this is to
price any deliveries in excess of the scheduled amounts at the Index Prices
contained in the production payment conveyances.  The Index Prices for gas
in the two existing deals are Gas Daily prices and for oil are NYMEX WTI
less differentials.

4.   the physical contracts need to match the timing of the conveyances for
adjustment quantities.  This is daily for gas deliveries and monthly for
oil deliveries.

5.   the physical contracts need to have a cover formula that protects both
ENA/ERAC and Agave/Enron.  The present formula in the Enfolio contract says
that ENA pays the Contract Price for the scheduled quantities that are
delivered and that Brazos pays the product of the shortfall in scheduled
quantities times the positive remainder, if any, of the Index Price minus
the Contract Price.  We need to change this last feature to say that Brazos
pays this remainder, if positive, but that Brazos also gets a credit is
this remainder is negative.  Tim Proffitt can explain the math to anyone
that wants to understand it, but the basic idea is that if there is a
shortfall, Brazos buys gas from ENA at the Index Price to cover the
shortfall and then ENA pays the Contract Price for the full scheduled
amount.

6.   the contracts need to do away with any concept of frequent trading
over the phone.  Each Production Payment should generate only one written
confirmation.

7.   the contracts need to be clear that netting occurs over all
transactions.  This should protect ENA and ERAC against Brazos owing them
money for one Production Payment where production has substantially shut
down and not having the ability to pay.

In light of the above, we also need to consider whether we are better off
starting with the modern Enfolio form that is designed for true commercial
transactions or whether it makes more sense to add the points described
above to the old Cactus form.

I have reviewed the above proposed confidentiality agreement and have made 
certain modifications which are in line with the confidentiality agreement 
presently in effect between ENA and Markwest.  Since the new agreement is to 
cover Markwest for the period that they are letting Enron review Markwest's 
financials which are scheduled to be publicly released next week, the term 
references therein need to only cover the period from the date hereof until 
such financials are scheduled to be released, which I understand to be next 
week.  The change to Enron Corp was made because the employees who will 
receive the information are now employees of Enron Corp.   Please have your 
attorney contact me if there are any problems with the manner or substance of 
the changes noted in the document.

Hello,

Please prepare an HPL M/P per terms of the attached credit worksheet.  The 
timetable on this is immediate.  Please copy me with the draft by e-mail once 
the contract is prepared.



Also, please prepare an assignment document to move trades (NA0376 and 
NU2813) from Cannon Interests Houston to Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, Inc.  
It should be noted within the assignment document that these trades are 
assumed under the Kinder M/P (yet to be entered into) and that it is these 
credit terms that should apply, not those of the original confirmation.


Everyone has agreed to be flexible on all this in order to wrap this up by 
Friday.  Thanks

Thanks
brant

Jennifer,
 I assisted the trader in documenting a deal that was a retrade of an earlier 
deal.  There is no reason that you can't prepare the confirm for the current 
trade.  Does it modify the existing deal in any manner?  If so, we may need 
to amend the existing deal.  Please advise.

I have a physical forward with the City of Pasedena, traded 09/18/00.  There 
is a master in place, however, I thought you confirmed this counterparty.

Please let me know

Monica,
 Kim Ward asked me to forward the attached general terms and conditions to 
you for your review.  These general terms and conditions are used in 
conjunction with a Confirmation Agreement which would be signed by both 
parties.  The Confirmation Letter sets forth the volumes, delivery point, 
price terms which are to be applicable for the gas to be sold pursuant to the 
general terms and conditions.

Dan,

Today, I entered into some conversations with the City of Palo Alto regarding 
fixing forward gas prices for them.  They have a copy of a Master agreement 
and a copy of an ISDA which are currently in their legal department.  They 
have requested a copy of the GTC language which would allow us to transact in 
the immediate future, although I am still pushing for a Master.  They 
currently have a Power Master in place with EPMI.  

Could you forward a copy of the General Terms and Conditions to Monica 
Padilla with the City of Palo Alto at Monica_Padilla@city.palo-alto.ca.us 
first thing in the morning?  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
issues.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

Yes, I do.  We had all discussed it and decided to use a "belt and 
suspenders" approach and reserved the rights, if any.  You're probably right 
not to mention them.

Thanks!

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the 
above properties.  Short of a mineral search, we have concluded that we want 
to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like 
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Thanks, Dan.

I wanted to advise you that we are researching the term, receipt and delivery 
points, volumes, and associated rates of the two Entex contracts under which 
they are transporting a total of 25,000/d.  I have forwarded the original 
contract and amendments to Gerald Nemec for his review.  He is confirming 
current term, rate language, volumes, and transport points with me.  I will 
keep you advised as I know more about these contracts.

Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

Linda, Elizabeth Hernandez thought I should contact you about ENA Texas 
contracts.  Are the contracts we have in place as ENA sufficient to handle 
deals that once was done as HPL but will be done as ENA going forward?  We 
are wanting to make sure that we do not have to renegotiate contracts with 
our counterparties or be caught off guard by a contract not being in place 
once the AEP transaction is complete.  Basically, do we have the contracts in 
place to hit the floor running after the HPL sale to AEP goes through?

Dan Hyvl will call Gary Lamphier with the meter number.  This should go in 
the system as soon as we get the meter number form Dan Hyvl.  We can put this 
deal in the system before the contracts are signed, but we do not want to 
send the Osborn until we have a signed agreement  from ENTEX.   Also, do not 
pay Osborn until we recieve an allocation statement.

I wanted to let you know that we still do not have a deal in the system for 
Osborn.  Gary told Julie that the contract went back to legal and that he was 
waiting to hear from them before he did anything.  You can read Julie's email 
below.  Can you help with the particulars of the deal, especially the point?  
Gary is not sure.  The only detail I got from Osborn was that the price 
should be HSC - 0.20.  I would like to try and get their check out on Monday, 
if we can get the deal in today.

Dan, Could you please review the attached proposal to Jacksonville Electric 
Authority.  Enron is buying (for $0) the right to put a long term gas supply 
deal to JEA.  JEA has verbally agreed to the concept.  If they are fine with 
these commercial terms the next step will be to turn in into an executable 
contract.

Thanks for your assistance, - Mike

Just to clarify, are we all putting the documents together for ourselves and
faxing execution pages with originals to follow?  Or am I to wait to receive
an original before executing and faxing?

Michael,
     I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two
changes which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are
signing.  These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001
and the left over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America
Corp.'s address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment
Document and have it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the
fax numbers for each party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is
(713)646-3490.

Everyone;

Attached is a revised assignment agreement which we hope you will find
satisfactory.

Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and

Steve, 
 I concur with your assessment of the proper method of so transferring the 
documents.


To: Dan J Hyvl/HOU/ECT@ECT

Subject: Re: Bammel Gas Trust Assignment  

Dan,


I think that given that there was a transfer of gas balances on the books 
from HPLR to ECT on 2/1/99, we need to show the transfer of the Operative 
Agreement rights and obligations to ECT first.  We can use the very same form 
to effect a transfer of ECT's interest on to HPL  effective July 1, 1999, 
with an acknowledgment of gas balances Schedule that will reflect the changes 
in each parties balance on July 1, 1999.  I know its more work, but I want it 
to track reality for when we face any investor/bank inquiries.  Let me know 
if your thoughts differ.

Steve

Lauri,   From a legal standpoint, we can cut the nomination on an 
interruptible agreement at our discretion.  The contract clearly gives us 
this right.  I haven't specifically reviewed the contract, but I am assuming 
it is our standard form.  I will check this.

Yes, I would consider HISD facilities to be state facilities.  The fact that 
this goes to Entex first complicates the issue.  

Dan,  was the intent that it be directly delivered to state facilities, or if 
it ultimately ended up at state facilities?

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus 
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into 
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.

Bruce/Dan , my only comment on th AOS contract is that Enron needs a ROFR on 
any volumes post 9:00 AM.  If Enron does not want the gas then, Keyspan  / BP 
has the right to market the gas to any other counter party.


Cheers,

Grant

Grant, just to follow up on a few issues:

1) I talked to Dan last Thursday and he stated he was going to follow up
with you on the wording below.
2) I still have not seen a transaction confirmation regarding our St.Claire
deal
3) Have you had a chance to look at numbers regarding our
Alliance/Malin/St. Claire conversation

Please let me know where we are at with the above issues

Dan, after talking to Mike Kleiner from Gulf and Grant Oh we determined the
wording in the contract handcuffs Crestar to move volumes after 9:00am MST
if additional volumes become available that Crestar did not have prior to
9:00am MST. Mike came up with the wording below to give Crestar the option
to move gas after 9:00am.

Please review and if you are in agreement please make the change to the
subject agreement.

Thanks,

RE: Transaction No. 1a; March 22, 2001

We are writing to obtain your waiver of certain requirements under the
subject agreement.

The specific circumstance of concern arises where, prior to 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day, CEMC advises Enron that it will not deliver gas or will
deliver less than the maximum DCQ, because CEMC does not expect to have
sufficient volumes available on the next Gas Day to enable it to utilize
all
of Customer's AOS.  Should circumstances change after 9:00 am on a
Nomination Day such that CEMC expects to have additional volumes available
on the next Gas Day, CEMC wishes to be authorized to utilize Customer's AOS
to deliver those additional volumes.

If you agree to allow CEMC to deliver volumes in the circumstance outlined
above, we request that you confirm your agreement on the duplicate copy of
this letter provided for that purpose.

Wes - I spoke with Barbara Gray in Legal last night.  Unless Entex consents, 
the Entex contract can only be assigned to an Enron affiliate.  However, 
Barbara thinks we can assign this contract (plus any other on-system ENA 
sales contracts) to an Enron affiliate, then sell this affiliate along with 
HPL stock to the buyer.  Barbara or Dan, if there are major impediments to 
this strategy, please let me know.

regards,
Patrick

DAN - I've made a few modifications to the above referenced agreement to 
reflect volume changes and pricing changes associated with the GRE deal.  The 
deal structure has been modified to reflect an increase in the DCQ, a  $0.05 
demand charge per DCQ and the ability for GRE to decrease its DCQ monthly.   
Could you please review the changes I made, as well as clarify that the 
respective pricing reflects gas purchased "day-ahead", not intraday.  
Intraday gas sells will be negotiated/ quoted on an "as needed" basis.  

What does not appear to be addressed in any of the contracts to be executed 
by ENA and GRE is the agency relationship that will exist whereby ENA will 
handle nominations, scheduling, invoicing , etc... The intent of our overall 
arrangement with GRE is to provide an agency relationship pursuant to the 
June 1, 2000 TRANSACTION TERM SHEET.  Is this agency arrangement going to be 
documented separately?  If so, please prepare a draft.  Otherwise, please 
incorporate into the below agreement language consistent with the June 1st 
Transaction Term Sheet under the section entitled "OPERATIONS".  



OSCAR - I've modified the agreement to reflect IF-FOM at Ventura for the DCQ 
and GDA-Common High for all volumes in excess of the DCQ.  Also, as you note 
above, I'm instructing Dan to clarify that this is day ahead gas.  Carl, in 
his June 23rd term sheet broke out the pricing mechanism to include a "day 
of" price.  I don't think we should show a price for intraday gas in the 
Winter.  It will be overly expensive and probably will never be utilized.  
Also, Carl raises the issue of utilizing third parties when ENA cannot 
service their account (blancing services, etc...)  Conceptually, I am 
indifferent, but if they don't use us than we don't nominate or schedule.

Subject: Glencore Fuel Supply Agreement

Doug Leach advised that he spoke with Sergio at Glencore yesterday, and 
Glencore is satisfied with the June 5 draft (copy attached) of the FSA, with 
the exception of 2 matters:
1.  He wants the LIBOR rate on late payments in Section 9.3 to be fixed on a 
specific day (e.g., the due date for the payment)
2.  He wants the ENE payment guarantee referenced in Section 9.5 to be 
increased to $7MM due to increased fuel prices.  
Doug is running these two points by Tom Moran on Monday, but doesn't believe 
they will be a problem (with respect to ENE furnishing the guarantee).

I intend to courier execution copies of the FSA to Glencore on Monday, after 
we get the confirmation from Tom Moran, unless any of you notify me of a 
problem with 
these changes.  
Regards,
Diana

Help, Time Warner is my cable service provider, however, when I attempted to 
open the ordering information, I am told that a discount for TimeWarner cable 
modern service is not available in my area.  What do I need to do?  So far as 
I know, I can subscribe to cable modem service with TimeWarner, however, I 
have been waiting until the ClickAtHome rollout before I committed to any 
service contract.  Can someone get back to me regarding when the discounted 
service might be available, if not, what is the possibility for a discounted 
DSL service from ATT.  Thank you.

Barbara & Anne,
 I spoke with Joe Defner this morning and  he reconfirmed that we only needed 
to provide him with a list of the ENA contracts that were being transferred 
to HPL or Newco.  If any of these contracts are involved in a monetization, 
the preferred solution would be for Enron Corp. to indemnify the lender for 
the lost of any revenues attributable to such contract.  Therefore, 
transferring ENA contracts to HPL or Newco should not be an issue, however, 
Joe would like as much up front notice as possible.

   Health Tips and News
   The Straight Dope On Food, Health, & Exercise:

   Q:  I've heard that cardiovascular exercise can prolong life. Is this
 true?
   A:  Your heart is only good for so many beats, and that's it. Everything
  wears out eventually. Speeding up your heart will not make you live
 longer;
  that's like saying you can extend the life of your car by driving it
  faster.  Want to live longer? Take a nap.

   Q: Should I cut down on meat and eat more fruits and vegetables?
   A: You must grasp logistical efficiencies. What does a cow eat? Hay and
  corn. And what are these? Vegetables. So a steak is nothing more than an
  efficient mechanism of delivering vegetables to your system. Need grain?
  Eat chicken. Beef is also a good source of field grass (green leafy
  vegetable). And a pork chop can give you 100% of your recommended daily
  allowance of vegetable slop.

   Q: Is beer or wine bad for me?
   A: Look, it goes to the earlier point about fruits and vegetables. As we
  all know, scientists divide everything in the world into three categories=
:
  animal, mineral, and vegetable. We all know that beer and wine are not
  animal, and they are not on the periodic table of elements, so that only
  leaves one thing, right? My advice: Have a burger and a beer and enjoy
 your
  liquid vegetables.

   Q: How can I calculate my body/fat ratio?
   A: Well, if you have a body, and you have body fat, your ratio is one to
  one. If you have two bodies, your ratio is two to one, etc.

    Q: At the gym, a guy asked me to "spot" for him while he did the bench
  press. What did he mean?
   A: "Spotting" for someone means you stand over him while he blows air up
  your shorts. It's an accepted practice at health clubs; though if you fin=
d
  that it becomes the ONLY reason why you're going in, you probably ought t=
o
  reevaluate your exercise program.

   Q: What are some of the advantages of participating in a regular exercis=
e
  program?
   A: Can't think of a single one, sorry.  My philosophy is: No Pain-No
 Pain.

   Q: If I stop drinking, will I live longer?
   A: Nope. Drinking enhances individual expression and peace of mind. If
  you stop, you'll probably stress yourself to death in record time.

   Q: Aren't fried foods bad for you?
   A: You're not listening. Foods are fried these days in vegetable oil. In
  fact, they're permeated in it. How could getting more vegetables be
 bad for
  you?

   Q: What's the secret to healthy eating?
   A: Thicker gravy.

   Q: Will sit-ups help prevent me from getting a little soft around the
  middle?
   A: Definitely not! When you exercise a muscle, it gets bigger. You shoul=
d
  only be doing sit-ups if you want a bigger stomach.

  I hope this has cleared up any misconceptions you may have had.

Robin,
 At Jeff's request, I have reviewed the attached form which National Fuel 
provided.  It is not designed to operate as a Trading Contract.  Transactions 
are only formed by signing an Exhibit A to be prepared by National.  The 
Exhibit A is to have a Daily Transaction Quantity and National may nominate 
from 0 to 100% of that quantity each day.  Penalties only arise if the actual 
quantity deviates from their nominated quantity.  Seller to pay difference 
between Buyer's replacement price and the Gas Commodity Charge times the 
deficiency quantity.  Buyer to pay difference between the Gas Commodity 
Charge and the Daily Midpoint Price times the deficiency quantity.   Does not 
state what quantity is to be applied against the Gas Demand Charge; however, 
does state that if Seller has a force majeure the Gas Demand Charge is only 
applied against the actual volumes that Seller delivers and that the Gas 
Demand Charge is not reduced if Buyer declares a Force Majeure.  Buyer's 
payments are to be trued up to the actual quantities delivered should actuals 
deviate from the nominated quantities.  
 Please note the comments I provided to you last year relating to this 
counterparty.  All of those comments are applicable to this Contract form.  I 
have attached that memo for your review.

 
Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this matter.

John, 
 You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
back to me.

Charles,
 Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
was to redo the termination payment amount.

Attached below is the Credit Worksheet for a Master Physical Agreement to be 
entered into by and between Houston Pipe Line Company and Dynegy Marketing 
and Trade that the Counterparty has requested.   As explained in the 
worksheet comments section, both entities already have Guaranties.  However, 
Enron must add Houston Pipe Line Company as an additional "Buyer" in the 
Guaranty in place now (amount of $15MM, open expiry).  HPL is already 
included in the Gty issued by Dynegy.

Please give me a call if you have any questions on the worksheet.



Thanks,

Veronica Espinoza

Lee,
 Please review the attached GTC confirm to see if this is what you want.  I 
talked to Darren Vanek about this last evening and he had no problem in 
structuring the transaction in this manner.

		 Subject: Roche Vitamins, Inc. - Freeport

I am working with Roche Vitamins, who are trying to trigger a fixed price for 
the remaining term of their HPL contract, from June01 to Feb02.  They want to 
trigger a fixed price for about 400 MMBtu/d.

Rudwell - we discussed a collateral threshold of $100,000 with this entity, 
based on the limited information that we have received from this privately 
held company.  I assume this is still correct?

Dan - could you send me some draft language that we would insert into the HPL 
contract for the collateral threshold matter???  It is a typical HPL physical 
contract (HPL already has the right to request payment securities for good 
cause) - if you don't already have a copy of the contract, let me know and 
I'll fax it to you.

Roche want to review the language and get it approved internally before doing 
anything.

Thanks

Lee

Mike,
 I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement and 
have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best efforts" 
which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read "commercially 
reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the same throughout the 
document where we use the term "commercially reasonable best efforts".  With 
this change, please print out two copies of the contract and two copies of 
the transaction agreement and proceed with execution of each.  Please call if 
you have any questions.

Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to

Thanks for the update. The cancelllation notice is important because Enron 
Fuels International then has to cancel their supply agreement with Nicor. 
HMPC stills owes EFI $68,695.76 for fuel related invoices. Whom should we 
direct the final billing to?

HMPC has NOT been sold.  Sale is pending subject to final payment from 
HEPCO.  At such time as poayment is received and the sale consummated, we

If in fact the plant has been sold it is even more important that we receive 
formal notice from HMPC regarding the cancellation of the fuel supply 
agreement. Who handled the sale of HMPC's assets?

Doug,

I feel we should arrange to cancel the contract formally for good records.  

All the people I knew in HMPC have already left the company.  Understand the 
plant been sold!!

Nicor Petroleum - been re-organized, all the personnel who was involved in 
the fuel contract have also left the company.  

I will also be leaving Enron at the end of the year for retirement.

Enron Fuels International (EFI) has a long term gasoil supply agreement with 
HMPC which has not been used for several years. What is the current and 
future status of the plant? If the plant is not going to operate and not need 
liquid fuel deliveries, then I need someone within HMPC to send a formal 
notice to EFI cancelling the fuel supply contract. We have requested this 
several times over the past few years to no avail.

George,

Sorry for the delay but I was in a meetings during the day due to the coming 
PQP Board Meeting.

I am complete agree with your recommendation. For us it is better if you can 
issue an invoice for the correct amount for the January delivery and on 
another line show the credit for the December delivery.

This is better and more clear way to do this.

Just to be complete clear and understood, we also cannot be a party to any 
action that may be construed as circumventing the taxing authorities. What I 
wrote in my previous e-mail was the way that we were invoiced in the past in 
similar situation.

Regards, Carlos

Subject: Re: Esmeraldas pricing calculation  

AFTER DISCUSSIONS WITH DOUG LEACH AND  ENRON'S LEGAL
AND TAX DEPARTMENT'S  WE HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION 
THAT WE CANNOT ISSUE AN INVOICE OUTSIDE THE CONTRACT
 TERMS.

WE ISSUED A PRELIMINARY INVOICE FOR THE DECEMBER DELIVERY
AND FOLLOWED UP WITH AN ADJUSTMENT IN JANUARY. THIS INVOICING
WAS AT YOUR REQUEST AND FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE. WE ASSUMED YOU 
HAD TAKEN ALL THE RAMIFICATION OF YOUR REQUEST INTO CONSIDERATION.

WE CANNOT BE A PARTY TO ANY ACTION THAT MAY BE CONSTRUED AS
CIRCUMVENTING THE TAXING  AUTHORITIES.

HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ASKING FOR A REFUND OF VAT. BY THE WAY
HOW MUCH VAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. MY EXPERIENCE IS VAT IS
NORMALLY 15-18 %. THAT WOULD BE ONLY  $750-900. A LOT OF TIME
HAS BEEN SPENT A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY.

WE CAN ISSUE AN INVOICE FOR THE CORRECT AMOUNT FOR THE JANUARY
DELIVERY AND ON ANOTHER LINE SHOW THE CREDIT FOR THE DECEMBER 
DELIVERY, BUT UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES CAN WE ADJUST THE JANUARY
SALES PRICE. PLEASE CONFIRM  YOU WOULD PREFER THIS METHOD.

BEST REGARDS.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

 Please review the attached amendment to see if it sets forth your 
understanding of the pricing to be applicable with regard to the first 
volumes to be delivered during the July - June time period.  I assume you 
want the prices to revert to Index after this period.  Please advise, If

Attached is new draft with alternative language for Transportation Capacity 
Credit section.  Enron MW trading is not comfortable with the Gas Daily 
posting as the value determinant.  We would prefer to base the value on 
actual transactions (I believe PGL already has audit rights).

Dan, Keyspan / Gulf  bought out Crestar - Crestar holds the Alliance 
capacity.  BP is taking assignment of only a portion the volume of the 
contract with Enron.   

Dan, can you call Bruce Kohrs @ Keyspan for final clarification and 
confirmation.  403-205-7684

Thanks

 Question?  What is Gulf doing in these transactions.  Is it in place of 
Crestar or BP or what?  Who can answer?

Joan,
 Attached is the Letter Agreement for St. Mary's Production LLC.  According 
to Charlie, St. Mary's production is being delivered at the same points as is 
the Hunt Southern Louisiana production.  Therefore, the St. Mary's letter is 
identical to the Hunt letter which Charlie is sending to Hunt today.  If this 
is not the case, please let me know and I will modify to fit the terms of the 
St. Mary's deal.  Otherwise, please print off as many originals as you need 
and send them to St. Mary's for their execution and return.  Please call if 
you have any questions.

Subject: Petrogulf

Sorry, I forgot one last point that Bill Whitaker (Petrogulf) mentioned to me 
last nite.  Bear Paw is gathering +/-4,000 mcf/d from Petrogulf's wellhead 
into Fort Union.  Since Bear Paw does not buy gas nor has capacity on Ft. 
Union, Petrogulf would like us to include this gas under the MDQ and purchase 
(or gather) this volume under these agreements.  I guess we could just 
identify this receipt point separately on an exhibit and attach a lower 
gathering fee (i.e. $0.145/mcf to cover Ft. Union capacity).  

I hope this made sense.....Thx.

Subject: Petrogulf

Attached is a draft term sheet for Petrogulf.  Bill Whitaker has not seen 
this letter yet, however it reflects verbal discussions we have had regarding 
terms of a potential deal.  In the interest of time and to be proactive, I 
would like to send Petrogulf a draft contract with these terms included ASAP 
for their review.  This acreage is adjacent to MTG, so its very competitive.  
Additionally, Petrogulf plans to have +/-100 wells drilled by year-end, so 
could be a lot of early gas coming our way!

Thanks.

Dan

Paul,
 You say 5,000/day plus fuel.  The delivery point is in the south texas 
pool.  Where does the fuel come in and how is it determined?  Also, did we 
ever determine the name of the Reliant Energy entity that was doing the deal?

Attached are the details for the enovate transaction(s)/purchases of physical 
gas from Reliant @ Trunkline Stx pool.  I received your draft of the agreed 
Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day 
parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the 
Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement 
past our partners PEC legals folks.

Thanks,

If you have any questions please call me at (312) 541-1226

No, I did not get a call from Jessica.  Therefore, I do not know if this got 
resolved or not.  Did Jessica know anything about someone nominating gas at 
Pip 3152 on NGPL and if so, had they resolved the issues with Falesc Oil 
Company.  The attorney name was Greg Bandelee, spelling unknown, at (217) 
234-4204.

I just wanted to make sure that you got your problem resolved last Friday.  
Jessica White, who schedules NGPL, should have given you a call.  I meant to 
call and check that afternoon to make sure, but got busy on something.  If 
you would just respond to this email letting me know if everything is 
resolved, that would be great.

Thanks,

Steve

Russell,
 I have no problems with their few editing word changes other than we need to 
have a separate guaranty for the HPL contract.  However, until they sign the 
master, their is no need to do anything because this is the identical 
guaranty that you currently have from coastal.

Dan,

I have forwarded you the Guaranty from Coastal.  This Guaranty is a redline 
version that Coastal has provided comments on.  At this time they do not want 
to negotiate the Master Agreement until they fully understand how their 
current positions will fit into El Paso's trading book with the upcoming 
merger.  Please review the attached Guaranty and provide your comments.  The 
contact ar Coastal is Dai Nguyen, her phone number is 713-418-4229.

Thank you,

Russell

I haven't heard anything back from you guys on this.  Any insight?  I know 
Linda Roberts is also working a deal with TGLO to convert bbls to mmbtus 
which could mean incremental volumes that TGLO would be trying to get into 
Midcon.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Kim,
 I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing 
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I 
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron 
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you 
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact 
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been 
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be. 
 If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution 
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC.  
 Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy 
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.

Veronica, I had received a previous e-mail today from Russell attaching a 
form of this guarantee that was slightly different from the one attached 
below.  I like the version you have attached to this e-mail better than the 
one Russell sent (and that's not just because Russell sent it, although that 
would be reason enough).  I have no comments on the form attached to this 
e-mail but would have a few if the form is the one Russell sent out.

Let me know.

Cheers
Greg

Dan and Greg,

Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.

Thanks--

Veronica

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Teresa,
 I think that the problem is what is meant by "these costs".  Currently we 
think that it will be negative, but until we get the allocations, we won't 
know.  That is the reason we want to go monthly.  Is there a problem getting 
them to sign something if we need to do it for another month.  The terms may 
be different with regard to next months deal.  Please advise.

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

Sunday really was good. We had a really good time also. I think Mom enjoyed
it also. Getting together for Mom's birthday sounds great to me Only have
one suggestion. Tell Mom that we are taking her out for her birthday or else
she will try to cook everthing. Then we can all show up with the food.
I don't know what to say about how she would feel about losing control of
her checking account. Some days she seems really concerned about what she
has in the bank and other times she handles things well. She did give Buddy
a signed blank check to go pay for fertilizer on a Sat. and then when he
went to pay for it on Mom. evening she had already gone in and paid for it
herself that morning. She had forgotten she had told him to do it.She still
thinks she will be put in a nursing home if she forgets things. She told us
again Sunday that they put Aunt Minnie in a nursing home because she forgot
the stove on. Though i'm sure it was more to it than that. I'm open to
suggestions.

A jeweler watched as a huge truck pulled up in front of his store. The back 
came down and an elephant walked out. It broke one of the windows with its 
tusk and then, using its trunk like
a vacuum cleaner sucked up all of the jewelry. The elephant then got back in 
the truck and it disappeared out of sight.

When the jeweler finally regained his senses he called the police. The 
detectives came and he told them his story.

"Could you describe the elephant?" the cop asked.

"An elephant is an elephant," he replied. "You've seen one you've seen them 
all. What do you mean 'describe' him?"

"Well," said the policeman, "there are two types of elephants, African and 
Indian. The Indian elephant has smaller ears and is not as large as the 
African elephant."

"I can't help you out," said the frustrated jeweler, "he had a stocking 
pulled over his head."

Please see the attached which (I think) describes the improvements in Section 
16 of the Quantum deal.

In my (non-legal) opinion, if we include this document with the scematic of 
the collection facilities in Exhibit B or C of the Purchase/Gath documents, 
then will this suffice for Exhibit B of the Mortgage Agreement?

Thanks.

Clement,

As a follow up to Veronica's e-mal to you a few days ago regarding the review 
of this guaranty, can you please let me know the status of your review.  
Please make note, the redline version attached below (enronredline112900.doc) 
was originally drafted by Dan and yourself as an attachment to an Enfolio 
Master agreement.  We are anxious to exchange guaranty's to cover exposure in 
this volatile price market.

Thank you,

Clement,

Attached below are Coastal's (formerly Engage Energy US) comments to our 
outgoing gty format.  The ISDA was recently amended due to Guarantor changes 
on their end, so now gty's are also being negotiated.  Please review their 
comments and forward either me or Russell your comments to forward on to 
Coastal.

Thanks again Clement,

Veronica

As  discussed, I am forwarding my recent email to Russell Diamond on the

?Russell,

Please find attached  a revised redline Guaranty which incorporates changes 
to Enron's standard  format.? In addition, we request??the following 
important  changes:
?
(1)???The proposed Guaranty?shouldcover all Obligations and not be  Contract 
specific.? Therefore the language in the second paragraph  beginning with the 
word 'WHEREAS' needs to be suitably amended by your Attorney  to reflect that 
all Obligations??of the  Obligors?are covered and?the 
Guaranty??obligations?are not tied to specific  contracts.
?
(2)? Under  Section 2, titled 'MAXIMUM LIMIT',?the Maximum Limit?should notbe 
capped for each entity at a  specific amount.Conversely, the limit on  
the?Guaranty?shouldbe a  'Unified Maximum'.??Please request your attorney to 
make suitable  language changes for this change as well.
?
Please send me a  revised redline earliest convenient for our review.

As requested  by you, I am resending the draft for the proposed Coastal

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

Our department will be migrated to Outlook in two groups.  The first group 
will be migrated on Monday, June 11,  and the second group will be migrated 
on Tuesday, June 12.   You will receive four e-mails from the Outlook 
migration team.  Please do not delete them.  You will need to open the four 
e-mails and follow the instructions to migrate to Outlook.

Assistants, you will be responsible for scheduling training for yourself and 
your assignments.  It is recommended everyone attend a one hour training 
class.  Training can be scheduled by contacting Maggie Cruz at extension 
3-1816.  (Assistants, please coordinate training with your backup so both of 
you are not in training at the same time.)  Outlook migration specialists 
will be on the 38th floor to answer questions Tuesday and Wednesday, June 12 
and 13.

Listed below is useful information provided to us by the Outlook Migration 
team.  

E-mail Policies

Users will be restricted to a Mailbox size of 100 MB.  

Further mailbox size restrictions are detailed as follows:

Issue Warning at 75 MB - users are automatically sent a warning from the 
System Administrator explaining they are near their Mailbox limit.

Prohibit Send at 100 MB - users are prevented from sending e-mail, yet they 
can still receive internal and external messages.  Users must reduce the size 
of their mailbox by deleting old mail, saving attachments to a local drive, 
etc. before they can send e-mail again.   

Inbound/Outbound Mail Size Limits - inbound and outbound e-mail messages will 
be limited to a size of 10MB.

Deleted Item Retention - users will be able to recover deleted items from 
their mailbox as old as 8 days.  Deleted items include e-mail messages, 
folders, contacts, calendar entries, tasks, notes, journal entries and 
meeting notices.

Archiving - archiving will not be a supported feature of Outlook 2000. 

Migration Preparation

Clean Your Mailbox - due to new space limitations on your mailbox, you are 
advised to clean your Notes mailbox of old, unneeded messages BEFORE 
migration.  If you are at the 100MB limit on the day of migration, you will 
not be able to send messages once you are in Outlook.

Limits on Items Migrated  - from the day of your migration, only 30 days of 
old mail will be migrated from your mailbox.  This includes mail in your 
inbox and other folders.  Calendar items dating back one year from the day of 
migration will be migrated (with the exception of repeating appointments).

Dan,

Today, I entered into some conversations with the City of Palo Alto regarding 
fixing forward gas prices for them.  They have a copy of a Master agreement 
and a copy of an ISDA which are currently in their legal department.  They 
have requested a copy of the GTC language which would allow us to transact in 
the immediate future, although I am still pushing for a Master.  They 
currently have a Power Master in place with EPMI.  

Could you forward a copy of the General Terms and Conditions to Monica 
Padilla with the City of Palo Alto at Monica_Padilla@city.palo-alto.ca.us 
first thing in the morning?  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
issues.

Thanks,

Kim Ward

A payment test file was sent to the bank in error and, as a result, a deposit 
was posted on Monday, July 10, 2000.  This impacts only employees who utilize 
direct deposits (ACH) and are paid semi-monthly.

To correct this situation, on Tuesday, July 11, 2000 a withdrawal of the 
amount deposited will be processed.  Your bank may not post this transaction 
until Wednesday, July 12, 2000.

If you have any questions, please call (713) 345-5555.  We apologize for any 
inconvenience.

Frank, 

Both of the suggested changes are both reasonable and necessary from both a 
legal and tax viewpoint due to the long term nature and possible change of 
ownership or control of the project in the future. Call me to discuss if you 
wish.

Subject: Nicaragua Fuel Supply Arrangement - Option Agreement

This is to confirm our conversation relating to the Option Agreement.  If EFI 
is to sign, I believe that the following changes need to be made.
 1.  The last sentence of paragraph No. 2 should be deleted.  The agreements 
provide that EFI has the right to assign to an affiliate without EI's 
consent.  EFI needs to maintain its right to so assign during the term of the 
agreements.
 2  Paragraph No. 3 needs to be modified by adding the words "as reasonably" 
before requested in the third line thereof; and deleting the word "not" in 
the fifth line thereof.  Additionally, the last sentence needs to be deleted, 
because the indemnity agreement needs to remain in effect for so long as EFI 
is requested to perform any services under those agreements.

Please call if these requested changes present any problems.

Arthur Davidson, of the Harley Davidson Motorcycle Corporation, died and
went to heaven.  At the gates, St.  Peter told Arthur, "Since you've
such a good man and your motorcycles have changed the world, your reward is,
you can hang out with anyone you want in Heaven." Arthur thought about it
for a minute and then said, "I want to hang out with God." St.  Peter took 
Arthur to the Throne Room, and introduced him to God.  Arthur then asked God, 
"Hey,aren't you the inventor of woman?" God said, "Ah, yes." "Well," said 
Arthur,"professional to professional, you have some major design flaws in 
your invention. 
1.  There's too much inconsistency in the front-end protrusion. 
2.  It chatters constantly at high speeds. 
3.  Most of the rear ends are too soft and wobble too much. 
4.  The intake is placed way to close to the exhaust.  And finally, 
5.  The maintenance costs are outrageous." 
"Hmmmm, you may have some good points there," replied God, "hold on." God 
went to his Celestial super computer, typed in a few words and waited for the 
results.  The computer printed out a slip of paper and God read it.  "Well, 
it may be true that my invention is flawed," God said to Arthur, "but 
according to these numbers,more men are riding my invention than yours."

Richard,
 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.  
Thank you.

I was a salesman back home in Texas."
	
	Well, the boss liked the kid so he gave him the job.  "You can start 
tomorrow.  I'll come down after we close and see how you did."?
	
	His first day on the job was rough, but he got through it.  After the store 
was locked up, the boss came down.
	
	"How many sales did you make today?"  the boss asked.?
	
	The kid says, "One."?
	
	The boss says, "Just one?  Our sales people average 20 to 30 sales a day.?
	
	How much was the sale for?"
	
	The kid says, $101,237.64."
	
	The boss says, $101,237.64?  What the hell did you sell?"
	
	The kid says, "First I sold him a small fish hook.  Then I sold him a medium 
fish hook.  Then I sold him a larger fish hook.  Then I sold him a new 
fishing rod.  Then I asked him where he was going fishing and he said down 
the coast, so I told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the 
boat department and I sold him that twin engine Chris Craft.  Then he said he 
didn't think his Honda Civic would pull it, so I took him down to the 
automotive department and sold him that 4 x 4 Blazer."
	
	The boss said, "A guy came in here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat 
and truck?"
	
	The kid says, "No, he came in here to buy a box of tampons for his wife and I 
said, "Well, your weekend's shot -- you might as well go fishing."

Bridgette,
 I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was 
with the canadian el paso entity.

Dan,

I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.

Bob -

Thanks for the information and access id's. 

As I indicated in my voice mail earlier today, the standard process is to run 
these deals through one central point and to ensure that a review of all 
descriptions and information related to each respective product to be traded 
is undertaken by a Legal Dept. member.   As you will note from the list of 
cc's, I have included legal dept. members involved in the physical power, 
physical gas and financial products areas.  These people will need to review 
the product definitions/descriptions - if any - on the Tradequote site, as 
well as any other items associated with these products.  Accordingly, each of 
these individuals also needs a password/user id for due diligence purposes.

I have almost completed my review of the Access Agreement and the other 
documents on the site (available without a password).  I can complete the 
review process only after Brent, Dan and Shari have completed their on-line 
product reviews and provided any comments.

We can further discuss this at 3:30.

Chris has probably already forwarded contract number SES0010  to your

(SES0010) was created and forwarded to Chris, Smurfit-Stone has  made several 
minor revisions to their standard contract.? Therefore, I have  attached a 
revised version for your review (SES0020).? I look forward to  hearing back 
from you in the very near future.? Once?I have received  the okay from you, I 
will forward?two original copies?in the mail for  signature.? Thank you for

agreement?  Is this something that Stacy Dickson prepared for you?  If so, 
please attach a copy for my review.

Dan, I will not be sending this document to Crestar.  Raise this confirm 
directly with Crestar in the final state and send  to them.  Assuming they 
have no problem with the paper.... we should be done on the monthly firm deal.

Can you send down the paper on the AOS daily balancing agreement. This is a 
seperate agreement that is secondary to the firm deal.

Thanks.

I have been told by Kim and Dan that the City is currently not authorized to

In terms of negotiation of the ISDA, we sent out a draft to them a few weeks

Debra:

As Debra and I discussed, we are  currently preparing a GISB contract for GPU 
Services Company, as agent for ______.  I mentioned to Debra that when we 
have a counterparty who is represented in transactions by an agent, we  work 
to include the attached agency riders in the master agreement.  These riders 
include reps and warranties relating to the agent's authority as well as an 
acknowledgment by the principal relating to same.  I propose that you all 
consider the attached riders when preparing master agreements in an agency 
context.  

To the extent that the counterparty is amenable, I strongly urge you to 
propose that the principal enter into the contract on its own behalf and that 
the contract merely recite that the agent is authorized to enter into 
transactions pursuant to the agreement for and on behalf of the principal.  
This is the approach I am going to try with GPU.  If an agent represents 
multiple principals, try to enter into a separate master with each principal. 

However, to the extent the counterparty absolutely refuses this approach, at 
the very least I would include the riders and get acknowledgments from the 
principal(s).  If there are multiple principals, try to get a separate 
agreement with the agent for each principal (as opposed to one master with an 
agent on behalf of numerous principals) to avoid questions about allocation 
of transactions and credit exposures.

Please feel free to follow up with any questions or comments.

I have also attached for your reference a memorandum I prepared some time ago

Blanca,
 I believe that you will need to get this form approved by the legal group in 
Columbus before it is signed.  It is my understanding that Pemex has agreed 
to New York law in the past.  I would not approve it unless they agreed to 
New York law and arbitration conducted in English.  If you need a quick 
turnaround, please check with Gary Prescott.

Dan,

I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last
year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to
convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of "general
terms and conditions" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a
Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the
replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract
quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion
of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase
Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3)
the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain "Master
Contract" and "Transaction Confirmation".  These changes necessarily lead to
more definitions.

In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is
almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any
changes you might like to make to our language.

The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to
negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the
removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2
items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the
addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment
Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties
had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract
had passed.

For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim.
However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to
last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting
last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an
executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding
process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with
all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is
expected to take place in early April.

I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need
to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be
checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

Thanks for your help Dan.

Kim,
     I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If
we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the
version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for
this years volume and price.  What is your preference?

Kim,
 Stacy (Dickson) Granmayeh has reviewed the proposed Master Contract that y=
ou=20
drafted for enovate, L.L.C. and I have likewise reviewed the proposed Maste=
r=20
Contract that you forwarded to Enron North America Corp.

 As I indicated earlier, these contracts are similar to the contract we=20
started with last year in documenting the transaction that was ultimately=
=20
entered into.  I recall providing a copy of our Sample Enfolio Master Firm=
=20
Purchase/Sale Agreement together with the credit departments requirements=
=20
which they required in order to enter into the transaction.  I am told that=
=20
those credit requirements relating to triggering events and collateral=20
threshold will also be necessary before Enron North America Corp. can enter=
=20
into a transaction this year.

 Unless I specifically state that a comment relates to enovate or to Enron,=
=20
these comments relate to both entities.

 1. The correct name for enovate is:  enovate, L.L.C.

 2. Change the Confirming Party in Section 3.12 to Seller.

 3. Section 4.1 needs to be altered in such a way to make the verbal=20
agreement of the Parties binding at the time of the phone call.  As written=
,=20
any agreement between the Parties is not binding until a Transaction=20
Confirmation is executed by both Parties.

 4. The word "Contract" in Section 5.1.1.b. should be changed to=20
"Transaction".

 5. The concept of "Point(s) of Receipt" and "Point(s) of Sale" need to be=
=20
collapsed into Point(s) of Delivery at which point title and possession is=
=20
transferred from the Seller to the Buyer. No need for two separate concepts=
.

 6. Delete Sections 6.5 and 6.6 in their entireties.

 7. Alter Section 8.3.3 concerning Locked Prices in such a way to make the=
=20
Locked Prices binding at the time of the phone call; not upon the passage o=
f=20
48 hours for receipt of confirmation.

 8. The term "Commodity Charge Index Adjustment" used in Section 8.1, 8.2 a=
nd=20
8.3 needs to be defined.

 9. The first sentence of Section 10.3 should be altered to delete the last=
=20
phrase =01&of the negligence of the other Party=018 and include the followi=
ng=20
phrase in its place:  =01&the gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad f=
aith=20
of the other Party.=018
=20
 10. Delete the phrase =01&(not via facsimile)=018 from the first sentence =
of=20
Section 12.1.

 11. Add the following phrase at the end of Section 15.3: =01&; the loss of=
=20
Buyer=01,s Markets; or Buyer=01,s inability economically to use or resell g=
as=20
purchased hereunder.=018

 12. Delete the phrase =01&or Buyer or Seller claims force majeure for a pe=
riod=20
exceeding seven (7) cumulative days or five (5) consecutive days during the=
=20
Transaction Term=018 in Section 16.1.b.

 13. Add the following sentence to the end of Section 16.1.e:  =01&Party fa=
ils=20
to perform any covenant set forth in this Contract.=018

 14. Delete the third sentence of Section 16.2 in its entirety.

 15. Delete Section 16.3.d in its entirety.

 16. The Corporate Guarantee in Section 19 should be a payment guarantee no=
t=20
a performance guarantee.

 17. With regard to enovate, change =01&Wisconsin=018 to =01&Illinois=018 i=
n Section=20
21.5; and with regard to Enron, change "Wisconsin" to "Texas" in Section 21=
.5.

 18. Section 21.7 requires =01&mutual execution of an appropriate supplemen=
tal=20
written Transaction Confirmation=018 for an effective modification.  This=
=20
conflicts with Section 8.3.3, which does not require execution of a=20
Transaction Confirmation for a Locked Price.

 19. Delete Section 22.e in its entirety.

 20. In Exhibit A, delete Section 12, Regulatory Contingency, in its entire=
ty.

 Please review the foregoing and provide revised contracts to both enovate=
=20
and Enron for further review in accordance with the foregoing matters.

Dan and Dan,
The Colton group (John Anderson, Don Colton, Gregg Colton and Mike
Pinnell)owns 15% of the Bonepile lease through North American Petroleum, LC
(NAPLC).  The four individuals executed the JOA and participated in all
wells drilled thus far in their individual capacities.  However, title to
the underlying leasehold ownership is technically still in the name of North
American Petroleum, LC.  EOW has received specific authority from NAPLC in
the form of a Seller's Representative Agreement to enter into the Enron GPA,
GSA and the WHGGS Mortgage.

EOW will either need to execute all agreements as Seller's Rep for NAPLC or
EOW can execute a ratification of all agreements on behalf of NAPLC, its up
to Dan.

Doug

Subject: Re: ENA Texas Contracts

David,

You asked us to determine if, after the sale to AEP, ENA has enough contract 
coverage for its then-former HPL customers.  We have reviewed all contracts 
in either the HOUGAS or HPL Maintenance Groups of our Global Contracts 
Database, and as of 4/12/2001, we have determined the following:

1.  There are a total of 7,434 active contracts in the two Groups, 5,680 in 
the HOUGAS Group and 1,754 in the HPL Group.

2.  With some minor, inconsequential exceptions, the Enron counterparty for 
all contracts in the HOUSGAS Group is Enron North America Corp. and the Enron 
counterparty for all contracts in the HPL Group is either the Houston Pipe 
Line Company or HPL Resources Company.

3.  Of the 7,434 active contracts, a total of 2,056 contracts are Master 
Agreements - that is, they are generic in nature and can therefore capture 
deals at any point on the grid.  My category of Master Agreements includes, 
among others, the following:  all GISB contracts and  all Master Purchase 
and/or Sale contracts (both spot and firm).   My category of Master 
Agreements does NOT include the following:  Committed Reserves contracts, 
GTCs (General Terms and Conditions contracts, both spot and firm) or Single 
Transaction contracts - these contracts are always point specific.

4.  Of the 2,056 Master Agreements, 1,888 are in the HOUGAS Group (Enron 
North America Corp.) and 168 are in the HPL Group (Houston Pipe Line Company 
or HPL Resources Company.

5.  We have reviewed each of the 168 HPL Group Master Agreements and assigned 
one of four designators to each agreement as follows:

 a.  "going/need?" indicates the HPL contract is going to AEP - does ENA need 
a replacement for business after 6/1/2001

 b.  "going/staying" indicates the HPL contract is going to AEP but an 
identical contract already exists for ENA

 c.  "going" indicates the HPL contract is going to AEP but a similar 
contract already exists for ENA

 d.  "staying" corresponds to "going" on the ENA side - it's the similar 
contract that already exists for ENA

The "going"/"staying" designation can best be described by citing a specific 
example.  On the attachment, Boyd Rosene and Associates, Inc. is listed on 
lines 24 and 25.  The Master Purchase Sale Spot contract with HPL is going to 
AEP, but the GISB Base Contract is staying with ENA.  Technically, the 
contracts are somewhat different, but in general, the parties can conduct the 
same business under a Master Purchase Sale Spot contract as under a GISB Base 
Contract.  Thus, I would suggest that ENA needs to take no further action 
with respect to contracting with Boyd Rosene and Associates, Inc. as a result 
of the Master Purchase Sale Spot contract moving to AEP.

The attachment sets forth, in alphabetical order by counterparty, the 
counterparties associated with the 168 HPL Master Contracts and the 
corresponding ENA Master Contracts with those parties, if any.  The list is 
very counterparty specific.  For example, Exxon Mobil Corporation is not the 
same party as ExxonMobil Gas Marketing Company.  In all, we have identified a 
total of 116 HPL Master Contracts that may need to be replaced by ENA, those 
designated "going/need?"

This analysis does not cover those ENA contracts that will be going to AEP 
thru Lodisco, such as Reliant Energy - Entex.

David wants to determine if, after the sale to AEP, ENA has enough contract 
coverage for its then-former HPL customers.  We're going to provide, by 
tomorrow, a list of all the customers with Master or GISB contracts with ENA 
and HPL and then review same to see where the holes may be.  For example, if 
HPL has a GISB with, say Amoco, but none in place with ENA, then ENA could 
determine if they want to put one in place for future business.

  Rationale


    Debt reduction, cost cutting, and increased sales have brought El Paso=
=20
Electric Co. back toward
    investment-grade benchmarks. The company has exceeded debt-reduction=20
targets and expects debt to be
    about 50% of total capital by 2002. If sales continue to grow at even=
=20
one-half the historical 3% to 4% per year,
    cash flow interest coverage should improve to 3.5 times by then. Still,=

the ratings on El Paso Electric continue to
    reflect the company=01,s high leverage, dependence on nuclear power, hi=
gh=20

    The company borrowed heavily to fund its 15.8% interest in the Palo Ver=

    the utility=01,s power. The plant=01,s past operating problems and cont=

structural problems add some risk to the
    company=01,s already weak financial profile. Most importantly, customer=
s in=20
the generally low-income service
    territory fought against rate increases needed to recover the nuclear=
=20
investment, helping to put El Paso Electric
    in bankruptcy. A settlement signed with Texas customers in 1995 allowed=
=20
the company to keep a $25 million
    rate increase implemented in 1994, permitted accelerated depreciation o=
f=20
generation and transmission assets,
    and froze rates until 2005 in exchange for extending the El Paso Electr=
ic=20

    In 1998, the company agreed to reduce rates--mainly residential--in New=

    more in line with Southwestern averages. By the time retail competition=

    time, El Paso Electric will have separated its assets into a regulated=

    and an unregulated electricity generation business, as required by New=
=20
Mexico and Texas law. Costs incurred
    to effect this change will be recovered in a competitive transition=20
charge. Stranded costs (accrued charges
    related to generating plant costs which would have been recovered in a=

    a five-year transition period in New Mexico. In Texas, the rate=20

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Article II of the NONCOMPETITION AGREEMENT entered in connection with the 
sale of HPL to AEP (which closed as of June 1,2001) provides:

 "ENA [for 3 months post-close] will not  solicit, negotiate or enter into 
any contract, agreement or arrangement for the purchase of natural gas on the 
HPL Pipeline from any Person which is a supplier or producer of natural gas 
connected to the HPL Facilities; provided, however, nothing herein shall be 
construed or interpreted as prohibiting ENA from entering into any such 
contract, agreement or arrangement which is less than one month in duration 
and involves or is related to an Enron Online transaction." 

 This is not the most clearly drafted provision as it was the subject of much 
negotiation....and was significantly narrowed from the  original scope 
proposed by AEP.  Thus, please consult with me prior to entering into any 
solicitation, agreement or arrangement which might arguably be covered by our 
limited covenant not to compete on the supply side for 3 months.  There are 
many aspects of the post-close transition which will require cooperation 
between Enron and AEP/HPL and thus, it behoves us to carefully weigh the 
risks and rewards of "stepping too close to or over the line".

Further,although a technical reading of the non-competition agreement only 
applies to ENA, no ENA UPSTREAM deals which would violate this covenant if 
there were to be done as ENA should be done without clearance from Brian 
Redmond and me.

Please communicate this restriction to those who report to you and have need 
to be aware of this limited restriction.

Sincerely
 BNG

Barbara,
 This appears to be supply deal for deliveries at Katy that would be subject 
to the 90 day non-compete.  Sandi is in the process of getting me a copy of 
the non-compete so that I can determine if this deal is covered.  Do you have 
any thoughts.

Dan,

The agreement you sent me was not the final agreement signed by Westport. The 
one they signed - see attached - was a Field Services agreement, not a 
Gathering Services agreement.

I made the changes to the attached in Section 4.1. 
Let me know if you are ok with them.

Do we need to have the whole agreement signed or can the one page just be 
changed ?

Mike

Dan:  I have sent your modifications to Dave Anderson (Law) for review.

I will need to prepare two separate Enron agreements for final execution,
once we agree on terms. 1) Enron North America and 2) Enron Canada Corp.
Also, I would like to show the effective date October 1, 1999 on both
agreements, if you concur.

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Debbie,
 Lisa Mellencamp has requested that we include our summary calculation for 
each Transaction being terminated separately, and specify the Deficiency 
Payment Amount for the period of non performance to the date of 
determination.  I believe that Russell previously stated that we terminated 
the Transactions effective as of 6/19/2000.  For that reason why are the 
amounts broken out for 6/20; 6/21-30; and 7/1-term?  She also wants to know 
what rate of interest are we demanding from the Termination Date.  Once I 
have the above information, I will send the attached letter as modified for 
the above.

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Subject: FW: Mortgage Agreement



FYI,
The following was conveyed to Dan Bump via a telephone conversation:

 In order to operate in the states of WY and MT, Enernet of Wyoming,
LLC (EOW)
 executed 3 operating bonds (1) $10,000 bond to WY State Office of
Lands and Investments
 (2) $25,000 statewide operating bond in favor of the MT BLM and (3)
a $50,000 statewide  operating bond in favor of the MT Board of Oil and
Gas Conservation.

 BancFirst guaranteed the $25,000 MT BLM bond, $25,000 of the $50,000
MT State bond and
 the $10,000 WY State Lands bond.  BancFirst required EOW to execute
two $25,000 promissory
 notes to secure the banks guarantees.  Enernet, Inc., (50%
owner/member of EOW)and its owners  guaranteed the promissory notes for
the bank.

 EOW can immediately move to have one if not both of these promissory
notes cancelled in order
 not to impede the mortgage transaction with Enron.  Alternatively,
in the very near future,
 EOW will transfer all of its operated properties in MT to the new
operating entity currently  being formed by Quantum and US Energy.  When
the new operating entity is in place, EOW will
 immediatedly transfer operations on all existing properties to the
new entity.  Once  operations are transfered EOW will request
cancellation of all MT bonding, which, will be
 appproved by the BLM and the MT State Board of Oil and Gas upon the
successful transfer of
 operations from EOW to the new entity.  With the MT bonds cancelled,
BancFirst will release
 the mortgage in question.

 EOW owns 2.5% of the Bonepile lease.

This should not be an obstacle in this transaction.  If Enron makes it one,
it can be taken out of
the equation.

The Enron record check in progress should reveal that 97.5% of the Bonepile
lease should be free
and clear of liens and encumbrances but for the JOA recording supplements
filed routinely by EOW and
other operators.

I will await the next communication from Dan Bump or Dan Hyvl.

Gentlemen:

Latest version of subject document attached for your review.

I've been told to advise you that Enron would like to do further due
diligence (e.g. credit analysis, etc.) to get comfortable with Enernet's
existing mortgage(s) to have a good understanding of the situation.  Same
me need to be done for Quantum.  In other words, the agreement below could
be amended based on further analysis.

I'll let you know if anything materializes other than a phone call from
Enron credit to Enernet for information.

Dan

Dave,
     As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for
the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is
the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant
delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore,
please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for
execution by Enron.

If you could let me know that it's OK, we will make change and execute.

 This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any

need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.

Deirdre,
 A red line provided by Kim Decell is attached at the end of this email.  
Without getting into the language specifics which need to be addressed, the 
areas of concern relate to Transaction formation procedure (verbal versus 
signed agreement), Nominated Quantity and Maximum Daily Quantity is used 
interchangeably when the term most likely should be Daily Contract Quantity 
or Minimum Daily Quantity.  Term Purchase Quantity is used which means that a 
default cannot occur until the end of the term when there is no longer any 
time left for the buyer to be able to request the necessary quantities 
(default to be determined by using the last day(s) of term prices eventhough 
default may have occurred on the front end of transaction), Provides for 
fixed prices without obligation of any fixed volumes, Point of Sale and Point 
of Receipt needs to be made the same, Limitation of Liability and 
Responsibility for Taxes need to be changed to Enron language, Triggering 
Events needs to be expanded to fit Enron concepts, No free walks for 
regulatory risks, force majeure needs to address Enron concepts, corporate 
guaranty needs to be payment not performance, collateral threshold needs to 
be reinserted and updated by Credit for Master verses one-off language.

Dan,

I have attached a document which compares the draft Master Contract to last
year's contract.  The majority of the changes you will see are necessary to
convert a deal-specific contract to something more like a set of "general
terms and conditions" that will be supplemented with the deal-specifics in a
Transaction Confirmation.  These essential changes include (1) the
replacement of any deal-specific item such as price, point of sale, contract
quantity with a reference to the Transaction Confirmation, (2) the inclusion
of language for Firm Baseload, Firm Swing and Firm Swing with Term Purchase
Quantity so that all types of purchase arrangements are addressed and (3)
the addition of Sections 1, 2 and 4 to introduce and explain "Master
Contract" and "Transaction Confirmation".  These changes necessarily lead to
more definitions.

In addition, we have created our own Events of Default language which is
almost identical to Enron's Triggering Events language.  We can discuss any
changes you might like to make to our language.

The remaining variances, with 2 notable exceptions, are subject to
negotiation and these include liability language at Section 10.3 and the
removal or replacement of Locked Prices language at Section 8.3.  The 2
items we are not willing to change are (1) Section 9 Taxes and (2) the
addition of the previous Collateral Requirement/Termination Payment
Threshold language.  These were accepted last year ONLY because the parties
had agreed to certain purchase terms and the effective date of the contract
had passed.

For all the reasons above, we cannot use last year's contract verbatim.
However, I believe what we have is, with the 2 exceptions, very similar to
last year's contract.  I appreciate that we all spent a lot of time getting
last year's contract finalized and it reinforced the need for us to have an
executed set of general terms & conditions in place PRIOR to the bidding
process.  We are targeting March 31 for execution of Master Contracts with
all parties desiring to bid in Wisconsin Public Service's RFP, which is
expected to take place in early April.

I will be out of the office from 10 am today until Monday, but if you need
to contact me during this time, either leave a voice mail, which I will be
checking, or send an email which will be forwarded to Tim Sexton.

Thanks for your help Dan.

Kim,
     I am again in receipt of the proposed Wisconsin Public Service form of
Master Contract.  My comments remain the same as they were last year.  If
we need to get to a contract quickly, I would suggest we start with the
version that was signed last year, or simply amend last years contract for
this years volume and price.  What is your preference?

Karen,
 I have reviewed the redline document that Debra Perlingiere spent time on.  
It is not a finished product and needs a great deal of work.  I will continue 
to work on it.  Apparently the redlining must have been confusing and I need 
to start fresh.  I will try to get the redline to you as soon as possible.  
If we need to put something in place before the contract is executed, maybe 
we can document the transaction under the existing GISB contract currently in 
place between the parties and agree that the transaction will be rolled up 
under the new master once the Master is executed.

Dan, Brent, Shari - 

We have been asked to review the provisions of Truequote - a third party 
trading platform - on which Enron may possibly trade.  I have requested 
access for each of you to the site (www.truequote.com) and hope to have this 
for each of you a bit later today.  In order to get you started, I have 
provided the general product descriptions below.

The use of this system is in conjunction with another deal we are currently 
working on with Truequote which will enable counterparties to hit Enron 
posted prices and transact with Enron through the Truequote site.  

Timing on this matter is rather tight as we need to finalize all agreements 
and be ready to begin using the Truequote site on Monday, March 12.  
Therefore, please initiate a review of the descriptions pertinent to your 
area as soon as possible so that I can coordinate any comments you may have 
with my general comments to the access agreement.  Travis is also working on 
a piece of this deal and will be interested in your comments.

Thanks to each of you.  If you should need anything further, please do not 
hesitate to call me.

Ed,
 We have removed the specific examples of Force Majeure as not being needed 
because the revised 11.2 defines force majeure as an event not anticipated as 
of the date hereof, which is not within the reasonable control of the party 
and which by the exercise of due diligence such party is unable to overcome 
or obtain a commercially reasonable substitute performance thereof, all 
without listing specific types of events which might be considered.
  You are correct in presuming that force majeure cannot be claimed for 
economic purposes which is the reason for the underlined clause in the 
preceding sentence.  By example, assuming that more than one transporter 
could be used to effectuate deliveries to a particular point, if the 
transporter utilized by a party experienced an event of force majeure, the 
Enron revision would require a party to continue performance by obtaining 
transportation on another transporter, irrespective of the cost.  
 I trust that this answers your questions. If not, please feel free to call 
me at (713)853-6895.

Disregard my question about the arbitration process.    AAA selects 5,
Enron/Tea can strike 2 and then AAA can appoint the one arbitrator.   But
even after that, Enron/TEA can challenge AAA selection.   In short, we have
no problem with Enron's arbitration language.

Jared,

Our atty suggests we find get clarification on a couple of issues regarding
your amendments:

Special Provision 11.1:  T GISB is already fairly broad in scope "...any
cause not reasonably withing the control of the party claiming
suspension...."  The amendment to 11.2 repeats the same, but removes
specific examples.
1. Why are the specific examples removed?
2. Am I correct in presuming that Enron wants to make it clear that Force
Majuere cannot be claimed for economic purposes?

Special Provision 13.9:  Under the AAA rules, is only one arbitrator
selected from the very beginning, or are a few arbitrators selected
initially, and then each party can pick and choose until eventually there
is only one official arbitrator?   Like a jury selection...sort of.

Thanks,

Ed

I have asked my assistant, Jan King to schedule a dial in conference call 
with you all tomorrow morning to go over the Palo Alto situation.  I am 
trying to understand the history of the ISDA and Gas negotiations over 
authority so that, as the late comer to the party, I don't tromp all over 
their sensibilities (which I think I may have already done)   In the physical 
power group, we approach the issue of getting proper authorizations from 
cities along the lines set forth in the documentation below.  This is the 
perspective I will be bringing to the conversation and look forward to 
efficiently deciding on how to procede with all agreements with you all 
tomorrow.

The Schedule M I sent the group yesterday is the one that contains mine and 
Pat's revisions. I will attach it again for ease of reference. 



The one we did for City of Azusa is based on the revised form above except 
that we plugged in the relevant Act relating to City of Azusa as well as 
their funds. Also - Azusa did not want to get an external legal opinion so we 
changed that in their Schedule M. Otherwise though, the Schedule M w/ them is 
identical to the revised Schedule M above. Having said that - you are 
certainly welcome to see the Schedule M we signed with City of Azusa and here 
it is:



Take care, 

Shari

Good.  Assuming you received my phone mail with the Earp's address etc.,
can you forward me two originals of the offer so that I can send them on to
the Earps?  Again, their street address is 26 Lily Lane in Crane, TX
79731.  The agreed to price is $45/acre at 640 acres, or $28,800.  I.C.
Earp et ux Irma.
I'll call him and alert him when the paperwork is ready to send, hopefully
tomorrow.

Thanks

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the

no bill of sale is needed.

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.

Subject: Citizens - Deal structure summary

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of 
action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement 
with EAMR.

? Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which 
meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both 
Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy 
details.
? The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between 
$5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
? ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide 
for the insurance premium payment.
? Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is 
agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens 
must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in 
its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services 
agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance 
provisions requested by Citizens.

For reference, the original draft sent to Citizens dated effective January 
15, 2001 is attached below:

Gregg, here are our special provisions that we would like incorporated into
the Gisb Contract.  I don't believe we are interested in an Enfolio
Agreement at this point, I would prefer to get the Gisb contract executed
first.  Thanks for your help in this matter.

Attached are draft documents that address entering into separate transactions 
for
the off-peak and on-peak periods.  As you can see, these documents are 
similar to
the draft round-the-clock MW Turndown transactions that we have been 
discussing.
We are proposing to paper these transactions as if the off-peak each month is 
executed
first and then at a later date the on-peak transactions are executed when the 
gas and 
power prices allow us both to make money.  We have also included language in 
the
transaction agreements to allow negative values in the keep whole and revenue 
sharing
formulas to be carried forward to the end of each quarter and included as a 
true-up in
the last payment of each quarter.  Below is a brief description of the other 
changes:

Off-Peak Transaction:

Different physical plant burns for weekdays or weekends & holidays
Baseload resale of gas back to ENA
ENA's balancing capabilities in Canada will level out varying plant burns
ENA's balancing charges, if any, are included in the keep whole formula
No obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire ( i.e. No Part II )
Hourly average of the off-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formula

On-Peak Transaction:

On-peak LBMP's is used in pricing formulas
ENA obligation to sell incremental gas supply into Empire under Part II


Plase call me with your comments,

Ruth

Alabama Electric confirmed on Monday, 1/4/00, that they will not trigger 
their termination right under our recent Agreement.  

Pursuant to our executed transaction with AEC dated 9/22/99, AEC had the 
right to terminate the Agreement by providing ENA with notice by 12/31/99, if 
AEC had not received environmental clearance from the Rural Utility Services. 

AEC has indicated that while they have not received final clearances from the 
RUS, they are comfortable going at risk under the ENA Agreement.  The 
Agreement is self-implementing in that AEC elected to not give notice.

AEC expects to have their final clearance by mid January.

This transaction can now be booked as a 1Q00 transaction


Thanks to everyone for assistance on this transaction

For what its worth (given that HPL is about to leave the Enron fold and I'll 
have to start all over with AEP's credit group!!), Roche would accept the GTC 
execpt the crucial part about collateral threshold and suggest the below

We presently have approved the following paragraph in regards to hedging

lieu of your article 12 in HPL's Terms and Conditions?? 

Bill 

Financial Responsibility: In the event that in HPL's sole, but good faith, 
business judgment, exercised in a manner consistent with general commercial 
standards, HPL has reasonable grounds for insecurity of RVI's ability to 
perform its obligations under this Agreement, HPL may demand adequate 
assurance of performance from RVI.? Adequate assurance shall mean, but not be

reasonably acceptable to HPL, including, but not limited to, a standby 
irrevocable letter of credit.? If RVI fails to deliver such adequate 
assurance within ten (10) business days following receipt of a written 
request by HPL, then RVI shall be considered to be in default of this 
Agreement. Similarly, in the event that in RVI's sole, but good faith,

Mr. Radigan 

We have developed the language that is required to be able to enter into a 
fixed price transaction for the Freeport Plant. 

Because our existing physical contract is an older format, it proved to be 
cumbersome to modify it.? Therefore, we would enter into a new agreement 
for the fixed price volume as follows: 

(See attached file: roche-gtc-2001-049crfm.doc) 

Any volumes over the fixed price volumes would continue to flow under the 
existing agreement.? The new contract would be the first volumes through 
the meter. 

Please call to dicsuss after you have had a chance to review.

Barbara,
I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

 Please see Brian Redmond note to Brenda below regarding meeting with MidCon 
to talk about their imbalances with Reliant Energy.  This could possible open 
both parties up to a torturous interference argument with Reliant Energy.  Do 
you agree?  If so, we need to nix meeting idea.

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

 <<FFG901_.doc>>
Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am forwarding to you Southern's
comments on your proposed confidentiality agreement.  As you can see,
they are almost entirely editorial and relate to the inclusion of
seemingly duplicative provisions.  The one substantive point is that we
do not agree to venue provisions, although we will agree in this case to
Texas choice of law.

Please let us know if these changes are acceptable in advance of the
Thursday meeting.

Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.

I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.

After reviewing the proposed Master Gas Purchase Agreement, I had one concern 
regarding the Price provision. Under Section 7.1(b) & (c) reference is made 
to the "Index Price" used for deliveries made in excess of the Scheduled 
Amount and for deliveries less than the Scheduled Amount. 

The definition of  Contract Price used in our Transaction Agreement defines 
the price as . . . equal to the "Index Price" published in Inside F.E.R.C.'s 
Gas Market Report for Texas Gas Transmission Zone South Louisiana (large 
packages only) as listed in the table entitled "Delivered Spot-Gas Price" in 
the first-of-the-month issue of such publication for each Month during the 
Period of Delivery plus $0.0025 per MMBtu.

My concern is that there may be some confusion as to what the Index Price 
actually is.  The Index Price has always had the meaning of the First of the 
Month Published Index.  I'm sure the intent in the Master Agreement is for 
the Index Price to equal the published Gas Daily Spot Price for that 
particular location. 

I think that changing the wording from Index Price to Spot Price would save 
some confusion.

John,
 I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be 
provided.

		 Subject: Franklin Adkins Payment Schedule

As you are aware, Franklin Adkins has removeed his meters from ENA effective 
February 1, 2001.  Mr. Adkins has a fixed price, firm deal with ENA  for 
13,000 Dth/month @ $3.075.  The term is 4/1/00 through 3/31/01.  Mr. Adkins 
has breached his contract with ENA by pulling his meters 2 months before the 
end of the contract.

Attached you will find a schedule calculating what we owe Mr. Adkins for 
January 2001 Actuals, LESS the contractual commitments for February and March 
2001.

Should a letter as well as this schedule be sent to Mr. Adkins explaining 
that ENA is reducing his January payment by the February and March 
commitment?  If so, would you write the letter?


John

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

Dan,

Attached is a term sheet that has been sent to Eastern New Mexico gas company 
to extend a four year deal that ends on April 30, 2001.  Could you look into 
the confirmation for this transaction?  They will be going to the board for 
approval at the end of next week so you have some time.  Sorry to bombard 
you!!  This one should be easy.

Thanks,

Kim

Thank you for an overwhelming response to participate in ClickAtHome's Second 
Pilot.    For those of you who have signed up, we are excited to have you in 
this pilot.  We look forward to you testing our process and services and 
giving us feedback!

In order to be eligible for Pilot 2, you must first read and agree to the 
Pilot Participant Agreement and then respond to the 
ClickAtHomePilot2@enron.com email box with the following statement:    "I 
accept the terms and conditions of this Pilot Participant Agreement." with 
the Pilot agreement attached.

Once we have received your acceptance,  you will be eligible and confirmed 
for Pilot 2.

Those who are confirmed for Pilot 2 will receive an email the week of 
November 13th on how and when they can access the ordering website.  Until 
that point,  the website will not be accessible.

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on the website.  We would like 
you to review more details about out-of-pocket costs once the pilot website 
is available.  After agreeing to the Pilot Participants Agreement and 
reviewing these materials on the website, you may choose to defer ordering 
until the All Employee roll-out in early 2001 if you wish.


Thanks!

Dan,

Can you please look over the attached Gty format for Unocal Energy Trading to

NOTE FROM MARK FREVERT

With the wide and varied activities of our three organizations, we created=
=20
this e-mail newsletter to keep everyone better informed about our various=
=20
businesses.  I hope you find it informative and more importantly, that you=
=20
will use this newsletter to help spread the word about the successes in you=
r=20
group.

To provide content for future e-mails, contact Michelle Vitrella in our=20
Public Relations group via e-mail or call her at ext. 3-9767.  Communicatio=
n=20
is one of the core Enron values and I believe this is a great way to improv=
e=20
communication across our wholesale businesses.

Additionally, I would like to again encourage everyone to take a few minute=
s=20
to complete =01&The Pulse=018 survey.  This annual survey regarding the wor=
k=20
experience at Enron and how we can make it better is an important part of t=
he=20
two-way communication process at Enron.  Please go to the Enron intranet an=
d=20
type survey.enron.com.  It only takes a few minutes, it=01,s confidential a=
nd=20
your comments will help make Enron a better place to work.

the world, Frito Lay.

Pulp & Paper
With the acquisition of Garden State Paper and launch of Clickpaper.com,=20
Enron is creating an efficient spot physical market for pulp and paper=20
commodities.  Buyers and sellers will benefit from improved price=20
transparency and reliability and access to Enron=01,s online financial mark=
ets.

Improved price transparency and the ability to imbed financial derivatives=
=20
into physical trading flows will facilitate the growth of Enron=01,s tradin=

business.  To date, Clickpaper.com has traded over 1 millions tons of pulp=
=20
and paper product with a notional value of over $675 million.

Upstream Origination
Upstream Origination, headed by Julie Gomez and Jean Mrha, focuses on natur=
al=20

ch=20
as storage, electric compression and producer services & outsourcing, ENA=
=20
creates value for its customers and reconfigures the natural gas=20
infrastructure to be more efficient.  In addition, Upstream Origination=20
transactions exploit the unique relationship between development of strateg=
ic=20
assets through sophisticated financing structures and the utilization of th=
e=20
market information created by those assets.

As of Wednesday, October 18, the total responses to =01&The Pulse=018 from=

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Dan,

Attached below is another Netting Agreement that this counteparty would like 
to have executed.  This is mainly an active Canadian counterparty (where we 
have all contracts executed with ECC) but they also do business with ENA.  
The exposures are getting significant enough where they are needing netting 
arrangements.  

Please take a look at this draft that they have forwarded below.  If you find 
it unacceptable, let me know and I will communicate it to the counterparty 
and forward ours.  They initiated this and preferred we view their "simple" 
document.

Thanks,

Veronica

basically my final offer.

Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of

agreement regarding Enernet which you sent to me.  I have made some
suggestions, several of which deal with beefing up the consideration for
the subordination for enforceability purposes.  The form of
acknowledgment that you forwarded to me is fine, as long as the

Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle

Yates asked us to prepare amendments to the referenced agreements to include 
their West Kitty prospect under the current agreement.  (Of course, if its 
easier, you could create another document).  Here are the particulars:


Reserve Commitment Area  --  Section 36 of 51N/74W 

Gathering Services Fee = $0.21 per Mcf

Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) = 6,000 Mcf/d

Purchase Price  (i) baseload  IFGMR CIG Index less $0.04
  (ii) swing  Gas Daily CIG Index less $0.04

Let me know how you would like to proceed (amendment v. separate contract) 
and if you need additional info.


Thanks.

Sounds good.  We intend to bring the fixings for the burgers, that is , meat, 
onions, lettuce, tomatoes, 16 big buns and 8 small buns.  I think that mom 
has enough mustard and mayonnaise.  If you think we need more buns, let me

Dan--

I forgot one item re: Coleman.  Coleman has a few wells that will be flowing 
thru a 3rd party gathering system into Fort Union.  As part of this bigger 
deal with Coleman, we are going to add this receipt point (Exhibit C of 
services agreement) / delivery point (Exhibit C of purchase agreement) to 
these contracts.

The gathering services fee for this point only will be $0.145 per mcf 
(essentially the Fort Union fee).  The marketing provisions would stay the 
same under the gas purchase agreement.

I will get you the meter # and other details, but for now would you call it 
the "Bear Paw / Fort Union interconnect" and reflect the $0.145 per mcf rate.

Thanks

D

Are you the steve referred to in item 1.  If so what is the difference 
between monthly business between Tufco and monthly business with another 
prohibited party either Lone Star Gas Company or Southern Union Gas Company.  
There should be no difference.

Subject: Re: ECT and HPLR contracts not to be transferred to HPL  

I have given this information to Tom Martin, Greg McClendon and Ed Gottlob.  
Their questions/comments are summarized below.

TUFCO:  Tom has discussed with both Barbara and Steve that the desk (now 
HPLC) will be "trading" with TUFCO on a monthly and daily basis.  He 
understands that the term business needs to remain in ECT but that HPLC CAN 
trade with TUFCO.  This needs to be confirmed.
When reviewing the listing, all asked questions as to why certain 
municipalities were not included in the "prohibited" listing.  I explained 
our process of reviewing the counterparties, and how we noted the reason they 
were excluded (ie, sales to City of Austin are for power generation only).  
Can someone recap the counterparties reviewed as well as the logic for their 
exclusion from the prohibited list?  I would like to review it with 
Commercial.
I assume that Melissa is addressing the Western Gas Resources, Inc - Texas 
issue.
I discussed with Tom his feelings on the "marketing" enntitiy agreements 
remaining in ECT.  He believes it is more important to move as much of the 
business to HPLC than any benefits derived from the contracts remaining in 
ECT.  Therefore, we will assign those contracts with the marketing arms of 
prohibited companies such as Entex Gas Marketing.
I have talked with Joe Deffner regarding monetized contracts.  He is 
discussing with Kristina Mordant of Legal who is researching the 
documentation.  Initially they felt there were no large issues which would 
interfere but reserved complete answers until the review is completed.  My 
listing of monetized agreements include the following:  Brandywine, 
DEI/Calpine, GSU/Entergy, Southern Union, TUFCO, Union Carbide and Entex.
The transport agreements need to be reviewed.  Elsa Villarreal is out on 
vacation beginning 5/28 until 6/14.  She is reviewing the listing today and 
tommorrow, and is providing her advise as to terminations and new 
agreements.  I will coordinate with Darren Farmer also.

Subject: ECT and HPLR contracts not to be transferred to HPL

I have again reviewed the master listing which Melissa prepared last Thursday 
and compared the names thereon to the RRC listing of Investor Owned Companies 
Filing Annual Reports for calendar year 1997.  Based thereon, the following 
companies should be excluded from the gas sales agreements being transferred 
to HPL:

City of Brazoria
D & H Gas Company, Inc.
Empire Pipeline Corp.
Entex, a Division of NorAm Energy Corp.
Gulf Gas Utilities Company
Lone Star Gas Company
Markham Gas Corp.
Oasis Pipe Line Company
Petrofina Gas Pipeline Company
Reliant Energy - Entex
Southern Union Company  ---- This should be "Southern  Union Gas Company, a 
division of               Southern Union Company"
Southern Union Gas Company
Texas Utilities Fuel Company
Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc.


Additionally, we need to verify that Global Contract # 96003955 is not 
"Western Gas Resources-Texas, Inc."  If it is, it should also be excluded.

Also excluded is the Central Desk deal with "Central Illinois Light Company".

Have we determined if the agreements with "Entex Gas Marketing Company" and 
"Mercado Gas Services, Inc." are staying or going?

Alan, Doug signed the fuel agreements for Nicaragua last friday.  We are 
waiting for Glencore to sign the contracts, at which time all of the 
documents will have been signed and delivered.  EI has agreed to indemnify 
EFI and reimburse any out of pocket costs should EI elect to take EFI out of 
the fuel arrangement.  EFI has a put to the project and Glencore if Enron 
elects to get out of the project.

I don't think Brian, the President of HPL should be having any meetings with 
Entex................if someone is to meet with Entex, it needs to be an ENA 
person; similarly, we should not be asking for a meeting with Entex.  If 
ENTEX wants to schedule a joint meeting,it might be okay to 
attend............depending on the subject matter...........ANYTHING HAVING 
TO DO WITH PRICING SHOULD NOT BE DISCUSSED...........i BELIEVE MORE FACTS

Barbara,
I had a chance to look at this again and I have left a note for Dan (he 
wasn't in his office) indicating that if by "I think we should involve MidCon 
in the discussions" Brian intends a joint meeting among ENA, MidCon and Entex 
to discuss the correction fo nomination irregularities, I think that's an 
acceptable proposal.  If, however, Brian intends a private meeting between 
MidCon and ENA to discuss our respective contractual obligations to Entex, 
then I think Dan needs fo advise Brian of the risks attendant to such a 
meeting.  

Do you agree?

Brenda,

Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex 
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex 
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these 
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.

We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I 
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to 
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would 
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve 
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing 
nominations.  

The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a 
solution to past sins and a way forward.

Brian

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

Hi Dan:

Just an update to let you know the status of the agreements between Reliant
and Enovate and Enron.  They are both being routed internally prior to
execution.  However, due to the "Notices" section missing from the Enovate
contract, Legal has asked that I forward that to you for execution prior to
Reliant's execution.  I hope that this is not a problem.

Dan, I don't want this contract to get misdirected, Enron's so large and
that could easily happen.  Could you please send me your direct mailing
address so that I may send it directly to you for your further handling?
Thanks, I appreciate so much your help in getting these two agreements
completed.

YOu can either call me or email me your direct mailing address and I'll
send you the Enovate contract as soon as I receive it.

Thank you,
Ellen

Dan--

I reviewed the latest Quantum docs (on my machine) and I had only two 
revisions.

1)  In the purchase agreement, look at my note re: the definition of 
"Gathering Services" (its related to the following revision #2).

2)  In the gathering agreement, I adjusted the allocation between the 
compression portion of the total services rate and the gathering portion of 
the rate per Quantum's request.  I'm sorry the redlining of my revision did 
not happen, but I feel its correct.

Talk with you this afternoon.

Thanks.

Dan / Shonnie:

Please review the attached turn of the Coleman documents.  As you will see, 
their attorney (Howard Hartzburg of Jones & Keller in Denver) made numerous 
stylistic changes and some substantive changes.

I have discussed a few of the substantive changes with Coleman and told them 
that, at this late stage, stylistic changes will slow us down.  Of course, 
they responded that their changes "just helped the contract to be easier to 
read".

Let me know your thoughts. 

Thanks.

Dan

Mark,
 I have made the changes noted in the fax which you sent to Jeff.  If the 
contract is acceptable, please print off 2 originals and have them signed and 
forward to Jeff for signature by ENA.  Once the contract is finally executed, 
Jeff will return one fully executed original to you for your files.

Mark,
 Jeff is in London and asked me to make the requested changes to the 
Contract.  I have taken the redline version that he previously provided and 
added the additional changes.  The changes that I made were in 4.2 (15 days), 
Art. 5 (deleted "but for no longer period"), and in  Arbitration (added 
language for independent arbitrators based on the amount in controversy), and 
changed (Texas to New York in the 12th line).   I have also attached a clean 
copy which accepted all of the redline changes.  If acceptable, please print 
2 originals of the clean copy, have them signed, fax me a copy of the signed 
signature page at 7136463490, and mail the two signed originals to me.  Once 
I receive the faxed signature page, I will let Jennifer know so that she can 
have any subsequent transactions entered into pursuant to the terms of this 
contract.  Please call me at 7138536895 if you have any questions.

Could you change paragraph iii at the end of Representations and Warranties
to read:

"(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment under the ordinances of the City of San
Antonio which govern payments by Customer."

There are no indentures to which CPS is a party.  Thanks ...

Mr. Wood,

As requested, Enfolio shortened and simplified the section on
Representations and Warranties.  The new language is highlighted on page 2
of the Appendix and states the following:

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows: (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to claim immunity on
the grounds of sovereignty or similar grounds with respect to itself or its
revenues, (iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are
unsubordinated obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance
costs which enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all
indentures to which it is a party."

Do you feel that this language is acceptable?  Thank you for your advice.

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to
debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I
have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and
warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:
(i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures
to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

Okay as drafted; however, I would still prefer it if we could get them to 
sign and return the confirm to us on these fixed priced deals.

Christian,
     I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached
contract document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended
that the Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on
any invoice that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way
that we have to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.
Therefore, i have not removed that line from the address,  At such time as
the Purchase Order Number is available, please send a revised address
notice to the company containing such number.  Until that happens, it will
be understood that no number has been provided.  Please call if you have
any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed
a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Dan, I spoke again with Theresa Burr at Entex.  She said the attorney she was 
speaking with asked her to look at the other masters we have with
them and use those as the guidelines.  Well, she noticed that he had crossed 
out some stuff on the Entex master that he or some other attorney had agreed 
to previously on another Master we have with them.  She said she would finish 
reviewing the Entex Master and coordinate the contract with Maggie Ortiz in 
our Contracts Administration group.  Maggie and Theresa have established some 
communications and I thought I'd let our contract group work with theirs.

I will be out of the office the next two weeks.  If you have any questions, 
please speak with Maggie or Julie Meyers.  Julie is now handling all Texas 
business.

Janet,
 I agree with Kyle, however, Ducote indicated that Bruce told him that they 
wanted it in Entex Gas Marketing Company.  They sent us draft paper for a 
spot gisb, however, we don't normally put long term firm under the gisb so, I 
redrafted the transactions under the Master Firm Purchase Sale agreement 
which they are reviewing.  I recall that Joe Casas called me to say that 
Entex had some comments concerning the fact that they did not record phone 
conversations and only wanted us to record the portion of a call that was 
specific to a deal.  So far, I have not received those comments from Joe.

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Oscar,
 I changed para 2 back to unilateral because there is no way for Enron to 
have the information to issue a notice of termination on 11/30/99, only AEC 
will be privy to that and in the event they do not issue notice by that date 
they should remain bound to the deal. I assume that is the only change you 
made to the agreement I drafted last night.  As such I have attached the 
modified version for your use with Credit prior to sending same to AEC this 
morning.

Hey Russell and Jon,

As you are aware, we have been trying to get Engage Energy Canada, L.P. 
("Engage") to execute an updated master physical firm gas purchase and sale 
agreement (an "Amended Physical Master") over the last two and a half years 
with no success.  Until this week, we had received no comments from Engage 
with respect to our suggested amendments (despite sending four distinct forms 
of amendments starting in August, 1998).

The matter came to a head in June of this year when the Credit department 
wanted to call for collateral from Engage.  The existing (1994) agreement 
does not provide for this right.  As a result, we have been pressing this 
counterparty to execute the Amended Physical Master.  However, the 
counterparty has delayed providing comments repeatedly.  Through Russell's 
diligence, the general counsel of Engage gave me another call on Tuesday and 
(finally) provided some comments on the agreement.  In addition to a few 
minor nits, the general counsel has informed me that he will not provide 
comments on the "credit related" provisions of the Amended Physical Master.  

He has told me that Engage requires that we put in place 
credit/collateral/netting agreements which contemplate:
a.  physical transactions (gas and power);
b.  financial transactions (gas and power);
c. all Enron entities which transact with Engage and Engage Energy America 
Corp. (i.e. ECC, ENA, EPMI and any other entity) (as a result, the agreements 
would have to contemplate US/Canada distinctions as well).

Such counsel refuses to proceed in any other manner at this time.  Further, 
he has expressly told me that he will not go to Westcoast Energy Inc. to 
provide a  guarantee which is specific to the Amended Physical Master.

In order to comply with Engage's demands (i.e. preparing a master netting 
agreement, a master credit/collateral agreement and a mechanism by which we 
would be able to monitor exposure across all parties and products) I believe 
will be a fairly large undertaking (considering the emerging nature of the 
physical power market, the complexities involved and the general lack of 
response we have experienced with Engage over the last 2.5 years).  However, 
I understand that we have undertaken such a task on occasion in the past 
(albeit, without additional concept of power trading) with respect to 
particularly important trading partners.

Frankly, I am concerned that Engage's position (although, theoretically a 
good concept) is just another stalling technique.  Nevertheless, I will leave 
the decision as to the manner to proceed with Engage to you.   

Please give me a call to discuss this matter when you get the chance ((403) 
974-6708).

Thanks,

Mark Powell.

Alan:

Thank you very much for talking today with Phil and myself.  We want to 
continue this dialogue as we attempt to resolve our quality issues at Elba 
Island with Southern LNG (and El Paso Merchant Energy). 

I wanted to send you, on a confidential basis, the firm transportation 
obligations as set forth in our arrangements with El Paso Merchant Energy, in 
order to determine how they might complement any you might have with respect 
to your natural gas demand load upstream of the Elba facility on the Southern 
Natural Gas pipeline system.


"If Enron Americas nominates gas for transportation on the SNG pipeline 
system, (i) Enron Americas or an affiliate thereof must have subscribed 
(directly from SNG) to firm transportation on the SNG system for a term not 
less than the lesser of ten (10) years or the then-remaining term of the 
Agreement, (ii) the Elba Island Facility must be, and remain during the 
duration of such firm transportation, the primary receipt point for such firm 
transportation, and (iii) such firm transportation (in MMBtu per day) shall 
be for a quantity equal to the quantity of gas (in MMBtu per day) nominated 
in the Redelivery Notice to be redelivered to Enron Americas on the SNG 
system ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the "Firm Transportation 
Requirement")."


After you have had a chance to evaluate these provisions, I would like to 
discuss the matter with you.

Regards.
Les Webber

Mike,
 I have reviewed the requested changes to Exhibit D, I am okay with the 
proposed changes so long as the same changes are made to Exhibit C.  The 
change to Suspension of performance on Appendix 1 is okay.  The collateral 
requirement language has been in the contract for some time so I am concerned 
with bringing up changes at this late date; however, please let me know your 
concern so that we can resolve the issue with the Enron Credit group.

Attached is a copy of Ormet's mark-up to the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement 
post V.P. of Finance review.  The changes are primarily to Exhibit D.  
Additionally, there is one chage under Suspension of Performance on Appendix 
1 page "1"-3.  Finally, we need to address the collateral 
requirment/termination payment threshhold in section 4.3.
Thanks,
Mike

A woman goes to her boyfriend's parents' house for dinner. This is to be her 
first time meeting the family and she is very nervous. They all sit down and 
begin eating a fine meal.

The woman is beginning to feel a little discomfort, thanks to her nervousness 
and the broccoli casserole. The gas pains are almost making her eyes water. 
Left with no other choice, she decides to relieve herself a bit and lets out 
a dainty fart. It wasn't loud, but everyone at the table heard the poof. 
Before she even had a chance to be embarrassed, her boyfriend's father looked 
over at the dog that had been snoozing at the woman's feet and said in a 
rather stern voice, "Skippy!"

The woman thought, "This is great!" and a big smile came across her face. A 
couple of minutes later, she was beginning to feel the pain again. This time, 
she didn't even hesitate. She let a much louder and longer fart rip. The 
father again looked and the dog and yelled, "Dammit Skippy!"

Once again the woman smiled and thought "Yes!" A few minutes later the woman 
had to let another one rip. This time she didn't even think about it. She let 
rip a fart that rivaled a train whistle blowing.

Once again, the father looked at the dog with disgust and yelled, "Dammit 
Skippy, get away from her before she craps all over you!"

Ellen,
 You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you 
execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the 
information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

I've spoken with Eric Moon who provided Russell with the termination payment 
amount ; he has agreed to breakdown the numbers by transaction. 
He will send it over to us as soon as possible.

Subject: Cage -Termination Amount

Debbie,
 Lisa Mellencamp has requested that we include our summary calculation for 
each Transaction being terminated separately, and specify the Deficiency 
Payment Amount for the period of non performance to the date of 
determination.  I believe that Russell previously stated that we terminated 
the Transactions effective as of 6/19/2000.  For that reason why are the 
amounts broken out for 6/20; 6/21-30; and 7/1-term?  She also wants to know 
what rate of interest are we demanding from the Termination Date.  Once I 
have the above information, I will send the attached letter as modified for 
the above.

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell

Please see item 8 of the attached GTC.  When the outside party does not 
provide the Gas from an alternate source or fails to take the Gas to an 
alternate market, such event is a default allowing us to collect damages for 
non-performance.  No different than any of our standard Enfolio contracts.  
The current language in our GISB form gets us to the same result.

Sorry to keep bothering you, but does what we talked about earlier pertain to 
EOL trades as well given the language in those contracts, i.e. requiring 
outside parties to honor contracts if they claim "force majeure"?

Fran,
 I understand from John Blaylock that I am to direct an email to you 
regarding the treatment of certain vested Enron benefits.  My name was 
included on the list of attorneys and paralegals with whom AEP could talk to 
regarding possible employment for continuation of legal representation for 
HPL's business lines.  I met with Gary Prescott yesterday and do not know 
whether AEP will or will not make an offer.  However, in the event they elect 
to make an offer, I would like to know what my options are relating to (1) my 
vested Enron stock options, (2) any unvested options, (3) the Enron Savings 
Plan.  Regarding the Savings Plan, would I be allowed to leave the funds in 
the plan, as if I had retired, or would I be required or permitted to roll 
those amounts into a rollover IRA?  What actions would I need to take 
regarding the amounts that are in the Deferred Compensation Plan?  

 Enron is currently subsidizing a portion of the costs of internet services 
through Time Warner Roadrunner.  Will these costs continue to be subsidized, 
and if so, by whom?

 LET'S MAKE SOME COOKIES!!!

THIS IS A TRUE STORY

A little background: Neiman-Marcus, if you
 don't know already is a very
expensive store i.e. they sell your typical
 $8.00 t-shirt for $50.00.Lets let them have it!!!
My daughter and I had just finished a salad
at a Neiman-Marcus Cafe
 in Dallas and decided to have a small dessert. Because
 both of us are such
 cookie lovers, we decided to try the "Neiman-Marcus
Cookie." It was so excellent
 that I asked if they would give me the recipe
 and the waitress said with a
small frown, "I'm afraid not but, you can buy
 the recipe."

 Well, I asked how much, and she responded,
"Only two fifty, it's a great deal!" I agreed with approval, just add it to
 my tab I told her. Thirty days later, I received my VISA statement and it was
 $285.00. I looked again and
 I remembered I had only spent $9.95 for two salads and about $20.00
 for a scarf. As I glanced at the bottom of the
 statement, it said, Cookie Recipe -$250.00" That was outrageous!

I called Neiman's Accounting Dept. and told them the waitress said it
 was "two-fifty," which clearly does not mean "twohundred and fifty dollars"
by any *POSSIBLE* interpretation of the phrase.= Neiman-Marcus
 refused to budge.They would not refund my money, because
 according to them, "What the
 waitress told you is not our problem. You have already seen the
 recipe. We absolutely will not refund you money at this point."

 I explained to her the criminal statues which
 govern fraud in Texas. I threatened to refer them to The Better
 Business Bureau and the State Attorney General Office for engaging in fraud.
I was basically told,"Do what you want, it doesn't matter, we're not refunding
 your money." I waited, thinking of how I could get even, or even try and get 
any
 of my money back.
 I just said, "Okay, you folks got my $250, and now I'm going to have
 $250.00 worth of fun."
 I told her that I was going to see to it that every Cookie lover in
the United States with an e-mail account has a $250.00 cookie recipe from
 Neiman-Marcus...for free. She replied, "I wish you wouldn't do this." I
said, "Well, you should have thought of that before you ripped me off," and
 slammed down the phone on her.

So here it is!!! Please, please, please pass it on to everyone youcan
 possibly think of. I paid $250 for this...I don't want Neiman-Marcus
to *ever* get another penny off of this recipe....

 NEIMAN MARCUS COOKIES (Recipe may be halved)
2 cups butter
 4 cups flour
2 tsp. soda
 2 cups sugar
 5 cups blended oatmeal ***
24 oz. chocolate chips
 2 cups brown sugar
 1 tsp. salt
 4 eggs
1 - 8 oz. Hershey Bar (grated
 2 tsp. baking powder
 2 tsp. vanilla
3 cups chopped nuts (your choice)

* Measure oatmeal and blend in a blender to a fine powder.
 * Cream the butter and both sugars.
 * Add eggs and vanilla, mix together with flour, oatmeal, salt, baking 
powder, and soda.
 * Add chocolate chips, Hershey Bar and nuts.

 Roll into balls and place two inches apart on
 a cookie sheet.
* Bake for 10 minutes at 375 degrees.
 * Makes 112 cookies.

 PLEASE READ IT AND SEND TO EVERY PERSON YOU
KNOW WHO HAS AN E-MAIL
ADDRESS!
 THIS IS REALLY TERRIFIC!

 Have fun!!! This is not a joke-this is a true
story. Ride free,
 citizens

Dan, thanks.  I will review the contract changes later today or tomorrow.
And thank you for the response on the resolution.  I've heard that this item
will be presented to the council for adoption on March 12.  That's the
earliest date.  I will coordinate with our staff on other matters that need
attending to get this done.  Thanks for your help.  Grant Kolling.

office that
  they will issue a Certificate of Incumbency showing that the
person
  executing the contract for ENA is authorized to execute
contracts for ENA.
  No other party signs as to form or terms, however, the
officer executing
  for ENA will require that the deal person and I initial on

  his signature.  I have reviewed the proposed draft
resolution.  ENA will
  accept the enacted resolution and will not require that the
City Attorney
  issue an opinion.  If the attached contract is acceptable,
please print off
  2 originals, have them approved, signed and forward to me
for ENA's

executed, I will return
  one fully executed original to you for the City's file.

2001-012bcrfm is the one month extension which has been revised to reflect 
the reduced DCQ and the changed price for the first 8,000 MMBtu per day.

2001-012abrcrfm is the redline version of the proposed Transaction Agreement 
which has been changed to provide that Westvaco is to only provide 
alternative delivery point information to Company when Westvaco receives 
volumes through such points which should have been received from Company.  

2001-012abcrfm is the clean version of the above redlined Transaction 
Agreement .

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending 
the term is that we do not know what conditions Texas Gas may put on the next 
OFO nor do we know what conditions El Paso may put on the processing.

I agree with you on points 2,5,8.  just delete them in the confirm.

With regards to point 2. As long as the language reflects that best efforts 
are taken to buy/sell gas at Daily Index when required and then it goes to a 
fixed price I am fine with it.

Gregg:

I am in receipt of your e-mail regarding enovate documentation.  My thoughts 
appear below.

1)  As to Reliant, Dan spoke to me about this last week.  By copy of this, I 
am asking him to update you.

2) I  previously gave Mary my comments and told her I was fine.  I believe I 
have seen her response to Petro-Canada.  As to the reimbursement agreement, I 
believe it is in Clement's stack to work on.  I will call him to see where he 
stands.

3) As to OGE Resources, I am planning on looking at that when I return from 
London.

I hope that all makes sense.  If I can be of further help, let me know.

Jeff

Jeff - I am trying to clean up some of the outstanding third party 
documents.  Any help or guidance you can provide on any of these items is 
greatly appreciated.

1)  Reliant - 
 enovate purchased gas supply from Reliant which starts flowing December 1.  
We are trying to get the Master put in place for this transaction.  Stacy 
Dixon was working on it, but I believe that Dan Hyvl is working on it now.  I 
have not heard back from Dan lately, but know that both the legal and 
commercial representatives from Reliant have phoned repeatedly to paper this 
transaction.

2)  PetroCanada -
enovate purchased gas supply from PetroCanada which started flowing November 
1.  I have heard that Mary Klyasheff has provided some comments on the 
Master.  Mary is waiting to hear that we are okay with the draft before 
sending it on to PetroCanada.  If you say its fine, its fine with me.  Also, 
I have not heard anything from Clement regarding the reimbursement 
agreement.  Peoples continues to ask about its status.

3)  OG&E Resources - 
Negotiate Master Purchase/Sale Agreement and GISB.  OG&E has provided 
comments which I believe I sent to you for review.  No deal is pending, but 
OG&E has phoned repeatedly to get these put in place.

I know that this is becoming cumbersome, but I appreciate your help.  Going 
forward, if you have any suggestions on how to ease the resource drain I am 
open to anything.  Also, let me know if we should be using a different point 
person other than you.  

That's all for now.  I am sure I will have more soon.

Thanks - Gregg

Grant,
 The problem is that they do not want to assign the agreement.  They want to 
do a partial assignment which is unacceptable unless we can severe the 
document so that we have two separate stand alone pieces of paper after the 
assignment.  Talk to them about doing two Spot Confirmations, one for 0 to 
8,400 MMBtu per day which would not be assignable, and the other one for 0 to 
11,600 MMBtu per day which would be assignable to BP.  Call me so that we can 
discuss.

Enron Fuels International (EFI) has a long term gasoil supply agreement with 
HMPC which has not been used for several years. What is the current and 
future status of the plant? If the plant is not going to operate and not need 
liquid fuel deliveries, then I need someone within HMPC to send a formal 
notice to EFI cancelling the fuel supply contract. We have requested this 
several times over the past few years to no avail.

The Chicago address is correct.  I have a call in to Doug Nelson to inquire 
why he gave the Houston address.  I will let you know as soon as I hear from 
Doug.  Where do we stand on the changes to financially firm? What was our 
original definition of firm and is the proposed GISB definition consistent 
with our original definition?

Thanks - Gregg

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

Barry:

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between 
Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a 
second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we 
discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if 
ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I 
have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second 
opinion. 

Thanks

Kim,
 I have reviewed your markup of the redlined contract I forwarded to you last 
Wednesday.  Since you confirmed that we were merely putting into place a 
three month contract, we should be able to resolve the issues rather 
quickly.  If we were working on the Master, I would agree that we are a long 
way apart.  Let me respond to the changes you put in your last redline.

 1. Delete the definition of "Credit Support Provider".
 2. Add definition as follows:  The term "Guarantor" means, as to Seller, 
Seller's ultimate parent, Enron Corp.
 3. Restore the definition of Material Adverse Change to the language as 
provided in my redline to you.  It is the position of our Credit Department 
that a rating of BBB- is considered investment grade and as such that is the 
benchmark below which a material adverse change would be triggered.  Enron 
Corp. is currently rates as BBB.
 4. The changes that you made in 2.1.1, 2.1.2, and 2.2.1 are okay.  The 
change that was made to 2.2.2. should be deleted.
 5. The change that was made to 2.3.1 and 2.4.1 is okay. 
 6. The changes that were made in 9.1 should be removed because the sale and 
purchase quantity is based on the DCQ.   Note that all settlements under the 
Contract are based on the DCQ and any variations between actual and DCQ is to 
be handled between the party and its transporter. 
 7. The change in 9.3 should be changed back to five (5) Days instead of 10 
Days.  5 days is the equivalent of 60 days deliveries, changing to 10 would 
mean 65 delivery days have elapsed before the Seller can notify Buyer of a 
payment default.
 8. The change in 10.2 of "at or" should be restored.  This is a 3 month 
deal.  Seller's position is that Buyer is responsible for any taxes at or 
after delivery.  Future Taxes are not applicable to a 3 month deal.
 9. All of the changes made to 12.2, 12.3 and 12.5 should be removed.  There 
is no partial force majeure, a party is either unable to perform because of 
the event or the party can perform.  Please explain how the loss of Buyer's 
market could be due to an event of Force Majeure and why the Buyer should not 
be required to find a new market during such period.  Force Majeure should 
only allow termination if the period extends for more than 180 Days and then 
it should only be a triggering event allowing the other party to terminate 
and collect a Termination Payment.
 10.   The change in 14 should be deleted.  There is no event which would 
allow early termination other than a Triggering Event.  
 11. Please explain the changes in 16.4.  Seller has provided all of the 
notice address information that will be put in the Contract.  No telephone 
number or other address will be added.
 12. All of the changes made to 17.1, 17.2, 17.3 and 17.4 should be deleted 
and the original language provided in my previous redline should be 
restored.  These are requirements set forth by Enron's credit requirement and 
are not subject to negotiation by me.  
 13. I have no problem with the changes proposed for 18.1, 18.2, 18.3 nor the 
addition of 18.4; however, I do not believe that either party would be able 
to locate qualified arbitrators who would agree to the shortened periods.  
Please reconsider.
 14. The changes made to the guaranty document appear to be acceptable and I 
would forward same to Enron Corp. for their consideration.

 Please review the Contract in light of the matters raised above and let me 
have your comments so that we can get this finalized as soon as possible.

Dan-

Attached is a redline document showing our counter to your redline proposal.
The majority of your changes were fine, from my perspective, with minor
tweaking (for example, timelines in arbitration).  The two primary items I
think we will need to discuss are (1) Taxes and (2) the definition of a
Material Adverse Change.  Please see my suggestions and then we can discuss.
As part of this discussion, could you please provide Enron North America
Corp's and Enron Corp's S&P debt ratings?

Please note that any changes we discuss will be subject to the final
approval of Wisconsin Public Service.

Please provide me with an estimated response time (ie, this afternoon,
tomorrow morning), so I can keep WPSC apprised.

Thanks for your help!

Dan,

We have previously provided you with hard copy of a rough draft of the 
schedule of purchase and sale contracts which support the Triple Lutz 
financial statements.  When assembling our data, we typically select a common 
counterparty name to attach to all business with those counterparties that 
have multiple entities - thus "Reliant Energy - Entex" in our schedule 
captures all business with the following counterparties:  Reliant Energy - 
Entex, Unit Gas Transmission Company Inc., Entex Gas Marketing Company  and 
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  The spreadsheet attached sets forth the exact 
counterparty name and contract type for each of the "Reliant Energy - Entex" 
contracts included in the schedule of purchase and sale contracts previously 
provided to you.  Please also keep in mind that the schedule provided to you 
only covers purchases and sales that hit HPLC's general ledger during the 
period from 5/99 to 4/2000.

Below I have attached the "Enfolio Master Sale/Purchase Agreement".  Please 
note that Exhibit C (ENFOLIO MASTER FIRM PURCHASE/SALE AGREEMENT-GUARANTY 
AGREEMENT) is no longer a required document to complete the transaction; 
therefore, please discard.

Please print and execute two copies of the Enfolio Agreement along with the 
two Transaction Agreements which should arrive via Federal Express later 
today.

Please feel free to call with any questions.

Thanks,

Chris

Christian,
 Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.  Please 
print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the purchase 
order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If the number 
is not available, them please delete the information requiring the number 
from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed copies to me or 
Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Christian,
     If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
your address for Invoices.

Dan,

Attached below is the confidentiality agreement from Coral.  If you may 
recall, you mentioned the last time that it would be best to simply execute 
the document that we had already executed previously.  Give me a call once 
you have reviewed.

Attached is the file for the confidentiality agreement we discussed

Resources Corp. signed back in 1997.  I did change the entity from ECTR to
Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries and affiliates as you requested yesterday.
Please review and let me know if this is acceptable.  If so, please execute
2 documents, return them to me and I will have them executed by Coral.
After they have been fully executed, I will return one original to you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I'm not sure what a traunch is but according to Mick Walters this deal has 
been in evergreen and this deal is a firming up (renegotiating) of the 
contract.  That said, it is basically a new deal to us.  We have newly marked 
volumes.

Sandi,

The deal David is referencing relates to an unbooked traunch under contract 
96001783.   This traunch had not previously been booked because the contract 
had had a price re-opening provision.  I'm fairly certain contract 96001783 
is already included in the data room documentation.

Subject: New deals on HPL

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

All of the assignment documents are supposed to be filed in the contract 
file.  Please review the contract file for these assignment effective dates.  
The date something is invoiced has nothing to do with the tariff filings, 
what is important is the delivery period and terms.  imbalance cashouts 
should be reported as such under the transport tariff, not a sales tariff, 
unless the transport does not provide for cash-out in which case a separate 
sales tariff needs to be set up to go with the Sales Contract which should be 
in the contract file.  Do you agree?

		 Subject: Missing Tariff Numbers on HPL Annual Report



Dan:  The following sales contracts were listed on the HPL Annual Report 
without a tariff number.  

Would you review the following information and advise as to whether a sales 
tariff filing is required.  It appears that the transactions related to these 
sales contracts took place prior to the time the contracts were assigned to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  Let me know if the tariffs we prepared to respond 
to the Auditors query, should truly be included with our November 10th TRRC 
Tariff Filing Report..

Contract #96022611:  H&D Operating Company - Gas Lift Sales:  Delivery period 
01/99 Invoiced 9/10/99; Delivery period 02/99 Invoiced 10/12/99.   HPL needs 
sales tariff for period after assignment.

Contract #96019866:  OXY USA. Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract: Delivery 
period 03/99; Demand Charge Invoiced 3/26/99.  Why shouldn't this be under 
the transport tariff for this transport imbalance.

Contract #96022610: Preferred Pipeline Company - GTC Sale Spot: Delivery 
period 01/99 and 02/99; Invoiced 08/27/99. Who issued the GTC, if HPL, then 
HPL needs to file a sales tariff.

Contract #96019865: Texcol Gas Services Inc. - Imbalance Cashout Contract 
(Contract was set up per Tommy Yanowski relating to the imbalance on 
Terminated Transport Agreement 12-88974-204  (311a2(284C)Offshore Tx); 
Delivery period 02/99; Invoiced 03/25/99. Cashout under 311transport should 
not require a tariff filing, however, it may require a FERC filing.

Contract #9600821: HPL Resources Company - Master Purchase Sale Firm.
Delivery period 01/99, Invoiced 02/12/99
Delivery period 02/99, Invoiced 03/24/99
Delivery period 04/99, Invoiced 06/10/99; 09/10/99
Accounting Summary Report of Manual Invoices recorded in the G/L for 01/99, 
03/99, 04/99, 05/99, 06/99, 07/99, 09/99, 10/99, 11/99 and  12/99.
Do you know when this contract came back to HPL and should the tariff reflect 
activity that took place prior to when it was assigned to HPL?  This 
information should be in the contract file.  The tariff should not  reflect 
activity prior to the time the contract was assigned to HPL.
 
I will need to get final information to Carla Nguyen by Monday October 30 so 
she can make the appropriate notations to the annual report pages 31a2, 31a3 
and 31a4.

Thanks for all your help!

Jeff,

I have been working closely with Southern Company on the sale of natural gas 
from Elba and/or Destin for 10 yrs.  Please note the attached Exhibits that 
Southern has drafted to our Gas Sales and Purchase Agreement dated December 
29, 1999.  Additionally, I have attached two proposals that summarizes the 
structure of the deal.  Pricing is still to be determined once we agree upon 
the language for your review.  Please advise as to a time that we may 
discuss.  I can be reached at x37912.



Thanks.

Debra -

Per your request yesterday, attached are the worksheets for the Master Firm 
Purchase/Sale agreements with Cross Timbers Oil Company and Louis Dreyfus 
Natural Gas, changed to the MASTER PHYSICAL worksheet format.  The major 
difference between these worksheets and those previously provided is that 
"Collateral Rounding" is changed to "Collateral Multiple".  Please let me 
know if you have any other issues or questions.


Thanks,

Lisa,
 Barbara Gray requested that I fax a copy of the subject guaranty to you for 
your review.  This guaranty was not included in the initial list of 
guarantees provided by the credit group.  Apparently one of the analyst had 
the file pulled and on his desk for review.  
 Barbara has also asked that you prepare a Substitution and Release Agreement 
for this guaranty.

 Please call me if you have any questions.  My phone number is 713-853-6895.

The information for Enron Canada Corp. - Engage Energy Canada, L.P. ("Engage 
Canada") looks correct with respect to the Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.  We are in the process of revising the amended and restated 
agreement between Enron Canada Corp. and Engage Canada.  It should be out 
shortly.

  NOTE:  I think Enron North America Corp. still needs a guarantee from 
Westcoast Gas Inc. to guarantee the trades done on the East desk between ENA 
and Engage Canada.  I believe you wanted that guarantee to be for US$5million 
and I assume that Dan Hyvl is taking care of it.

Thanks,

Mark

To All:

Attached is a credit worksheet required for a transaction with National Steel 
Corp that is being structured by the contacts listed on the worksheet.  This 
particular transaction is being executed in conjunction with prior long dated 
transaction with National Steel (TAGG#E79260).  A prepay  of the in-the-money 
position to the counterparty has been structured for part of the remaining 
years left on the contract.  In addition to this, a new transaction will be 
entered into in which ENA sells additional volume of nat gas to the 
counterparty along with what is already being delivered from the remaining 
contract.  A Master Firm Purchase Sale is required for this new transaction 
and the existing transaction MUST be assigned over to this Master in order to 
offset the existing MTM with the sales volumes.  The execution of this new 
transaction is dependent on the assignment of the existing transaction to the 
Master.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,
Haldor Topsoe has requested a maximum volume of 1600 mmbtu per day and the 
new deal will replace the old deal at a new price of 110% IF-HSC for total 
requirements with an end date of 8/31/2004.  
FYI we are putting about $120,000 of facilities in to this location and it 
will have a new meter roughly 800 feet from the old one.  I am not sure at 
this time if we will read both meters or just one.

As long as we have the Master executed, you can do the extension.

I understand the physical agreement is a must.  However, my real question is 
regarding a two year extension.

Gary the ONLY way that we can do these deals is AFTER the signing of the 
Master Physical Agreement.

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.


-Darren

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

 Credit has a hold on this deal.  As you are aware, we need a credit 
worksheet before we can generate the proposed contract.  If you can get 
Russell Diamond to issue a credit worksheet to me, I will be glad to start 
work on the request.

I have drafted and attached a basic offer to an adjacent land owner for a
property sale.  He and I have negotiated this for some time and this is
basically my final offer.

Please critique this letter and advise me at your earliest convenience of
the changes you would require before this is sent out.

As we discussed this morning, I have reviewed the subject agreement that you 
faxed to me.  As I indicated yesterday, if I had been provided to agreement 
for approval by HPL, I would have approved it for execution.  I still feel 
that we should always have a waiver of consequential damages provision in the 
agreements, however, as I indicated to Mitch, the risk of such damages is 
very minimal.  I think the resolution that you, Stacey and Mitch worked out 
by changing the term to monthly is excellent.  This will allow you to replace 
the agreement in the future when TXU has developed it new form.  Please call 
me if you need anything further regarding this matter.

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

Please review the attached revised document.  I left the references to
Louisiana in the document because of all the changes to section numbers and
exhibits that deletion of that section would cause.  At some time in the
future, I will modify to delete, but it should be okay with the references
left in for the time being.  Additionally, I suspect that we may need to
leave it in because we may need to generate a version for the LEG system
that AEP has in Louisiana.  Let me know if you think we need any other
changes.

Gerald/Eric-

I have a couple of questions regarding TGLO transport contract 
012-88494-202.  We are currently delivering a volume of 28.000mm into various 
Midcon interconnects on this contract that are designated to go to 
Reliant/Entex for the purpose of heating HISD schools.  The transport 
contract stipulates different rates for this delivery depending on whether 
the gas is intended for state facilities or not.  My first question, then, 
is:  are HISD schools considered state facilities?  And, if HISD schools are 
considered state facilities, does the fact that this gas is being delivered 
to them via Reliant/Entex utilizing Midcon's pipe make any difference?

I am asking these questions not only to assure that we are recouping the 
correct transport rate, but also to determine what the consequences might be 
if I interrupt this delivery.  We are having difficulty getting enough gas 
into Midcon to cover our Entex noms and I am just exploring my options.  I 
would also expect that this volume should decrease when HISD closes for the 
Christmas holidays- does the fact that this is an IT agreement give me enough 
leverage to cut this nom if TGLO does not do so voluntarily?

Thanks for your help.

Yates recently agreed (verbally to Brian) to the terms of the attached 
sheet.  I do not know if or when they will sign an LOU; however, as we've 
been doing with other customers in the interest of time, we would like to get 
Yates a first draft of purchase and gathering documents as soon as possible.  
Please call with any questions.  Thanks.

P.S.  F.Y.I., As you will see in this term sheet, Yates is installing their 
own first stage of compression (screw) and wellhead gathering, similar to 
Ind. Production.

NEW LANGUAGE
-Submitted by PATRICIA L GOONETILLEKE

The European Commission has just announced an agreement whereby English will 
be the official language of the EU rather than German which was the other 
possibility. As part of the negotiations, Her Majesty's Government conceded 
that English spelling had some room for improvement and has accepted a 5 year 
phase-in plan that would be known as "Euro-English".

In the first year, "s" will replace the soft "c". Sertainly, this will make 
the sivil servants jump with joy. The hard "c" will be dropped in favour of 
the"k". This should klear up konfusion and keyboards kan have 1 less letter.

There will be growing publik enthusiasm in the sekond year,?when the 
troublesome "ph" will be replaced with "f". This will make words like 
"fotograf" 20% shorter.

In the 3rd year, publik akseptanse of the new spelling kan be ekspekted to 
reach the stage where more komplikated changes are possible. Governments will 
enkorage the removal of double letters, which have always ben a deterent to 
akurate speling. Also, al wil agre that the horible mes of the silent "e"s in 
the language is disgraseful, and they should go away.

By the fourth year, peopl wil be reseptiv to steps such as replasing "th" 
with "z" and "w" with "v". During ze fifz year,?ze unesesary "o" kan be dropd 
from vords kontaining "ou" and similar changes vud of kors be aplid to ozer 
kombinations of leters.

After zis fifz yer, ve vil hav a reli sensibl riten styl. Zer vil be no mor 
trubl or difikultis and evrivun vil find it ezi to understand ech ozer. Ze 
drem vil finali kum tru! And zen ve vil tak over ze  world!

Dan,

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

Lets discuss.

Alan, here are clean and redlined versions of the above agreement.  The only
thing in here that we have not discussed  is language obligating Enron to
provide us with copies of their LNG agreements with El Paso so that you have
an opportunity to evaluate them before having to decide whether to take
assignment of them.

Call if I failed to capture everything we discussed correctly.

Good morning. We repeated the MMSE test this week. Mom did  much better this 
time. Still has trouble with short term memory, but she drew  the clock 
correct this time. It looks like the medicine is holding things okay.  The 
doctor talked with her briefly about banking needs and finances, so she  
shouldn't be surprised if we bring up the subject.? She (the doctor) told  
her that her concern was of someone taking advantage of her,(strangers, 
etc.)  since she may not remember that she had already paid for something and 
try to do  it again.
?Still planning to get together Sat. June 2. Mom thinks  she is going out for 
her birthday so I don't expect her to try to cook alot of  stuff. Let me know 
what is needed as far as food.
?Oh, Allison's tests also were better. The urinary reflux  that was seen 6 
months ago appears to have corrected itself. No surgery needed,  however they 
are still concerned about why she has had the frequent urinary  tract 
infections. Anyway she too is doing much better. Let me hear ffrom both of  
you.

Mary,
 I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning 
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the 
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the 
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable 
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute 
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a 
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default 
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if 
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have 
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting 
funding thereunder.

Dan,

Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK 
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the 
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and 
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?

Subject: PEAK Surety Reference Letter


Phil-Attached is a first round draft of a reference letter for the PEAK 
project.  Please review and let me know what changes are suggested.

I've made calls to several of the major sureties this morning to re-confirm 
the availability of long term/non-cancellable bonds.  Five years is the 
general ceiling.  We need to be careful  PEAK understands that if the surety 
elects not to renew at the end of the first five years, this does not trigger 
an automatic demand against the bond.  PEAK should already know the issues 
involved from the surety side based on previous negotiations they had with 
other energy marketers when this project was negotiated (without success) 
last fall.  This is not an Enron issue-it goes to commercial availability.

Call me with your comments.  Thanks.

Craig,
 Attached please find a revised draft of the Ormet Contract.  I have 
incorporated the language from the Credit Worksheet prepared by Jason 
Williams.  That language is included in Sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the Contract 
and in the definitions for Material Adverse Change, Guarantor, Funded Debt, 
Current Ratio, and Net Worth.  
 Regarding Amy Baird's memo, I have made the requested changes in Article 3 
of the Contract regarding changing "Schedule" and "Scheduled" to "deliver" 
and "delivered" and "receive" and "received".  I did not add the language 
requested in (iii) because that language is already included in the 
definition of "Replacement Price Differential".  I included the language she 
requested under (iv) as (iii) in Section 3.2  I omitted the last sentence 
relating to consequential damages of $1,000,000 per occurrence as we 
discussed and left in the language in Section 8.3 which limits the 
consequential damages to a maximum of $1,000,000 during the term of the 
Agreement.  Likewise, I did not delete the language from Section 8.3 
providing that the gas is being supplied solely on the express 
representations and warranties provided in the Agreement and that all other 
warranties are being waived.  I did delete the language relating to Texas law 
and sentence starting with "Therefore, the Parties agree that (i) three" 
because we had agreed to delete the language from Section 4.1 which set forth 
the method of determining a party's liquidated damages.
I added a sentence at the end of Section 8.5 relating to trial before the 
court with waiver of right to jury trial.  I deleted the language relating to 
arbitration in Appendix 1.  
As we discussed, I did not make the change to force majeure.  We need to 
discuss this.  Our obligation should be limited to having firm transportation 
on one of the pipelines with interruptible transportation on the other.  If 
the firm transportation is interrupted because of force majeure, our 
obligation should be limited to using commercially reasonable efforts to 
cause the volumes to be delivered via the other pipeline if there was 
available capacity on such other pipeline.  
 Please review the contract and if you agree that it represents your 
understanding, you may forward it to the folks at Ormet.  I will be out of 
the office on Monday, but will be available by phone.

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."

The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".

The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"

The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.

Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"

The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.

The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"

The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."

The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."

The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of

these puppies will have an owner such as you."

IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU

I do not know the origin of the Btu factor as stated on the annual report.  
Can you respond to Dan on this?

Steve,  
 Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of 
the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work.  
The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the 
measured mcfs including both purchase and transport?

iBuyit Payables Overview
When?  iBuyit Payables, a web-based system that will enable you to code and=
=20
approve invoices on-line, was activated on May 1st.

Who?  Invoices that were previously submitted to Houston Accounts Payable f=
or=20
processing and payment, will now be processed through iBuyit Payables=20
beginning May 1st.  Invoices that are entered into SAP locally (for example=
,=20
at a field location), will not be impacted by iBuyit Payables on May 1st.

How?  This is how iBuyit Payables works (for non-purchase order related=20
invoices):
1)  An order is placed with a vendor.  The vendor is provided with the=20
company name and number, the contact name, and coder's EID number.
2)  The goods and services are received and the vendor sends the invoice=20
(with the company name and number, the contact name, and coder's EID number=
 )=20
to the new PO box.
3)  Accounts Payable scans the invoice, enters invoice header information=
=20
into SAP, and electronically routes the invoice through iBuyit Payables for=
=20
coding.
4)  The coder receives an e-mail with a link to iBuyit Payables, logs into=
=20
the system with their PID and password (SAP/eHRonline password), and codes=
=20
the invoice.
5)  The coder should either forward the invoice for approval or approve the=
=20
invoice, according to the invoice review and approval guidelines of their=
=20
business unit.
6)  Upon approval, the invoice is finalized, posted in SAP, and paid.=20

NINE MONTHS LATER 

Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They  loaded up Jack's
mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a
terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the
attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night. 

"I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all
to myself, but I'm recently "widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the
neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house." 

"Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll, be happy to sleep in the barn. And if
the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light" 

The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled
in for the night.  Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on
their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. 

About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney.
It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that
it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski 
weekend.  He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you
remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski 
holiday up 
north?" 

"Yes, I do. 

"Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house
and pay her a visit?" 

"Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to 
admit that I did." 

"And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?" 

Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy.  I'm afraid I
did. Why do you ask?" 

"She just died and left me everything." 

(And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)

THE STRONGEST MAN

Ted walks into a bar and shouts out, "Who's the strongest person in here?"

The toughest guy looks at him and says, "I am the strongest person around 
these parts!"

Ted politely asks, "Can you help me push my car to the gas station?"



HE SAID/SHE SAID

He said... I don't know why you wear a bra;  you've got nothing to put in it.
She said...You wear briefs, don't you?

He said....Do you love me just because my father left me a fortune?
She said...Not at all honey, I would love you no matter who left you the 
money.

She said...What do you mean by coming home half drunk?
He said....It's not my fault...I ran out of money.

He said... Since I first laid eyes on you, I've wanted to make love to you in 
the worst way.
She said...Well, you succeeded.

He said... What have you been doing with all the grocery money I gave you?
She said...Turn sideways and look in the mirror.

He said... Let's go out and have some fun tonight.
She said...Okay, but if you get home before I do, leave the hallway light on.

He said... Why don't you tell me when you have an orgasm?
She said...I would, but you're never there.

He said....Shall we try a different position tonight?
She said...That's a good idea, you stand by the ironing board while I sit on 
the sofa and fart."

Pls apprise me of your status on the preparation of the bill of sale for the

to reserve the mineral rights, if any, in our agreement with the buyer.

I have whatever exhibits you need available for this document.  We would like 
to have it by June 1 to offer to our buyer.

Clement,
 Russell Diamond of the Enron Credit group would like Enron to issue to 
Engage (now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.) a blanket guarantee 
covering obligations of ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. without necessarily tying those obligations to specific 
contracts.  Do you have a form of guaranty that could be used for this.  I 
think that the guaranty would still have a limit ($25MM)?.  Please advise.

Russell,
 The below two documents are the credit worksheet and the contract 
relationship documents which you provided.  The credit worksheet states that 
the guaranty should cover ENA, EPMI, ECC and Clinton Energy Management 
Services, Inc. and additionally should cover the master energy agreement with 
EPMI.  Do we have a date of execution or effective date for such master 
energy agreement.  The contract relationship document merely states that the 
guaranty should cover the new master firm purchase sale agreement  that ENA 
is negotiating with Engage and an master energy agreement between EPMI and 
____.  No agreements of any type are specified for ECC or Clinton Energy 
Management Services, Inc.  Also, are any of the Master Swap agreements that 
ENA has with Engage to be covered by the requested guaranty?  I believe that 
we need to get together at your convenience and determine exactly which 
contracts Enron Corp. is to cover with the guaranty agreement being offered 
as a part of the security for the Master Firm Purchase Sale Agreement.  
Please let me know when you will be available to discuss.

Dan,

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

Russell,
 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Dan,

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Russell

 My contract admin approached me today and asked why we had no paper on UDS

transaction.  Here is what I will have prepared for you today:

Term:  August 1, 2000 - July 31, 2001
Price:  9,000 mmbtu per day priced @ IF-HSC less (.01)
  excess over 9,000 mmbtu per day priced at Gas Daily less (.01) two days

  less than 9,000 mmbtu per day bought back @ Gas Daily Katy low two days 
after flow

Bob, 
Hope your vacation was great.  I was up in Michigan and had a great time.  
There are a couple issues still to be worked out on the contract.  Please let 
me know and I will get an agreement drawn up.  

1)  Baseload Volume -   Based on historicals your average is roughly 9,000 
mmbtu/d with swing from 6,000 - 12,000
 We can work this two ways: 1)  Use 9,000 per day as baseload with swings 
priced @ a GD and undertakes bought back at a GD
     2)  You can nominate some number between 6,000 and 12,000 prior to bid 
week and this becomes your baseload        number.  With swings priced @ a GD 
and undertakes bought back at a GD
2)  Gas Daily price - 
 Since this is no notice swing we use HSC GD mid less (.01) for all takes 
over baseload quantity two days after flow.
 If  you take less than baseload quantity we buy this back at Katy GD low two 
days after flow.
 The two day after price is used in order to line up volumes with cash 
price.  I would find out on the day after flow of your excess take and then 
pay the next  days price to meet your needs, hence two days after.

3)  Term would be one year out of August 2000 with evergreen clause 
(automatically extends month ot month) with 30 day written notice of 
cancellation during evergreen term

Give me your input.

Thanks Again!

Dan,
At bottom of page is first run at contract.  Middle is changes to bottom.  
Top is summary.  Call if you have questions.

1)  50,000 a day firm @ Index  (.01)
2)    0-60,000  first of the month nomination must be received prior to the 
end of bid week (3 business days prior to end of month).
 Also priced @ Index (.01)
3) Swing:  First 20,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid +.04 two days after
     From 20,001 - 50,000 mmbtu/d priced @ GD Mid+ .10 two days after
4)Buyback:
 Any volumes flowing less than first of month nom will be bought back on a 
daily basis @ Katy Mid two days after.

Gary,

1. Backup swing - I can live with a two-tiered pricing structure for
no-notice backup swing service. Just for clarification the tiers and pricing
would be as follows:
 a) 0 - 20,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel, Midpoint,
two days after flow plus $0.04/MMBtu and,
 b) 20,001 - 50,000 MMBtu/d at Gas Daily, Houston Ship Channel,
Midpoint, two days after flow plus $0.10/MMBtu.

2. Firm Gas - The flexibility of the firm gas delivery is for plant
maintenance only. I can drop the maximum volume to 110,000 MMBtu/d but
that's it. Given our current maintenance schedule, the expected demand and
your nominated volume would be as follows:

  Month   Deer Park Demand  HPL
Nomination
  July 2000  207,000 MMBtu/d  105,000
MMBtu/d
  August  207,000   105,000
  September  207,000   105,000
  October  190,000    95,000
  November  210,000   110,000
  December  210,000   110,000
  January 2001 145,000    70,000
  February  165,000    80,000
  March   213,000   110,000
  April   108,000    50,000
  May   108,000    50,000
  June   213,000   110,000

If you do the math, the total HPL nomination volume is 33,485,000 MMBtu for
a daily average take of 91,700 MMBtu/d. The uncertainty is that the
maintenance schedule is dynamic and the above numbers are subject to
revision. That's why we need the flexibility.

3. Curtailment/Interruption - My expectation is that this is a firm gas
supply. If I need to curtail and/or interrupt, it would trigger the buyback
option and would count against my annual average. However, if you curtail
and/or interrupt the buyback option would not be trigged and my annual
average would be adjusted accordingly.

4. Nominations - your definition of bidweek is perfectly acceptable. Can I
make a nomination of 105,000 MMBtu/d today?

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Jim, Dan and Janet:  I would appreciate you all paying special attention to

Brenda,

Matthew reviewed Coogler's responses and brings up the following questions.

We can do one-of-two things at this point.  We can either add the Reliant
responses to our audit report as "Auditee Responses", or we can have Enron
provide answers and possibly have us do some additional work.  The additional
work is dependent on Enron's answers to the questions.

Please advise.

Subject:  Coogler's Response

Rick and Fred:

I hope things are going well up in Salt Lake City.  I have gone through all of
Bruce's numbers today.  I have come up with a few questions that Enron needs 
to
answer.

1. Reliant claims that in East Texas the cut off for complementary customers 
is
30 Mcf/ day,  does Enron agree?
2. Reliant claims that the "New Technology Contract" overrides  or is an
exception to the Enfolio Master Agreement.  Does Enron agree that this is a
legitimate exception?
3. Reliant claims that all off the industrial mis-classified gas in the 
Houston
Division is under "special contracts" with special pricing, and even though 
they
are using less than 100 Mcf /day they receive a lower price of 2.71 per MMBTU.
Does Enron agree that this is a legitimate exception?
4. In the Houston Division it appears that Louisiana Pacific only uses gas for
heating in the winter, about three months out of the year.  Is there total
divided by three to find their average usage, or is it divided by 12?  Bruce
divided by three, we divided by twelve.  They are a customer all year, and are
not a new customer, or a customer that has left.
5. Does Enron want to give Reliant leeway on the 100 Mcf rule?  What will the
actual cut off be?  Bruce backs out 137,000 Mcf that was close, but not quite
100 Mcf.

These are the issues that I see.  The first three questions are things that
Enron may have to ask Bracewell and Patterson.  We were not notified of any of
the special contracts that he mentions.  Let me know what I need to do.  If 
you
guys have questions for me, it might be easier if we all got on the phone and
spoke about it.  Thanks,

Matthew

My supervisor reviewed the agreement and found one error.  In Section 8.8
Confidentiality on page 5, could you add the word "transfer" after the word
"wire"?  Thanks! I promise this is the last change.

"The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any Transaction
and wire TRANSFER instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

Christian,
     I have included the Red-line language in the contract relating to
utilization of small business concerns.  Hopefully, the next thing I see is
2 originals which have been signed by CPS.

DAN:

Please find attached the force majeure provisions from the draft Sales and 
Purchase Agreement between Enron Marketing and El Paso.  This represents 
considerable effort to date to find a mutually acceptable alternative to the 
Term Sheet language I forwarded to you as well.

Rightly or wrongly, this language does not address the issue of "operating 
condition" as a similar concept to force majeure, specifically in terms of a 
performance standard.  This may still come up with El Paso, but I am 
certainly prepared to talk to the Southern Company about it and get their 
views.

I started to redraft the force majeure provisions in terms of Enron as Seller 
and Southern Company as Buyer, but it quickly exceed my capabilities, so I 
went back to the language in the Enron/El Paso arrangement and included what 
I felt was the appropriate comment in the overview, to the effect that the 
Southern Company should look at the combined provisions as representing what 
Enron would, in its own right, request as a starting point for evaluation.

Once you have had a chance to look at it and my notes and definitions, I 
would like to send it on to the Southern Company for their review (sometime 
tomorrow, if possible).

Sorry to have taken so long getting this to you.


Regards.
Les

PS - please feel free to make any changes you deem appropriate.  I see little 
incentive to write up the new force majeure language until we get a signal 
from the Southern Company.  I know they are looking for simplicity and I 
think we need to be directionally responsive.  If we agree corporately, then 
significant revision will be required in any event.

Subject: EL PASO MERCHANT ENERGY - Elba Island Transaction


	

Gentlemen:

The following provision is contained in Enron's binding Term Sheet dated 
October 13, 1999 with El Paso Merchant Energy:


"If Enron Americas nominates gas for transportation on the SNG pipeline 
system, (i) Enron Americas or an affiliate thereof must have subscribed 
(directly from SNG) to firm transportation on the SNG system for a term not 
less than the lesser of ten (10) years or the then-remaining term of the 
Agreement, (ii) the Elba Island Facility must be, and remain during the 
duration of such firm transportation, the primary receipt point for such firm 
transportation, and (iii) such firm transportation (in MMBtu per day) shall 
be for a quantity equal to the quantity of gas (in MMBtu per day) nominated 
in the Redelivery Notice to be redelivered to Enron Americas on the SNG 
system ((i), (ii) and (iii) collectively, the "Firm Transportation 
Requirement")."


Aside from the different possible interpretations of the language: "If Enron 
Americas nominates gas for transportation on the SNG pipeline system ...", I 
would like to understand your opinion on the ability of El Paso Merchant 
Energy to bind Enron to enter into an agreement with a party who is not a 
party to the agreement.  Is this legally enforceable?  After all, Southern 
Natural Gas does not have a similar obligation.

If it were to be legally binding, under what terms and conditions would Enron 
be obligated to enter into such agreement?  I am thinking in particular of 
the fact that Southern Natural Gas has received authorization from the FERC 
to enter into transportation arrangements at negotiated rates.  If we were to 
locate a customer that could be accessed by means of a bypass pipeline at a 
lower effective cost than the Southern Natural Gas full rate, would we be 
entitled to hold out for a discounted rate with Southern Natural Gas?


Please call me with any questions you have as you proceed to develop your 
response.


Regards.
Les

Dan, as per my voice-mail, I talked to Hunter and he confirmed that Enron
would notify BP/Crestar via e-mail by 9:45 MST of the contracts with
associated volumes. On the chance that Enron cannot notify BP/Crestar or
fails to take, and BP/Crestar incur penalty costs then Enron would pay for
those as per point number #2 below ie.,

[ (2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.]

Hunter agreed as long as there is a reciprocal clause that Enron is
compensated when BP/Crestar fail to nominate by the 10:30am MST Timely
cycle deadline and Enron incurs costs, then BP/Crestar would pay those
costs.

Crestar and BP both agree with the reciprocal cost provisions. Now it is a
matter of where the language should go. I think it should be in the Enron
contract.

Please advise if you agree and how we should proceed to include the
language in the Enron contract.

Grant, I think you need to get involved and explain to Patrice's people the
agreement we have in place currently. Mark does not give us the information
via e-mail on a consistent basis by 9:45am, however the agreement states
that. To date Crestar has been accomodating to Enron but once BP comes into
the AOS agreement the 9:45am deadline will need to become more formal.

Gentlemen, please advise what Enron's position is. I think Mark's last
comment on same makret veveryday would accomodate the defualt contract
number request we originally had in the agreement.

Patrice:
I am unable to commit to knowing what our downstream contracts will be by
the 10:45 deadline that they have set fourth.  In the event that we sell to
a market at the point and there is a long daisy chain involved we may not
get the ultimate downstream contract until 11:15 or sometimes even
intra-day.  I will make every effort to get the downstream info. to
BP/Crestar/Gulf Canada however, I do not think we should take penalties if
our markets are slow providing us the information.

The only solution would be to take our supply to the same maket every day.

Thanks,
Mark

Subject:  Crestar AOS assignment to BP


Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Christian,
     The below documents has been modified in the manner that you
suggested.  Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated
to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be
used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been
requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested
changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.
If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2
originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to
Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any
questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895.

Jim,
 I will work on the Transaction Agreement which will go with the Master Sales 
Contract.  I just go a voice mail from Credit indicating who was working on 
your deal.  I am waiting for a credit worksheet from them so that I can start 
on the Contract.  Once the contract is completed, I will prepare the 
Transaction Agreement.  I will need to talk with you cause I noted several 
omissions in the language.  Under certain conditions, the transporter will 
not allow the over supplier to resell the volumes, they may be merely cashed 
out.  Do you agree.  What is the Purchase Index?  Is it Inside FERC Henry Hub 
first of the month  or is it some other index or is it daily.  Let's 
discuss.  I will be here today and next week.  Friday is iffy.

Janet,

 Can you let me know what you find out regarding that $1 million dollar pmt 
to Entex for extending the deal?  The Transaction Agreement #4 & 5, the 
buy/sell, nets out to the $1million due Entex.  Since this payment is for 
extending the deal,  shouldn't the Transaction Agreement  be between ECT & 
Reliant Energy - Entex and not Entex Gas Marketing? I will be out this 
afternoon, so could you just email me?

Thanks,
Kyle

Dan,

On 12/29/00 deal # 548711 was entered into Sitara for a contract to be 
attached.  Within this deal there were Special Handling Instructions which 
read: "This is a firm, full requirements sale to Ormet.  Also served to 
Cypress.  Please use the Transaction Agreement prepared by Dan Hyvl already 
executed by Ormet, rather than generate a new confirm."  

I created a GTC Sale Firm for this deal because the agreement mentioned in 
red could not be found in the Global database.  Since the notes mentioned 
that this particular agreement was prepard by you, I was hoping that you 
could clarify if this agreement was circulated our way (meaning if it had 
been sent to the Global Contracts group).  Please Advise.

Regards,
Bridgette Anderson

Dan and Jeff,

Ormet would like to finalize this transaction by the end of this week 
(Friday, Nov 17).  Could you please make every effort to get with Amy Baird 
to resolve those two legal issues from her Oct 13th memo (items 3&4).  
Regarding Item 2 we agreed to a $1mm cap for the entire contract term.    
Also, the contract does not address any of the pricing terms of the deal.  
I'm assuming that this would be covered in the confirmation rather than the 
base of the contract   Could you please send a draft of the confirmation to 
Mike Cesario by tomorrow morning.  
I've sent you a copy of my proposal so you know the terms.  There's a few 
additional items that need to be included.
Please DO NOT include the pricing (NYMEX + .055) .  That's still being 
negotiated.

1.  Enron will warrant that we will have 15,000 of FT on Koch
2. Ormet pays the demand charge ($.05) on the transport on any volumes below 
15,000/d
3.  Volumes above 15,000/d up to 22/d will be supplied on IT.  We will 
utilize the same receipt/delivery path as the FT volumes in order to get the 
discounted transport rate.  If Koch cuts our IT, we will use best efforts to 
get the gas there on another path or on Cypress.  We will pass thru the 
actual transport costs if they are above the discounted FT rate.
4.  Ormet must supply us with accurate and timely consumption information

5.   If Koch declares Force Majeure on our FT,  we must use best efforts to 
get gas and transport on Cypress before we declare FM

6. This is a full requirements contract (we supply all the gas that they 
consume)
7.  If Koch's tariff changes and they go away from monthly balancing, then we 
will have a price re-opener.
8.  If Ormet's loads change significantly (i.e. new cogen) we will have a 
price re-opener.

Under FINANCIAL MATTERS: BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT in
Appendix 1, I propose the following revised wording since we are not able to
provide a purchase order number at this time:

"Invoices for payments and correspondence for this Agreement must reference
Buyer's Purchase Order Number if such has been provided to Seller prior to
the first (1st) Business Day following the month of Gas deliveries.  If the
Purchase Order Number has been timely provided to Seller, invoices which do
not reference Buyer's Purchase Order Number will be returned unpaid.  All
invoices shall include any supporting documentation necessary to verify the
charges billed."

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

Yes. I believe that is correct. I will review the documents with regards to 
true assignment to a third party beyond assigning to an affiliate. But the 
transaction was structured to give Enron complete commercial flexibility with 
regards to restructuring or renegotiating the contracts. The sale is a bit 
more than a restructuring but the remedy is likely to be the same. Either 
Enron will retire the outstanding amounts under the monetization or give an 
indemnity for any losses associated with the transfer. The banks will likely 
accept either. Could you give me an idea of when the actual sale (cash 
changing hands) would likely take place. If we close with conditions 
precedent that are not likely to be met before 2001, I am less concerned 
about the negative funds flow issue of prepaying the financing. Regardless, I 
would imagine the outstanding amount under those contracts is getting quite 
small through five years of amortization. Thanks.

Subject: Monetized Contracts

Joe,
 Yesterday when we talked, I noted that Enron is considering selling certain 
pipeline and contract assets, certain of which contracts may have been 
previously monetized.  This is to confirm that the contracts which were 
monetized as a part of CASH II, being the contracts with Union Carbide, Texas 
Utilities Fuel Company and Southern Union Gas Company, and the two contracts 
with Entex, a division of Noram Energy Corp. (now Reliant Energy Entex, a 
division of Reliant Energy Resources Corp.) could, if necessary,  be assigned 
to an Enron subsidiary and that subsidiary could be sold to a third party 
without necessarily having to unwind the prior monetizations.  Please advise 
if this is not correct?  I will notify you with the specific contract 
information if these contracts are included in any sale to a non Enron entity.

Teresa,
 I have reviewed the revisions to the VPP transaction with Charlie Otto.  We 
have a concern relating to the term.  The term of this letter should be for 
the period ending April 30, 2001.  The reason for our reluctance in extending

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

Troy,
 It does not sound like they were interested enough to even discuss the 
proposed changes.  I would have probably given them something very close to 
their paragraph 5 if we had ever gotten over the other items.  Some things 
don't happen.

FYI,

It is unfortunate that we lose business due to a simple confidentiality 
agreement.  Dan, I do appreciate your efforts with this matter.

Troy -

I appreciate the time you took to have Enron's legal department review the 
non-disclosure agreement.  Unfortunately, Silgan cannot accept the requested 
changes, and specifically the deletion of paragraph 5.  As a result we have 
decided not to pursue a business relationship with Enron.

Thanks again for your time.

Michael Vogt

Following our conversation of last week, attached is the draft of the 
amendment to the fuel supply for your review and approval.  As you may 
recall, this document became necessary after we became aware of the letter 
agreement dated August 12, 1996.  If you have any questions, please give me a

to the lenders for their review and approval.

many thanks

Debra, Dan, and Ellen -

Deal QZ2383.1, with Weirton Steel Corporation, is approved by Credit, subject 
to the inclusion in the confirm of specific credit provisions.

Debra:  This is the deal that we discussed late last week, where you had 
worked up an ENFOLIO FIRM CONFIRMATION (attached below) with the credit terms 
that I had provided.  Jennifer Shipos informs me that the estimated price per 
Mmbtu is $6.13 for inclusion in the commercial terms section of the ENFOLIO 
confirmation (actual pricing is NYMEX plus $0.31 basis).

Ellen:  Please send out the confirm ONLY upon receipt of the ENFOLIO 
documents from Debra.  The documents below are simply drafts, and can not be 
sent with the confirm.  It is imperative that the credit provisions are 
included in this confirmation.  Once you have received these from Debra, 
please send out confirm at your earliest convenience.

IF ANYONE SHOULD HAVE ANY QUESTONS ABOUT THIS CONFIRMATION, PLEASE CALL ME AT 
EXTENSION 53923.


Thanks,

Jay

The L/C draw was wired in for the full amount of $540,170.00 and will be 
applied to the A/R account of Cage.

At the same time I will have a termination dollar amount from structuring 
tomorrow by 10:30 and will forward it to you at that time.
We can then send Cage a letter for damages owed.

Thanks

and 3.4 from $0.15 to $0.015.  The rest of the contract was unchanged.  As 
stated in previous email, please forward two signed originals to me for

We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the 
Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you 
have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please 
send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday 
session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 
hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by 
Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various 
state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the 
Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the 
appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.

Dan, I offer my apologies once again for the delayed response.  It would be
nice if the California energy crisis would evaporate the away gas vaporizes
under normal atmospheric conditions, so that my work load could ease
dramatically.  But, no such luck.

With respect to your modifications to 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v), (4.2((vi), the
definition of "Act", the changes to "Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated",
they are acceptable.  However, at the risk of being a nitpicker, the word
"parties" in the language added to the "Arbitration Disputes to be
Arbitrated" paragraph should read "Parties."

Also, on or before the Effective Date, it would be appreciated if the City
could receive a list of the initial contact staff members of Enron who are
located on the trade floor.

For your information, the certified copy of the resolution no. 8040, adopted
March 12, 2001 by the city council, authorizing the city manager to sign the
Enfolio contract, will be delivered in the very near future.  I could fax to
you as soon as I get a fax number.  Please omit the draft resolution and the
deleted opinion of counsel in the final dispatch to me.  If the red-line and
strike-out changes [introductory paragraph, 4.2(iv)(b), 4.2(v) and (vi),
Act, Arbitration Disputes to be Arbitrated] could be removed, that would be
great.

The City has another inquiry.  The OFO language on page 2 of Appendix "1"
suggests that Enron is not responsible for OFO-related charges if it doesn't
receive properly or timely notice of an OFO condition.  Is this so?
Further, under what conditions would the City be required to give Enron
notice of an OFO?  Finally, EFOs are not addressed in this contract.  Do the
words "or other order or notice from a Transporter" in the Operational Flow
Orders paragraph contemplate EFOs?

I'm optimistic that we can wrap this up pretty soon.  Look forward to your
response to this e-mail.  Thanks, Grant.

Grant,
     Sorry for the delay in responding to your additional inquiries.
     7.   Re 4.2(iv)(b) - I would propose the clause to read:  "(b) file a
petition or otherwise commence, authorize or acquiesce in the commencement
of a proceeding or cause under any bankruptcy or similar law of the
protection of creditors, or have such petition filed against it and such
proceeding remains undismissed for 30 Days, provided if a petition is filed
against the Affected Party and the  Affected Party is actively pursuing all
steps to have such proceeding dismissed and provides the other party with
reasonable documentation supporting its actions to cause such proceeding to
be dismissed, then such Affected Party shall have an additional 30 Days to
effectuate such dismissal,"
     8.   Re 4.2 (v) and 4.2 (vi) -  "20 or more Gas Days" is acceptable.
     13.  I will change the definition of "Act" as you suggest.
     21.  I propose that language be added whereby the parties shall first
attempt to settle the matters to be resolved by the use of binding
Arbitration by mon-binding mediation and if that does not resolve the issue
to the satisfaction of the parties, such matter shall thereafter be
resolved by the use of binding Arbitration.  Is this an acceptable
resolution?
     22.  We cannot agree to any list of parties who are authorized to
enter into transactions under the contract.  Our position is that whoever
answers the trading phone during trading hours is authorized to bind the
company.  However, we will provide the City with an initial contact list of
the people on the trading floor whom the city can contact as of the date
the contract is signed; however, the persons who are authorized to enter
into a transaction with the city will not be limited to the initial contact
list.  Of course, the city could always attempt to contact someone on the
initial contact list.  Will an initial contact list be acceptable?

Please let me have your thoughts concerning the above.
                                                   Dan.

Agreement






Dan, please accept my apologies for replying so late.  I was out of town
again, and am back at trying to complete 5+ days of work within 3 days.

Thanks for accepting a lot of our requests.  Let me follow up with a couple
of additional inquiries.

7.  Re 4.2(iv), please suggest language as you've indicated in sentence 2.
Anything along the lines you've proposed likely will be agreeable.

8.  Re 4.2(v) and (vi).  How about 20 days?

13. Definition of "Act."  I suggest you refer to Article 11, sections 5 and
9 of the California Constitution, to be more specific.  Section 3 is not
regularly cited as the line of authority to the best of my knowledge,
though
I can see how the language could lead  one to cite it.

21.  In California, the concept of binding mediation is not recognized, if
I
have understood our outside counsel at prior mediations in which I've
participated.  Mediation is non-binding.  As a practical matter, it can
cost
almost as much in terms of time, money and effort to proceed to mediation,
but the "rules of engagement" are not as tight as are found in arbitration.
We avoid the rigid procedures.  I believe Enron should consider this
approach at times.  Having gone through a couple, I would not recommend to
my client that we would proceed any further once the mediator makes a
proposal that's acceptable to the parties.  The cost of arbitration is not
worth it.  That's why we in California tend to prefer mediation to
arbitration.

22.  I have to insist on behalf of my client that we assemble some list.
Surely, Enron can submit a list of people that will be initially approved
to
engage in authorized transactions.  We can do the same.  We've had an
unfavorable experience with another Texas-based
energy company regarding the scope of its representative's authority.  We
don't want to litigate the issue of due authority.  That list would help
It's not a matter of the city claiming the authority to back out of the
contract, because someone arguably didn't have the authority.  There are a
ton of cases which would make it extremely difficult to make that claim.

Thanks.  Grant.

>>
          (See attached file: 2001-002ctr.doc)

          Grant,
               I have reviewed your requested changes and have made
the changes which
          do not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes
are reflected
          in the above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
               1.   I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
               2.   I have left a blank for the date within the month
of March 2001
          when the contract would be executed by the City.
               3.   I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
               4.   Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit
in a
          Deficiency Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can
be handled by
          a party at a particular point.  I do not think their is an
omission.
               5.   I have added the word "reasonable".
               6.   The procedue for how the Termination Payment is
determined is
          provided, if the City disagrees with the method and values
provided in the
          statement and is unable to convince the Company to revise,
the statement,
          then the issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the
point that a
          Termination Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn
out period
          should not be necessary to attain closure.
               7.   We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither
party should
          be required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the
other party's
          obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add
language to extend
          the period if we had some documentation stating the steps
that a party was
          pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the
other party was
          otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
               8.   I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too
short a period.
          During a holiday period, one scheduling error could cover
the entire
          period.  Article 3 has language which provides a remedy for
a party if a
          scheduling default extends for more than 5 days during any
month.
               9.   The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated
entity and no
          separate rating applies to ENA.
               10.  I have changed "a" to "the"
               11.  I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the
duration of an
          event of Force Majeure.
               12.  This merely addressed the possibility of a
imbalance amount being
          due when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple
points, and the
          language would allocated the payment based on the amount of
the imbalance
          that a particular party may have caused.  I think the
language is clear as
          written.
               13.  The definition of Act was one of the items that I
had requested
          that you review and complete as necessary so that all
appropriate statutes
          were referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I
started filling
          it in using language that had been provided by the City.
               14.  I added the word "reasonable".
               15.  I have made the requested change relating to
GAAAP.
               16.  This is a late payment provision and as such a
believe that the
          provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I
have kept the 2%
          over prime language.
               17.  These amounts were determined by the credit group
and any change
          needs to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered
investment
          grade and I understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.
ENA is not a
          rated entity and that is why the language relates to Enron
Corp.'s rating.
               18.  The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not
change the
          requirements relating to the representations that we expect
the City to
          have made.  If the City cannot make these representations,
then we need to
          know that before we execute the Contract.
               19.  I have added the word "reasonable".
               20.  The party that has the Transport Agreement with
the Transporter
          should have the legal right to obtain the information based
on its
          contract.
               21.  It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.
We can agree
          to meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the
parties.  I am
          willing to discuss any changed language that you might care
to offer.
               22.  We have found that personnel of both our Company
and that of our
          Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable
and merely
          allows a party to back out of transactions it does not like
on the basis
          that the person who agreed to such transaction was not on
the list.
          Therefore , we object to any listing of approved parties who
can transact.
          We believe that each party should be responsible for the
actions of its
          employees and should stand behind any transactions that
those parties may
          enter into pursuant to the terms and provisions of the
Contract.

               I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in
all next week if
          you care to discuss any of these matters.

Subject:     RE: Enfolio Master Firm

Purchase/Sale Agreement






           <<0071988 RESO Enron.doc>>

          Dan:

          First, I've attached the proposed resolution which
authorizes the City
          Manager to execute the Enfolio agreement.

          More importantly, I need to inform you that our senior
management has
          reviewed the referenced contract; I have been asked to
present additional
          changes to the agreement for Enron's consideration and to
raise questions
          about certain of its terms and conditions.

          Let me start from page 1, top to bottom, and proceed to the
end of the
          exhibits.

          1.  There is the word "DRAFT" above the title of the Enfolio
agreement
          which
          should be deleted.

          2.  The introductory paragraph, line 5, should not contain
the words "1st
          of
          January, 2001."  It should be left blank, until the parties
have signed the
          contract.  Otherwise, the City will be in breach as of the
date it signs
          the
          contract, because Article 2, section 2.1 requires the City
to proffer the
          to-be-approved-by-Council resolution as of 1/1/01.

          3.  Article 2, Section 2.4, line 2.  The City (Customer)
wants Enron
          (Company) to confirm every recorded telephonic Transaction,
as defined.
          Therefore, the City requests the word "may" should be
changed to "shall."

          4.  Article 3, Sections 3.1 and 3.2, first sentence:
Buyer's Requested
          Quantity refers to the DCQ or MaxDQ.  Seller's failure to
Schedule the
          Buyer's Requested Quantity shall constitute a Seller's
Deficiency Default.
          How does a Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity fit into a
Seller's
          Deficiency Default if the Buyer's Requested Quantity does
not include a
          Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity?  What is the reason
for the
          omission?

          5.  Article 4, Section 4.1, lines 15 and 23:  Line 23 refers
to "reasonable
          attorneys' fees" yet line 15 refers to "attorneys' fees."
To be internally
          consistent, line 15 should say "reasonable attorneys' fees."

          6.  Section 4.1, right hand column, lines 3-4.  A statement
showing the
          determination of the Termination Payment will be prepared.
It's unclear
          whether the City is entitled to review and challenge the
determination
          before a dispute is referred to arbitration.  The City
should be entitled
          to
          receive a copy of the determination and to question it
before it is
          obligated to pay the Termination Payment.  Please clarify,
or permit the
          City to exercise these rights.

          7.  Section 4.2(iv) specifies that a Triggering Event will
exist if a
          bankruptcy petition is undismissed within 30 days.  Is this
(under
          bankruptcy laws) the minimum period of time within which one
may seek
          dismissal of a bankruptcy petition?  Please refer to the 11
USC section
          that
          backs up this provision, or change to 60 days.

          8.  Section 4.2(v) and (vi):  Please change "30 days" to "5
days."  The
          City
          is concerned with the number of days that Enron may be
permitted to fail to
          Schedule before a Triggering Event is triggered by Enron.

          9.  Section 4.2(ix):  this language discusses a default by
Enron Corp.
          (ENA's parent?), but no mention is made of ENA's default in
this regard?
          Please explain.

          10. Section 4.5, line 4:  Is "a Company" supposed to refer
to "the Company"
          ?

          11. Article 5.  The City is uncomfortable with the force
majeure provision
          as drafted.  It states that the parties must perform even if
a FM event
          (earthquake) would prevent either or both parties from
performing with the
          60-day period stated therein.  There is no such limitation
under California
          law in the absence of a contract provision to the contrary.

          12.  Article 7, Section 7.2:  Could Enron translate the last
sentence?  We
          don't understand it.

          13.  Appendix "1":  Act:  Please explain why Section 3 is
referred to?

          14.  Appendix "1", Claims, line 4:  Please add "reasonable"
before
          "attorneys' fees.

           15.  Appendix "1", GAAP:  This should read: "GAAP means
generally accepted
          accounting principles, consistently applied, with respect to
Company, and
          governmental generally accepted accounting principles,
consistently
          applied,
          with respect to Customer."

          16.  Appendix "1", Interest Rate:  Please delete "two
percent over".  The
          City has a AAA bond rating, therefore, the  City believes
the 2% over prime
          should not apply to it.

          17.  Appendix "1", Material Adverse Change:  What does Enron
believe the
          City's Net Worth to be?  The $400 million threshold is
mentioned.  Also,
          what is ENA's bond rating?  Is "BBB-" an investment grade
rating?

          18.  Representations and Warranties:  Because we have agreed
that the
          opinion of counsel will not be required, the reps and
warranties are being
          deleted.  But the "Representations and Warranties" is
nevertheless included
          in the agreement.  Item (i) should be deleted, because the
City has not
          undertaken a court search as is our custom and practice
whenever we issue
          an
          opinion.  We would like to delete "and (vii) it is not ...
Party."

          19.  Operational Flow Orders, line 8:  Please add
"reasonable" before
          "attorneys' fees."

          20.  Financial Matters, line 8:  What is meant by "to the
extent it has a
          legal right of access thereto and/or ...etc."

          21.  Arbitration, Disputes to be Arbitrated.  We do not as a
matter of
          legal
          policy agree to arbitration, but we will mediate disputes.
Is Enron
          amenable to mediation?  This process is less formal and less
costly in my
          opinion.

          22.  Authority for Transactions.  Staff would like the
Agreement to include
          a list of employees for Company and Customer who are
authorized to trade on
          behalf of their employers.  Could a statement be added to
this section to
          this effect?  Then, we could attach the list(s) as an
Exhibit C.

          Thank you so much for considering these issues.  There are
others which I
          hope to receive from staff next week and which I will
forward to you for
          response.

          Look forward to hearing from you soon.  I will be out of
town after today
          until Wednesday, March 7.

          Sincerely,

          Grant Kolling

DAN:

I am attaching that certain draft of the LNG sales and purchase agreement, 
for your information, that we discussed yesterday.  This would be the draft 
that would be the basis for a negotiated resolution of the transaction with 
El Paso.  I have excerpted the force majeure clause and attached it as well, 
in order to avoid your having to print the entire document.

If  we are unable to resolve matters through negotiation, then the force 
majeure language will closely resemble that contained in the term sheet, i.e. 
the langauge that you had at hand yesterday.  I think you will find this 
language more restrictive (from Enron's perspective, as  Seller) than that 
set forth in the aforementioned draft, since we were able to make certain 
beneficial improvements during the negotiation process.  Having said that, it 
may be further away from acceptable Marked-to-Market requirements.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Regards.
Les

Susan,
 Okay, I see the old contract and I know about one that is currently being 
negotiated. Is the one that I am  working on different than the one that you 
are moving the existing deals to?  Has one been assigned to HPL?

Debra & Dan,

We currently have two Master Purchase Sale Firm contracts with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  The new master (96055225) is being used for all firm trading 
(including EOL), and the old master (96001135) needs to be terminated.  I 
have spoken with the counterparty about moving certain long term deals 
currently riding on the old contract over to the new contract (re-confirming 
as required), and they are agreeable.  There are 10 Nov-Mar deals also riding 
on the old master.  The terms of the old master require only 30 days written 
notice to terminate, but I would like to send a notice of termination to be 
effective on the date those ten deals expire (March 31).

I've attached the contract for review.  Does legal draft a letter, or do I?  
Please let me know how to proceed.

Thanks,
Susan

"Oil" means crude off, condensate and other liquid hydrocarbons meeting the 
quality standards and specifications set forth in Article VI hereof.  also, 
do we even need this definition?
*****************************************
I don't think so--John was going to do a search.



"Payment Date" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR 
Business Day of the next following Month.  For example, February 28, 2001 is 
the Payment Date for the Month of January 2001.  i think this reads better if 
we say:
"Payment Date" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR 
Business Day of the Month following the production Month.  For example, 
February 28, 2001 is the Payment Date for the production Month of January 
2001.  
*****************************************
 Read Section 8.1 where the term is used for payment--it works as is.




 
Section 3.3. Enforcement of Production Payment Documents.  Seller shall take 
all actions as may be appropriate to abide by the provisions of the 
Production Payment Documents and enforce the provisions of the Production 
Payment Documents against the Producer.  Seller shall not amend any 
Production Payment Document in any material respect without the consent of 
Buyer.

once again, i think this should state, that consent is only needed when 
amending something that will change any of the items tied to the Confirm - 
term, price, volume...  we should be able to change capex, or even the oil 
vols... w/o consent.
*****************************************
As long as we are GP of Brazos or the Servicer, this is OK--we can advise 
them informally--"prior written" has been deleted and ENA will not care 
except as to the irrelevant revisions--but if we're removed as GP or 
Servicer, this will be better protection for ENA.



Section 4.2. Scheduling.  Not less than fifteen (15) Days prior to the first 
Day of each Month during the Term of a Transaction, Seller will notify Buyer 
of the daily quantities of Gas that Seller expects to be available for 
delivery to Buyer hereunder at each Delivery Point during such Month. No 
later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to Buyer's Transporter's nomination 
deadline for such Month, Buyer agrees to schedule for delivery at each 
Delivery Point commencing on the first Day of such Month the quantities of 
Gas which Seller expects to deliver in kind to Buyer at each Delivery Point 
during such Month pursuant to this Agreement.  Although Buyer recognizes that 
the quantity at each Delivery Point may fluctuate in accordance with the 
provisions of the Production Payment Documents, Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer immediately upon receipt by Seller a copy of any notice or agreement to 
change any rate of production or Delivery Point under the terms of the 
applicable Production Payment Documents. make this 3 Business Days
*****************************************
OK



Section 7.1. Price.  Buyer shall pay Seller for all Gas delivered hereunder 
each Month in compliance with Sections 4.1, 6.1 and 6.4 by making the 
calculations described below for each Transaction (after disregarding any 
Measurement and Allocation Inaccuracies), adding together for all 
Transactions all amounts deemed owed by Buyer to Seller and by Seller to 
Buyer during such Month, and paying to Seller the resulting net amount deemed 
owed by Buyer to Seller on the Payment Date for such Month as provided in 
Section 8.1 (provided that if such resulting net amount is owed by Seller to 
Buyer then Seller shall pay the same to Buyer):
i need to think about this, but i think in reality, ENA will pay to Brazos 
each confirm/deal separately.  but i think this is such a small, moot point 
that i won't pursue.
*****************************************
OK.



Section 7.1. Price.  under b: refers to Index Price - the confirm/transaction 
agrmt calls this the Spot Price.  this needs to jive.  
*****************************************
We're changing all references to Index Price to Spot Price.




section 14.1, make me the Notices person.  fax #646.3640 & 
joan.quick@enron.com
i'm not sure who you want to put for ENA - bob bowen's group?  if so, fax # 
is 646.4816.
*****************************************
I think we're putting both you and Shirley in Notices.  Dan Hyvl should know 
who they want for notice.



we need a transaction agreement for crescendo.
*************************
Yes, do we have one for St. Mary's?  Who prepared it?  Will they prepare the 
Crescendo transaction agreement? We need to make sure they work with this 
Master.

 


*****************************************
re the transaction agreement for st mary's [which is attached].  we need to 
specify somewhere in that agrmt that that is the st. mary's deal... per the 
confirm definition [see below].  so that one can figure out which confirm 
goes with which deal.
*************************
It's not attached, but yes, you're right--that would be very helpful.


  

"Confirmation" means, with respect to a Transaction, a confirmation letter or 
statement between Buyer and Seller, setting forth for such Transaction the 
applicable Effective Date, Contract Price, Index Price, Delivery Points, and 
Scheduled Amounts and a reference to the related Conveyance

*****************************************
also re the transaction agreement for st mary's, do we want the MaxDQ to 
state that?  what happens if 100% of the gas is down on day 5, and they want 
to make it all up on day 6.  i don't think we s/b limited to 25%.  ALSO, the 
agrmt refers to the enfolio agmt, which needs to be changed.
************************
We don't have a MaxDQ any longer.  The transaction agreement probably needs 
to be redone.  I don't remember seeing it, but I may have.  Please forward it.




Thanks much.

Teresa

The November 2000 contract is the new deal with reliant.  We need to verify 
that we have a master between HPL and Reliant Energy Services, Inc.  If not, 
the old contract needs to be assigned to HPL.  Certain deals that were shown 
to the purchaser of HPL included business being done with Reliant Energy 
Services, Inc.  That means that if we don't have an HPL master, we need to do 
one for them.  Two deals were shown as HPL, however, they may have been GTCs, 
if so, we would need to create a master, and if the old master still exists, 
i would like to assign it to HPL so that they would have a contract to use 
after July.  Call me if you have any questions.

Robert,
 I confirmed with the Transportation Desk that the designation "TETCO M3" is 
a zone designation that includes all points within the zone.  Therefore the 
language "and all downstream delivery on the M3" is not needed.  Please call 
if you have any questions.

Hi Stacy -

Dick Jenkins has expressed concern with the description of an EnronOnline 
location and wants an immediate revision.  The location description needing 
revision is the TETCO M3.  It is currently defined as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone M3.


Dick wants to ensure that the delivery shall also include any location on the 
M3.  Therefore, please advise as follows:

The transaction is for delivery at Texas Eastern Transmission Corp. - Zone 
M3, and all downstream delivery on the M3.  

We need to get a ticker item posted on the website as soon as possible.  

Thanks -

Rob

(weekend)

9:00 am - Crestar (Keyspan) determines economic viability and informs Enron
, by phone, of AOS volumes to Enron's central cash desk

(Patrice Thurston)
          *** The deal will be 'done' at this time as per the AOS contract.

          (Note --  Crestar is in the process of assigning a portion the
AOS contract to BP.  After this assignment has been approved by Enron,
               BP and Crestar will notify Enron of daily AOS volumes)

9:45 am - Enron informs Crestar (Keyspan)   { and BP after contract
assignment}  the contract numbers, volumes, pipelines, and other required
     nominations information
     - Crestar (Keyspan) {and BP after contract assignment}  will nominate
on Alliance to ENA

10:30  - Nominations deadline (1st cycle)

12:00 - Pipelines will (should) confirm all nominations

(all times are MST)

Michael,
 I have reviewed the assignment documennt.  I intend to make two changes 
which I hope you make in the copies that the other parties are signing.  
These being that the Assignment be effective as of April 1, 2001 and the left 
over reference to Alberta be deleted from Enron North America Corp.'s 
address.  I will attach Transaction No. 1 to the Assignment Document and have 
it executed by Enron.  If you will provide me with the fax numbers for each 
party, I will fax to these numbers.  My fax number is (713)646-3490.

Everyone;

Attached is a revised assignment agreement which we hope you will find
satisfactory.

Our hope is to have this agreement signed Thursday.  Michelle's fax and
counterpart execution clause should facilitate execution.  Let me know if
you expect any problems with execution.

The original Unit Agreement was described as follows:

Unit Agreement covering the Bammel Gas Unit, Harris County, Texas, entered 
into as of the 1st day of January, 1966 by Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company, called Operator, and other subscribers, namely, H. M. Harrell, Sr.; 
John R. Harrell; H. M. Harrell, Jr.; John  M. Robinson, Individually, and as 
Trustee of the Clayton M. Harrell Trust, and as Executor or the Estate of 
William Ehrhardt; Carlyle W. Urban as Trustee of the Harrell 1963 Trust; 
Werner G. Zapp; Claud B. Hamill; Doris Key as Attorney-in-Fact for John Fred 
Bahr; R. E. Smith; Letitia Zapp Morgan; Floyd Williams, et ux; Paul Kautz, et 
ux; Howard key, et ux; Garland Wilson, et ux; Ernest S. Sears, et ux; Doris 
Key, Individually; and Ella Koinm.  

First Amendment of Unit Agreement was executed by Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company on November 22, 1966 providing for additional escalation 
in the Minimum Volumes of Dry Gas from the Unitized Formation, as provided in 
Paragraph 6.4 of the Unit Agreement, effective after the 25th calendar year.

The Second and Third Amendments of Unit Agreement expanded the acreage 
covered by the Unit Agreement from 6,979.478 acres to 7,438.478 acres.  I do 
not have copies of these 2 amendments.  

At approximately the same point in time Houston Natural Gas Production 
Company conveyed an undivided 50% interest in the Unitized Formation to 
Houston Pipe Line Company.  The remaining interest of Houston Natural Gas 
Production Company was later transferred to HNG Fossil Fuels Company (merged 
into Enron Oil & Gas Company) and that interest was transferred to HPL 
Resources Company, which is a subsidiary of Houston Pipe Line Company.

Please call me at (713)853-6895 if you need anything further to describe 
these documents.

Dan,

I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
$115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

Sorry that you did not receive my e-mail of Sept. 9th with the attached
addendum.  We have reviewed the draft of the Enfolio Master Firm
Purchase/Sales Agreement and find it generally to be a good agreement.  The
attached file contains an addendum with three changes that we would like to
make to the contract.  The first item is merely a grammatical clarification.
The second relates to the fact that we typically do not get the annual
report out within 120 days.  This year, we got it out in about 180 days.
The third item relates to a requirement that we must follow as a municipal
corporation.

Although the purchase process has not yet been approved by executive
management, we wanted to get the contractual issues resolved so that the
agreement could be immediately put in place once the approval occurs.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at (210)353-3725 if you have an
questions about the addendum.

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

Anthony,

Sorry about this last minute change, but people keep finding some mistakes.  
Item 1 on the purchase contract list the contract number for Altrade should 
be 96058475 and not 96016597.

Hopefully this is the last change.

Thanks

Bob.

 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the 
deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no 
bill of sale is needed.

At Southern Co.'s request, I have set up a conference call for 3pm on this 
Friday (April 20).  Alan wants our comments to the agreement and will provide 
us with pricing that they think will work for the project.  

Dan, if you can conference in, that would be great.

David,
 As we discussed, the Note provision of the Contract Price section of the 
confirm should be deleted.  Since the $3MM is to be paid for all events 
except for a default by SMC under this confirm or under the confirm for 
theexisting FPL base load, it would make the document clearer to restate the 
commodity price without the $0.0126 per MMBtu consideration and add a demand 
charge provision to cover the payment of such $0.0126 per MMBtu times the DCQ 
times the days in the month, excluding any default by Seller regarding the 
sale of volumes destined for delivery to FPL.

Dan,

I provided all the information that you are asking for on the original credit 
worksheet I e-mailed to ENA legal on August 29.  You will notice in the 
comments section the Enron entities I wanted covered in the guaranty along 
with the Contracts that needed to be reference.  If you need a copy the 
specific contracts that need to be covered they can be obtained through the 
documentation group, or through 'Live Link' on our computers.  Please make 
note of the name change that has now occurred with respect to Engage.

 We need closure on the guaranty issue.  All of the guaranty formats you 
provided to me covered specific enron entities under specific contracts that 
were identified in the guaranty.  If you can give me the specific contracts 
for each of the other enron entities you want covered by the Gas physical 
master contract of ENA whose payment obligations to Engage Energy Marketing, 
L.P.you want guarantied by Enron, I will take the lead to draft the guaranty 
and have it forward to Enron Corp for approval prior to sending it out as a 
draft to Engage Energy Marketing, L.P.

Dan,

This is in response to my continued efforts with legal to make note of my 
intended priority of executing a Master Firm with Coastal Energy (formerly 
Engage US).  As previous e-mails below indicate and phone calls with the ENA 
legal group and Coastal, the draft has yet to be sent out.  I have confirmed 
with Coastal today, they have STILL not received the draft although are 
expecting this from ENA.  We have outstanding exposure with this entity and 
is important from a credit, legal, and contractual standpoint that an 
agreement is executed.  I understand that in the past they have been 
unwilling to negotiate a Master although I want one put in place. Please do 
what you need to, to get this draft sent to the counterparty.

Regards,
Russell

Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this 
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's 
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to 
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......  

Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading 
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past, 
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their 
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please 
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and 
priortize the negotiation of this contract.

Steve,  
 Assuming that the system btu reported annually is representive of the Btu of 
the gas being purchased, the procedure that you have set forth will work.  
The question is how is the system btu determined?  Is it a total recap of the

I do not think that we can make the determination of which storage or 
transportation agreements may need to be assigned by refering to the 
counterparty name.  Each agreement file will need to be reviewed to determine 
its purpose.  Then depending on its purpose, the agreement will either remain 
with HPLR, ECT, be terminated or assigned, if permitted.  Therefore, please 
have the file room pull the agreements and send them to me for my review.

Thanks for the help Dan.  I didn't know if Jeff was in today or not.  I will 
forward Jeff's version to you for reference purposes.   I think the best 
course of action is to mark up their form with the changes we would need and

George,
 I am not sure what language Jeff had proposed; however, I would note that 5 
years from disclosure is too long.  I would suggest that the period be 
shortened 3 years from the date of  the agreement or 2 years from 
disclosure.  The choice of law as New Jersey is also a problem, I would 
prefer Texas or New York.  Also, the correct name for ENA is Enron North 
America Corp.  Please let me know how you want to respond to their draft of 
the document.

Dan,
Can you compare this CA sent to us by PSE&G to the standard one Jeff had sent 
them?

Dan and Greg,

Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.

Thanks--

Peter and Dan--

TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.

I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
currently have out to them.



Thank you,

Veronica Espinoza

So you only email me when you want something.  No, I do not know what I am 
going to do.  They tell me Time Warner Cable Modem service is not available 
in my area, however, Time Warner tells me it is.  They tell me that I can 
sign up for DSL and expense it on my expense account until they allow it 
sometimes next month.  I guess I need to talk with them some more about which 
is better.  People tell me the cable modem service is actually faster than 
the response we currently have in the office.  Let me know what you decide to 
do, so that I can ponder the reasons for your choice.

     Attached is an electronic version of the final Gas Purchase Agreement
     between ECT and FPL.  As I explained to Ozzie, this version is for
     your own internal purposes only.  Due to past experience with
     different printers causing a difference in pagination in the document,
     this electronic version should not be printed out and used as a
     version of the Agreement.  Two copies of the "official" document are
     being sent to you via express mail and should arrive before 12:00 noon
     today.  This "official" document is the document that will be executed
     and should be distributed as the final agreement.  Nevertheless, I
     thought it might be helpful for you to also have the agreement in an
     electronic format.

     Please call if you have any questions.  We look forward to closing the
     deal, as, I expect, do you!

     Thanks.

     Debra

Scott - Attached are my notes of the OUC deal that Jared thought you would 
like.  

Dan - We need to incorporate the terms and conditions that I have mentioned 
in the summary below into a confirmation sheet.  I'm assuming we have a 
Master Firm Agreement with Orlando Utilities, but if we don't, we need to get 
a contract drafted as well.  I will check in with you to discuss.

Thanks.

Christian,
 I have made the change to Section 8.8 as requested in the attached contract 
document.  You are correct about the second item, it is intended that the 
Purchase Order Number be a part of the address to be included on any invoice 
that is issued to the company.  This is absolutely the only way that we have 
to include the Purchase Order Number on any statements.  Therefore, i have 
not removed that line from the address,  At such time as the Purchase Order 
Number is available, please send a revised address notice to the company 
containing such number.  Until that happens, it will be understood that no 
number has been provided.  Please call if you have any questions.

Mr. Hyvl,

I just now had a chance to make a final review of the contract and noticed a
couple of items:

1.  Section 8.8. Confidentiality (page 5)

"and wire instructions" was inserted in the wrong place.  Could you change
it to read:  "The provisions of the Agreement, other than the terms of any
Transaction and wire instructions, are not subject to this confidentiality
obligation."

2.  Exhibit "A"  Customer Invoices

Under the address for CPS invoices, you inserted "Purchase Order Number
_________."  Since we do not know at this time what the purchase order
number will be, could we delete this.  Otherwise, it looks as if the
purchase order number is supposed to be part of the address.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at (210)353-3725.
Thanks ...

Ed,
 I am still waiting for you to tell me which Deal Person is the contact for 
the counterparty.  I need the Deal Person to initial the contract before an 
officer will sign.  If I send it to Scott Neal or one of the other desk 
heads, they will want the deal person to initial before they sign.  
Therefore, I am still waiting on you to tell me who trades with this 
counterparty.  I am holding the contract for that person.  If it is someone 
on the HPL desk, then we have to start over because you requested that the 
contract be done in ENA's name.

Subject: St. Mary's VPP - Texas Gas Operational Flow Order [OFO]


St. Mary's gas flows on Texas Gas [TGT].  

On January 26th, TGT issued a Critical Notice, that in essence states that 
they will not accept a nom to flow gas if it doesn't meet certain pipeline 
spec criteria - they will not accept gas over 1050 Btu content.  St. Mary's 
gas is around 1085 Btu.  Thus, this gas will have to be processed at the 
downstream Eunice Plant, or it will be shut in, starting either Monday the 
26th, or March 1st - this is uncertain right now.  I am working with Charlie 
Otto [Fred's group] and Jay Hartman/Brad Strong to put a processing contract 
together.  Charlie has/or is working on a processing contract with Hunt 
[operator] and this contract will be pretty much the same as Hunt's 
processing contract.  Since gas HAS TO be processed in order to flow, there 
is not much negotiating that will be done.

Since the price of gas is high [and producers do not want to process] , in 
the last couple months, there have been several pipelines to issue OFO's re 
Btu content.  This is the first time that I know of that this has ever been 
such an issue.

Terms of the processing contract:  $0.10 fee, shrink/PVR will be about 12%, 
producer keeps 100% of the NGL's.  Per Charlie, he thinks that this 12% 
shrink/100% liquids equates to a $0.05 or $0.06 loss.  Thus, the cost of 
processing is expected to be around $0.15 to $0.16.  The processing contract 
will be month to month and used only when it is mandatory under the OFO.

St. Mary's will be responsible for all fees, and shrink.  As an example, if 
100 is flowing at the wellhead, and 60 is VPP.  then, there will be 60 as 
VPP, 12 as PVR/PTR [shrink], and 28 as excess gas.  

St. Mary's would like the processing contract in ENA's name, since ENA should 
have title to the gas as it goes thru Eunice, and would just reimburse ENA 
for the 10 cent fee, or any other actual applicable fees.  Teresa - can you 
put something together re this reimbursement.  Charlie sees no problem in 
putting this in ENA's name, if someone sees an issue with this, please let me 
know ASAP.

George, Melissa, Lia - we will need to start nom'ing PVR/PTR.

Chris Germany - do we need a PTR contract on TGT?

Teresa - per the Production & Delivery Agrmt, it states that St. Mary's 
cannot process their gas.  We will need a waiver to this section 4, for the 
time period that processing is mandatory.  

Lia, George, John - the OFO notice came out on January 26, and I heard about 
this via Charlie today, is there some way in the future we can be notified 
more quickly about possible issues re the flow of any of our VPP gas?

Charlie will get his first draft of the contract on Friday and will work with 
myself and Jay/Brad to get this put together on Friday, in case this OFO does 
go into effect on Monday.

Anyone with any questions or concerns, please contact me immediately.

joan

I am waiting on your response to my voice mail regarding the assignment to 
BP.  Shouldn't we break the confirm into two documents, covering 42% of the 
entitlements to Crestar and 58% to BP.

Here is another incident stemming from the A-S 30 inch pipeline rupture of 
December 4, 2000.  Although the facts are still being developed, this 
customer was also being supplied off of the A-S line and when it went down, 
HPL had to activate another pipeline to serve this customer from a different 
source or direction.  This line may have had some liquids settled in the line 
or other sediments which became dislodged and ultimately may have caused a 
failure at Ameripol's boiler.  This resulted in a fire which they claim 
caused equipment and product damages.  Liquids are not identified in the 
quality specifications for the gas to be delivered to Ameripol, only not more 
than 20 grains of sulfur or 7 pounds of water vapor.
Additionally, the contract does contain a waiver of consequential damages.  
Gary indicated to me that they told him that about $130,000 of the loss was a 
result of lost sales due to the inability to produce product.  They have 
faxed us a written demand or notification which I will forward as soon as I 
receive it.

There is a second document that Stacey was working on that is pretty much 
identical as the Monthly firm deal but involves only gas on Alliance called 
AOS ( this is like Interuptable gas, but a little different ). The confirms 
has been raised previously, and you should have this on file. 

This is the file name on the bottom of Stacey's last document.  
o:\common\legal\sdickson\agreements\crestarspotcnfm.doc. 

Let me know... 

PS . did you send the confirm to Crestar on the firm volumes. BT

Select Energy is ready to execute this netting agreement.  They are just 
wanting to change the governing law to New York--are you okay with that (so 
that we can have this executed ASAP)???

Vernica-

I just called and left a message for you.

Attached is the netting agreement you sent to me via email with Select
Energy's information.  We have one request for the netting agreement.  We
would like to have the choice of law be New York.  I have made that change.

If this is acceptable to you, we will go ahead and execute the netting
agreement and I can fax it to you today.

Please let me know.

Ellen,
     I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to

Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.

CHOOSING A NEW  BATHING SUIT

Apparently a true e-mail a woman wrote to  her friend after shopping for
a bathing suit.

I have just been through the annual pilgrimage of torture and
humiliation known as buying a bathing suit.  When I  was a child in the
1950's, the bathing suit for a woman with a  mature figure was designed
for a woman with a mature, figure  - boned, trussed and reinforced, not
so much sewn as engineered. They were built to hold back and uplift and
they did a good job.

Today's stretch fabrics are designed for the pre-pubescent  girl with a
figure carved from a potato chip.  The mature  woman has a choice - she
can either front up at the  maternity department and try on a floral
suit with a skirt, coming away looking like a hippopotamus who escaped
from Disney's Fantasia - or she can wander around every run-of-the-mill
department store trying to make a sensible choice from what  amounts to
a designer range of fluorescent rubber bands.

What choice did I have?  I wandered around, made my  sensible choice and
entered the chamber of horrors known as the  fitting room.  The first
thing I noticed was the extraordinary  tensile strength of the stretch
material.

The  Lycra used in bathing costumes was developed, I believe, by NASA to
launch small rockets from a slingshot, which give the added bonus that
if you manage to actually lever yourself into one, you are protected
from shark attacks.  The reason for this is  that any shark taking a
swipe at your passing midriff would  immediately suffer whiplash.

I fought my way into the  bathing suit, but as I twanged the shoulder
strap in place, I  gasped in horror - my bosom had disappeared!
Eventually, I found one bosom cowering under my left armpit.  It took a
while to  find the other.

At last I located it  flattened beside my seventh rib.  The problem is
that   modern bathing suits have no bra cups.  The mature woman is meant
to wear her bosom spread across her chest like a speed  hump.

I realigned my speed hump and lurched toward the  mirror to take a full
view assessment.  The bathing suit fit  all right, but unfortunately, it
only fit those bits of me  willing to stay inside it.  The rest of me
oozed out rebelliously from top, bottom, and sides.  I looked like a
lump of  play dough wearing undersized cling wrap.

As I tried to work out where all those extra bits had come from, the
pre-pubescent sales girl popped head through the curtains, "Oh There you
are!" she said, admiring the bathing suit...I replied that I wasn't so
sure and asked what else she had to show me.

I tried on a cream crinkled one that made me look like a lump  of
masking tape, and a floral two piece which gave the appearance  of an
oversized napkin in a serviette ring.  I struggled into  a pair of
leopard skin bathers with ragged frill and came  out looking like
Tarzan's Jane pregnant with triplets and having a  rough day.

I tried on a black number with a midriff  and looked like a jellyfish in
mourning.  I tried on a bright  pink pair with such a high cut leg I
thought I would have to wax my  eyebrows to wear them.

Finally, I found a suit that  fit...a two piece affair with shorts style
bottom and a loose  blouse-type top.  It was cheap, comfortable, and
bulge  friendly, so I bought it.

When I got home, I read the  label which said "Material may become

transparent in water." I'm  determined to wear it anyway...I'll just
have to stay out of  the water!

A husband and wife  were having dinner at a very fine 
restaurant when this absolutely stunning  young woman came over to 
their table, gave the husband a big open-mouthed  kiss, said she'd see 
him later, and walked away. The wife glared at her  husband and said, 
"Who 
the hell ?was ?that?" 
"Oh," replied  the husband, "she's my mistress." 
"Well, that's the last straw," said the  wife. 
"I've had enough, and I want a divorce!" 
"I can understand that,"  replied her husband, "but 
remember, if we get a divorce it will mean no more  shopping 
trips to Paris, no more wintering in Barbados, no more summers in  
Tuscany, no more Infiniti or Lexus in the garage, and no more yacht  
club. But the decision is yours." 
Just then, a mutual friend entered the  restaurant with a 
gorgeous babe on his ?arm. 
"Who's that woman with  Jim?" asked the wife. 
"That's his mistress," said her husband. 
"Ours is  prettier," she replied.

Dave,
 I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the 
agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for 
this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a 
credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract.  
Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components 
is proceeding.

 That is correct.  If ENA wants to trade with Coral, It will need to use its 
Firm GTC and document accordingly until a new contract is negotiated with 
Coral.

Hi Dan,

I have a copy of a letter dated 8/2/99 from ECT to Coral Energy Resources, 
L.P. assigning the referenced contract to Houston Pipe Line Company.  The 
assignment was never made in Global Contracts.

If you agree that it should have been assigned, as the letter says, I will 
assign it today.  If I do assign it, Coral will no longer have a firm master 
contract for trading.  I will also have to remove it from EOL.

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Thanks!

 Spoke with credit and they are permitting us to go forward without adding 
credit provisions.  In reviewing your email, are both of the existing deals 
being modified for the period Feb  through July.  your chart says half for 
each deal.  I will do a new GTC confirm that terminates the old and rolls the 
old volumes and new pricing for the period FEb 01 through Jan O2.  Please 
give me a call (713) 853-6895.

That's great Dan, the extension is actually only 6 months (Aug 01 - Jan 02).  
Also, can we make it an "ammendment" to the existing deal?

DAve,
 Once you decide which way you would like to go, We will issue a new 
Confirmation Letter which will cancel the two previous confirmation letters 
effective as of February 1, 2001.  Because the term extends some 17 months, 
we will require them to sign the confirmation letter with attached GTC.  Let 
me know, and I will generate.

I have a proposed restructuring transaction with City of Mesa, Arizona.  It 
works like this:

1) Half their volume is currently priced at 3.74 (fixed, physical deal with 
us)
2) That deal runs through July 01
3) I want to reprice that deal at a higher price and use that equity to 
finance a discount to index for an extra six months.
4) They will do one of two transactions (shown below) one extends half the 
volume one extends the full volume.


       

I need help with a couple of things:

1) Since they canceled their Enfolio Agmt. can I get a contract from legal 
that will allow us to transact without it.
2) How do we get this deal in Mike's book and the risk system

Thanks,

Dave Fuller

Dan,

I realize that the collateral language has been in the contract throughout 
our negotiations.  However, our VP of credit only recently reviewed the 
contract.

His concern is that, with a collateral limit of only $1.5 million, Ormet 
would be exposed to having to post a LOC every month with natural gas prices 
where they are currently.

I suggested to Craig that we make it $10 million, consistent with Enron's 
collateral limit.  I realize that Enron's credit group ultimately needs to 
decide on an amount.  $10 million my be a bit too high, but $1.5 million is 
too low.

Let me know if you have any further questions.

Thanks,
Mike

Mike,
     I have reviewed the requested changes to Exhibit D, I am okay with the
proposed changes so long as the same changes are made to Exhibit C.  The
change to Suspension of performance on Appendix 1 is okay.  The collateral
requirement language has been in the contract for some time so I am
concerned with bringing up changes at this late date; however, please let
me know your concern so that we can resolve the issue with the Enron Credit
group.

Attached is a copy of Ormet's mark-up to the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement
post V.P. of Finance review.  The changes are primarily to Exhibit D.
Additionally, there is one chage under Suspension of Performance on
Appendix 1 page "1"-3.  Finally, we need to address the collateral
requirment/termination payment threshhold in section 4.3.
Thanks,
Mike

Dan,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
sent out to the field for most of the day.

Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
legal description.

Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
in place if it so chooses.

Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

Robert,
 Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

Dan,

I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
language most favorable to HPL.

Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.

Thanks!!!

 I am still waiting on the Credit Worksheet so that I can draft the 
agreement.  The Houston credit group claims that they have no request for 
this.  Please verify with the Credit Group so that  they would provide a 
credit worksheet directly to me for use in preparation of the contract.  
Otherwise, let me know how your negotiations on the transactions components 
is proceeding.

Dan:

Will Enovate cause us to become "undone" or what?  Today, one of our
Accountants asked me to change the address for Enovate to the Enron,
Houston address.  Just the day before, I had set contracts up in our gas
management system and used the Notices/Correspondence/Invoices section from
the Enovate contract to complete the areas of the contract that would feed
the Accounting module as well as the Contracts module, this being the
Chicago, Illinois information.  So, I politely told the Accountant that the
info in the gas management system was correct as entered.  He (the
Accountant) had spoken with an Accountant from ENA (Doug Nelson at
713/853-0560) and Doug told him that the invoices, etc. should go to
Enovate c/o Enron at 1400 Smith, Room EB3718, Houston, TX 77002.  Do you
have any objection to changing this in the contract?  Please advise, we'd
like to do what would best streamline this process.

Well Dan, hopefully, this will be ironed out one day soon and everything
will run smoothly.  Thanks again for your help.

Regards,
Ellen

Subject:  Enovate, L.L.C. Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

transactions) on a timely basis to the business units.  Every effort should 
be made to continue to provide high quality legal work that has become 
standard at ENA.

 1.  A written estimate of proposed fees and expenses and a written 
description of the services shall be provided by our outside counsel.  The 
responsible business unit and the General Counsel shall review and approve 
such written estimate before our outside counsel is directed to provide 
substantial professional services.

 2.  Our outside counsel shall be instructed to promptly submit a revised 
written estimate if such outside counsel determines that legal fees and 
expenses for such transaction will exceed the previous written estimate by 
$25,000.00.  Such revised written estimate shall be reviewed and approved by 
the responsible business unit and the General Counsel or his/her designee 
before our outside counsel is directed to provide substantial additional 
professional services. 

 3.  In order to accurately track such expenses so that the expenses can be 
properly allocated to the various business units, a work order number should 
be obtained for each transaction.  

 Thank you for your cooperation.  If you have any questions or any other 
suggestions for controlling expenses, please call me at extension 36544.

Mike, We have struck out on finding any agreement with the named entities.  
Did you forward a copy of the complaint to Richard Sanders, if not please 
forward to either Richard or to me and I will get it to Richard.  Maybe their 
is something in the complaint which will aid us in determining how ECT is 
paying on this deal which we have been unable to identify so far.  Dan

Mike,
 Jeff has forwarded your request to me.  A search of our data base has failed 
to identify the named wells or any contracts with the named individuals.  Can 
you provide any other information?

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

Dan, Brent, Shari -

Please let me know as soon as possible what the status of your review of the 
True Quote site is as we are getting closer to the anticipated completion 
date of March 12 - Monday.

I have already prepared comments to the access agreements for the site, but 
need to have your comments, if any, to present all Enron comments.

Thanks for the assistance.

Dan, Brent, Shari - 

We have been asked to review the provisions of Truequote - a third party 
trading platform - on which Enron may possibly trade.  I have requested 
access for each of you to the site (www.truequote.com) and hope to have this 
for each of you a bit later today.  In order to get you started, I have 
provided the general product descriptions below.

The use of this system is in conjunction with another deal we are currently 
working on with Truequote which will enable counterparties to hit Enron 
posted prices and transact with Enron through the Truequote site.  

Timing on this matter is rather tight as we need to finalize all agreements 
and be ready to begin using the Truequote site on Monday, March 12.  
Therefore, please initiate a review of the descriptions pertinent to your 
area as soon as possible so that I can coordinate any comments you may have 
with my general comments to the access agreement.  Travis is also working on 
a piece of this deal and will be interested in your comments.

Thanks to each of you.  If you should need anything further, please do not 
hesitate to call me.

which exhibits need to be signed in conjunction with the firm purchase/sale 
agreement?  Let me know and I will begin getting them executed.
Thanks,

Mike,
     I have reviewed the attached marked copy of the transaction agreement
and have gone over the changes with Craig.  Please change the term "best
efforts" which was added in the 14th line of Item 1 under Other to read
"commercially reasonable best efforts".  This will keep the concept the
same throughout the document where we use the term "commercially reasonable
best efforts".  With this change, please print out two copies of the
contract and two copies of the transaction agreement and proceed with
execution of each.  Please call if you have any questions.

My Dear Thanksgiving Dinner Guests,

Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  I'm telling
you in advance, so don't act surprised.  Since Ms. Stewart won't be coming,
I've made a few small changes:
Our sidewalk will not be lined with homemade, paper bag luminaries.  After a
trial run, it was decided that no matter how cleverly done, rows of  flaming
lunch sacks do not have the desired welcoming effect.  Once inside, our
guests will note that the entry hall is not decorated with the swags of
Indian corn and fall foliage I had planned to make.  Instead, I've gotten
the kids involved in the decorating by having them track in colorful autumn
leaves from the front yard.  The mud was their idea.

The dining table will not be covered with expensive linens, fancy china, or
crystal goblets.  If possible, we will use dishes that match and everyone
will get a fork.  Since this IS Thanksgiving, we will refrain from using the
plastic Peter Rabbit plate and the Santa napkins from last Christmas.

Our centerpiece will not be the tower of fresh fruit and flowers that I
promised.  Instead we will be displaying a hedgehog-like decoration
hand-crafted from the finest construction paper.  The artist assures me it
is a turkey.

We will be dining fashionably late.  The children will entertain you while
you wait.  I'm sure they will be happy to share every choice comment I  have
made regarding Thanksgiving, pilgrims, and the turkey hotline.  Please
remember that most of these comments were made at 5:00 a.m. upon discovering
that the turkey was still hard enough to cut diamonds.
As accompaniment to the children's recital, I will play a recording of
tribal drumming.  If the children should mention that I don't own a
recording of tribal drumming, or that tribal drumming sounds suspiciously
like a frozen turkey in a clothes dryer, ignore them.

They are lying.
We toyed with the idea of ringing a dainty silver bell to announce the start
of our feast.  In the end, we chose to keep our traditional method.

We've also decided against a formal seating arrangement.  When the smoke
alarm sounds, please gather around the table and sit where you like.


In the spirit of harmony, we will ask the children to sit at a separate
table.  In a separate room.  Next door.

Now, I know you have all seen pictures of one person carving a turkey in
front of a crowd of appreciative onlookers.  This will not be happening at
our dinner.  For safety reasons, the turkey will be carved in a private
ceremony.  I stress "private", meaning:  Do not, under any circumstances,
enter the kitchen to laugh at me.  Do not  send small, unsuspecting children
to check on my progress.  I have an electric knife.  The turkey is unarmed.
It stands to reason that I will eventually win.  When I do, we will eat.

I would like to take this opportunity to remind my young diners that
"passing the rolls" is not a football play.  Nor is it a request to bean
your sister in the head with warm tasty bread.  Oh, and one reminder for the
adults:  For the duration of the meal, and especially while in the presence
of young diners, we will refer to the giblet gravy by its  lesser-known
name:  Cheese Sauce.  If a young diner questions you regarding the origins
or type of Cheese Sauce, plead ignorance.

Before I forget, there is one last change.  Instead of offering a choice
between 12 different scrumptious desserts, we will be serving the
traditional pumpkin pie, garnished with whipped cream and small
fingerprints.  You will still have a choice:  take it or leave it.


Martha Stewart will not be dining with us this Thanksgiving.  She probably
won't come next year either.    I am thankful.

Dan,

Delete the other e-mail I sent and use this one.

This is the latest and greatest. I changed Gatherer to Provider and Gathering 
Service to Field Services.

I deleted the last sentence in Section 5 - Pressures.  Let me know if this is 
a problem. This line was added to other agreements at the request of those 
parties.




Hope you had a GREAT weekend.

Mike

 This should be okay.  I would prefer that all GTCs in excess of 6 months be 
prepared for signature by both ENA and the counterparty.  Is this a problem?

Yes, this deal should go to AEP with the HPL transaction.  The reason there 
are no forward volumes booked is because they have a monthly election to 
nominate baseload gas daily priced gas or wait and nominate daily volumes 
priced at gas daily.  At any rate there is no way to know in forward months 
what they are going to take subject to contractual maximums.  If you have any 
further questions let me know.

Thanks,

Tom

I just did a deal with Panther and I would use the same contract with this 
additional language.

Period of Delivery: April 01, 2001 - March 31, 2002


add that either party can terminate with 30 days written notice
add evergreen language so the deal will roll after the one year term.


Thanks,
J


Is the commodity price at Katy tail gate or HSC?  It looks like the contract

Dan,
The Campbell county clerk refused to record the State of WY Lease because it
does not contain an acknowledgment.  The clerk, however, said that they
would record a certified copy.  The State Land Office no longer provides
certified copies of their oil and gas leases, ergo, we could not record a
certified copy of the lease.

If you want to record the lease, I'll have Gregg Colton at Pioneer Oil and
Gas send the original lease to you to be recorded as an attachment to an
affadavit of identification.  At this stage of the process, I think it more
expeditious for you to control that process too.

Short of recording the lease, you can confirm the ownership of the lease
through the WY Office of State Lands and Investments, Phone # 307 777 7331;
fax 307 777 5400; email slfmail@missc.state.wy.us.

EOW can send it for recording also as an attachment to an affadavit but the
recording process is slow in the county because of the tremendous volume of
recording transactions ie., 2 weeks plus.

Your call.

Doug,
     Can you please forward to me the other recording info that you have on
the Enernet lease so that I can update the info on the mortgage.  My
counsel in Wyoming indicates that they won't get me a response until next
week and I would like to put the mortgage exhibit in final form as quickly
as possible.  Please call me at 713-853-6895 if you have any questions.

Michael,

 I have reviewed the attached agreement and offer the following comments.

1. Change the reference to Consenting Party to read as follows:
  
Enron North America Corp. is a Delaware corporation having an office located 
at 1400 Smith St., Houston, Texas (hereinafter referred to as "Consenting 
Party")

2. Paragraph No. 5.  Please delete the last two sentences, this had some 
applicability when the agreement was intended to be a partial assignment, 
however, once the assignment is completed, Assignee will be responsible for 
making its own nominations each day.

3. Paragraph No. 8.  Please limit this paragraph solely to Assignor and 
Assignee, otherwise change the reference to the State of Texas.

 Please call if you have any questions.

       Dan Hyvl

Dan -

Per our earlier conversation, attached is a worksheet for a Master Physical 
with South Jersey Resources Group LLC.  I do not know the name of the contact 
at South Jersey to whom this should be sent.  Do you have that info???

As you will see, this Master will require an increase and extension of the 
current guaranty.  The guarantor, South Jersey Industries, must increase the 
guaranty amount to $7MM, and I would like to see them issue a guaranty with 
no expiration date.

Please call me if you have any questions.  Thanks,


Jay

DAN,

    THE LONG TERM CONTRACT IN WHICH WE DELIVER 10,000 BBLS\DAY OF E\P MIX

     TO WESTLAKE PETROCHEMICAL  WAS CANCELLED EFFECTIVE 12/31/2000 PER

     MUTUAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN WESTLAKE AND ENRON. 

     FOR THE LAST 4 - 5 MONTHS WESTLAKE HAS BEEN SHORT PAYING THE INVOICES

     IN THE AMOUNT OF $0.0025, WHICH IS THE PREMIUM ON THE CONTRACT. THEY SAY

     THEY DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD HAVE TO PAY IT ANYMORE SO THEY DON'T.

     DO WE HAVE ANY RECOURSE TO COLLECT THIS SHORTFALL?

     OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH WESTLAKE HAS ALWAYS BEEN STRAINED AT BEST.

     WOULD THERE BE LEGAL RAMIFICATIONS IF I JUST WITHHELD PRODUCT FOR 

     DECEMBER, WHICH IS THE LAST DELIVERY MONTH ANYWAY.

Dan--

After meeting with Quantum, I have attached some suggested revisions to the 
documents for your review.  We (me & Quantum) still have a couple commercial 
issues to discuss so this will not be the last turn...but we're close.

Let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Dan




P.S.  Thanks for your quick turnaround on Westport; I was very involved in 
the deal and know that our quick action was important to securing the 
dedication...[and its Mike's first deal up in Denver!

for the letter to Cage, the file is on my desk (an orange file labeled 'Cage

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell

Dave,
     As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for
the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is
the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant
delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore,
please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for
execution by Enron.

Per our conversation today, I made a change to the "exhibit B"
confirmation.
If you could let me know that it's OK, we will make change and execute.

Please review the attached document to see if it reflects the matters we 
discussed.  I continued Les's marking and added some red-line changes and 
removed some of Les's language which no longer applied.  It will take more 
than an simple accept all changes to get to a clean copy.  Let me know if you 
need a clean copy so that I can clean up the different colors and methods of

Kim,
 The language is awkward but okay.  Question, for weekends, Sat, Sun & Mon 
you probably want to use the Gas Daily Midpoint Price published on Tuesday. 
Otherwise, the Tues price is published wednesday, etc  and the friday price 
is published on Monday.  Or do you want to use and average of the price 
applicable for Friday flow and the price applicable for Monday flow for the 
weekend period.  Just questions to consider.  Please call if you need to 
include any of the above concepts in the offer.

Attached is some language that we are considering for a deal.  Could you take 
a look at is and give me the "legal" ok on it?  Or add to or Change it so 
that we are legally comfortable with it?

CAYMAN ISLANDS COMPANIES

I'm attaching a memorandum from Hunter & Hunter, our Cayman Islands counsel, 
regarding recent changes in Cayman Islands laws and regulations.  Please 
forward it to other interested parties in your departments.

One immediate consequence of these changes is the request by counsel that we 
provide them with more detail on the intended business activities of our new 
subsidiaries in the A&J memos that are sent to them.  Without being 
impractical, something more than "Oil & Gas exploration in Mexico" (by way of 
example) is requested.  If it is impossible to provide more meaningful detail 
without going on extensively, then the current practice will have to continue 
to be acceptable.  However, a business purpose of "holding company" is 
probably not going to be acceptable.

If you have specific questions or concerns after reviewing the memorandum, I 
suggest that you contact Rory Todd or another representative of Hunter & 
Hunter (phone:  345-949-4900; fax:  345-949-5175; email rtodd@huntlaw.com.ky).

Mike,
 Jeff has forwarded your request to me.  A search of our data base has failed 
to identify the named wells or any contracts with the named individuals.  Can 
you provide any other information?

I understand you may be able to shed some light on this.  I have received a 
complaint naming ECT as a defendant, filed by Jeff Brown, dba M&J Energy.  
The allegation is that his partner, Mr Buckey is diverting payments for gas 
purchased from  wells owned by Brown, Buckey and others.  The wells are 
described in the complaint as Rea #1 and #2 and Cullen #1 and $2 in 
Washington County, OH (Marietta).  ECT is named b/c ECT is buying the gas 
from the well and allegedly paying the wrong person for the gas (I can't see 
how that gives rise to any claim, but that's beside the point).

I can't find where EES is buying gas from this well, so that leaves you.  Is 
this ECT's gas?  MDS

Dan--

Good job with Quantum / Enernet...we're finally close (i hope).

Attached is the Coleman Purchase Agreement  --   I have included their wiring 
instructions which I just received.  After Howard Hertzburg calls you, we can 
incorporate his comments, if any, and generate final drafts.

Thanks

What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as 
if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise?

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).

UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

ABSOLUTELY SWEET MARIE
submitted by Tim Breth 

Billy Bob and Lester were   talking one afternoon when Billy Bob tells 
Lester, "Ya know, I reckon I'm about ready for a vacation. Only this year I'm 
gonna do it a little different.  The last few years, I took your suggestions 
as to where to go.  Three years ago you said to go to Hawaii. I went to 
Hawaii and Marie got pregnant.  Then two years ago, you told me to go to the
Bahamas, and Marie got pregnant again.  Last year you suggested Tahiti and 
darned if Marie didn't get pregnant
again."

Lester asks Billy Bob, "So, what you gonna do this year that's
different?"

Billy Bob says, "This year I'm taking Marie with me."

Per the request of Alan Kilpatrick, I am forwarding to you Southern's
comments on your proposed confidentiality agreement.  As you can see,
they are almost entirely editorial and relate to the inclusion of
seemingly duplicative provisions.  The one substantive point is that we
do not agree to venue provisions, although we will agree in this case to
Texas choice of law.

Please let us know if these changes are acceptable in advance of the
Thursday meeting.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

Dan, 

El Paso Electric's lawyer is Will Garant and his number is 512-495-8832.  He 
is the one dealing with our LT contract and is familiar with the collateral 
issues.  Matt Henry is the lawyer that drafted their long term contract 
attached.  I can get his number if you need it but I think he works at the 
same firm as Will.

Let me know what I can do to help and if you have any questions.

Thanks again for your help.

Kim

As most of you have probably heard already, I am leaving Enron to pursue some 
new endeavors.  I will be moving back home to Toronto and I'm going to take 
some time off to do some travelling.  I plan to go back to school in January, 
and after that.... we'll see what life has in store!  

I wanted to thank all of you for the many wonderful experiences I have had 
here at Enron.  It has been a pleasure working with and getting to know you 
all.  I hope that if you're ever in Toronto you will drop me a line.

My last day of work will be June 30th, however, I will be staying in Houston 
until the end of July.  I hope to see or speak to all of you before I leave, 
but if I don't manage to, please keep in touch.  My e-mail address is 
jennifer_sabine@yahoo.com.

Take care and good luck!
Jennifer

Subject: New deals on HPL

On Friday, Nov 10, we had a new long term deal entered under HPL.  It was a 
wellhead deal with Conoco at four different meters.  It was priced at 94% of 
HSC index.  The value on the deal was $1,097,210.  Logically, this would 
increase our recoverable cost from $193 mil to $194 mil.  I will send you 
notes periodically on new long term deals that increase our unwind costs.

Dave

Carl - attached below is a red lined version of the Transaction Agreement. 

Please note our treatment of the increased DCQ.  Essentially, we simplified 
the language by placing it under DAILY CONTRACT QUANTITY.   Placing the 
language here makes the volume increase part of the defined term DCQ. 
Therefore any reference to DCQ, including pricing, will apply to the 
increased volumes.   

Let me know if this is acceptable.  I will thereafter forward originals for 
signature.

thanks

chris

Gentlemen:

Here are the revised documents in both clean and marked form.  I made the 
requested change in the Term section.  That section defines a Early 
Termination as any termination prior to the end of 3 contract years.  As such 
no change was needed to the Buyer's Contract section.  Please call if you 
need anything further.  

        Thanks, Dan

"Oil" means crude off, condensate and other liquid hydrocarbons meeting the 
quality standards and specifications set forth in Article VI hereof.  also, 
do we even need this definition?
*****************************************
"Payment Date" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR 
Business Day of the next following Month.  For example, February 28, 2001 is 
the Payment Date for the Month of January 2001.  i think this reads better if 
we say:
"Payment Date" means, for or with respect to any Month, the last LIBOR 
Business Day of the Month following the production Month.  For example, 
February 28, 2001 is the Payment Date for the production Month of January 
2001.  
*****************************************
Section 3.3. Enforcement of Production Payment Documents.  Seller shall take 
all actions as may be appropriate to abide by the provisions of the 
Production Payment Documents and enforce the provisions of the Production 
Payment Documents against the Producer.  Seller shall not amend any 
Production Payment Document in any material respect without the consent of 
Buyer.

once again, i think this should state, that consent is only needed when 
amending something that will change any of the items tied to the Confirm - 
term, price, volume...  we should be able to change capex, or even the oil 
vols... w/o consent.
*****************************************
Section 4.2. Scheduling.  Not less than fifteen (15) Days prior to the first 
Day of each Month during the Term of a Transaction, Seller will notify Buyer 
of the daily quantities of Gas that Seller expects to be available for 
delivery to Buyer hereunder at each Delivery Point during such Month. No 
later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to Buyer's Transporter's nomination 
deadline for such Month, Buyer agrees to schedule for delivery at each 
Delivery Point commencing on the first Day of such Month the quantities of 
Gas which Seller expects to deliver in kind to Buyer at each Delivery Point 
during such Month pursuant to this Agreement.  Although Buyer recognizes that 
the quantity at each Delivery Point may fluctuate in accordance with the 
provisions of the Production Payment Documents, Seller agrees to provide 
Buyer immediately upon receipt by Seller a copy of any notice or agreement to 
change any rate of production or Delivery Point under the terms of the 
applicable Production Payment Documents. make this 3 Business Days
*****************************************
Section 7.1. Price.  Buyer shall pay Seller for all Gas delivered hereunder 
each Month in compliance with Sections 4.1, 6.1 and 6.4 by making the 
calculations described below for each Transaction (after disregarding any 
Measurement and Allocation Inaccuracies), adding together for all 
Transactions all amounts deemed owed by Buyer to Seller and by Seller to 
Buyer during such Month, and paying to Seller the resulting net amount deemed 
owed by Buyer to Seller on the Payment Date for such Month as provided in 
Section 8.1 (provided that if such resulting net amount is owed by Seller to 
Buyer then Seller shall pay the same to Buyer):
i need to think about this, but i think in reality, ENA will pay to Brazos 
each confirm/deal separately.  but i think this is such a small, moot point 
that i won't pursue.
*****************************************
Section 7.1. Price.  under b: refers to Index Price - the confirm/transaction 
agrmt calls this the Spot Price.  this needs to jive.  
*****************************************

section 14.1, make me the Notices person.  fax #646.3640 & 
joan.quick@enron.com
i'm not sure who you want to put for ENA - bob bowen's group?  if so, fax # 
is 646.4816.
*****************************************
we need a transaction agreement for crescendo.

*****************************************
re the transaction agreement for st mary's [which is attached].  we need to 
specify somewhere in that agrmt that that is the st. mary's deal... per the 
confirm definition [see below].  so that one can figure out which confirm 
goes with which deal.

"Confirmation" means, with respect to a Transaction, a confirmation letter or 
statement between Buyer and Seller, setting forth for such Transaction the 
applicable Effective Date, Contract Price, Index Price, Delivery Points, and 
Scheduled Amounts and a reference to the related Conveyance

*****************************************
also re the transaction agreement for st mary's, do we want the MaxDQ to 
state that?  what happens if 100% of the gas is down on day 5, and they want 
to make it all up on day 6.  i don't think we s/b limited to 25%.  ALSO, the 
agrmt refers to the enfolio agmt, which needs to be changed.

Please review the Collateral Threshold amount language added as item 12 to 
the Firm GTC.  The 3rd party debt default language was added as a triggering

Debbie,

Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.  
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed 
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to 
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which 
we have received.

Thanks

Russell

Dan,
 I have attached the first draft of the Petrogulf Corporation purchase 
agreement and gathering agreement.  As we discussed this morning, I have made 
no mention to the Bear Paw issue.  Additionally, your proposal is to purchase 
up to 10,000/d at NGPL (OK) Index.  Is the next item in error, it reads 
"above 5,000 up to 80%".  I changed it to "above 10,000 up to 80%".  Please 
review, I believe I incorporated all of your items in the form, if not, 
please call and I will modify.

When the existing VPP's get syndicated into Brazos later this week, then they 
will be between Brazos [not Entrada] and Crescendo, and Brazos [not ECT 
Merchant...] and St. Mary's, who is the person responsible for making sure 
that the ENA contracts group makes the name change [assignment], and that 
everything in ENA's internal system - Sitara gets changed accordingly?  And 
also to make sure that these deals do not get duplicated?

thanks

In furtherance of the message which I left for you, please find attached a 
copy of a replacement guarantee for your review.

As you are aware, Enron is currently in the process of amending a number of 
guarantees with respect to various Engage Energy entities.  Under the 
project, the 
 US$25 million guarantee provided to Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries to 
guarantee the obligations of Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage Energy  US 
L.P. ,as provided by The Coastal Corp. (the "Existing Guarantee"), is to be 
replaced with a number of guarantees which are segmented by the Engage Energy 
entities and the type of contract (i.e. physical v. financial).  

As part of this project, Russell Diamond has provided Enron Canada Corp. with 
revised credit terms for dealing with Engage Energy Canada, L.P. under which 
Westcoast Gas Inc. is to provide a US$20million guarantee of the obligations 
of Engage Energy Canada L.P. under the existing master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between the Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron 
Canada Corp. (the "ECC Physical Master") as well as the master physical gas 
purchase/sale agreement between Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Enron North 
America Corp. (the "ENA Physical Master").   Russell had allocated US$15 
million of the replacement guarantee to the ECC Physical Master and 
US$5million to the ENA Physical Master.

Due to other inadequacies in the ECC Physical Master, we have prepared an 
"Amended and Restated" ECC Physical Master which includes a number of 
significant terms in addition to referring to the replacement guarantee 
(which we are quite eager to have Engage execute).  As a result, I have 
prepared a draft of  replacement guarantee (to be received from Westcoast Gas 
Inc.) to accompany the Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.  However, to 
ensure that the replacement guarantee meets your requirements, I am looking 
for your input.  Please find attached a copy of the draft replacement 
guarantee as blacklined to indicate the changes which have been made to the 
Enron Canada Corp. standard guarantee to incorporate the obligations owing to 
Enron North America Corp.  As you will see, there are a few bullets for which 
I require your assistance in completing (i.e. date the of ENA Physical Master 
and the appropriate contact information for notices).

When you get the opportunity, could you please review the blacklined 
replacement guarantee?  Once again, we are quite eager to send out the 
Amended and Restated ECC Physical Master.

Thanks for your help.

Mark Powell ((403) 974-6708)



Note to Russell:  Russell, you were going to confirm for me that the existing 
Enron Corp. guarantee delivered to Engage Energy Canada L.P. and Engage 
Energy US L.P. to secure the obligations of Enron Canada Corp., Enron North 
America Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (in the amount of $35 million) 
dated June 1, 1998 is NOT to be replaced.  Has there been any progress on 
this front?

for signature.  In case I forget, please remind me to send you a certified
copy of the resolution.  I know it's been signed by all, including the
mayor.  The PG&E bankruptcy has taken up a lot of my attention, and I may

Dan,

Ann Elizabeth prepared an agreement last week whereby
Harris County MUD No. 23 would be allowed certain
access across HPL Bammel property to do work on
their drainage ditches.  After a review of the agreement
by Steve Schneider, he suggested that language be
added concerning a matting of the property over
the pipelines when "heavy machinery" is used.  Also,
he suggested that language as to property/road
restoration be added.

Taffy, can you email a copy of the agreement to Dan
so he can make these changes (I was only provided
hard copies)?

Please let me know if you have any questions!

Thank you very much,

Doug,
 As we discussed, Larry Pardue has requested that I get you to sign an 
officer's certificate regarding the execution and delivery of the Fuel Supply 
Agreements.  The document that he forwarded to me does not define the 
agreements that he wants you to certify as to.  They are vaguely referred to 
as Transaction Agreements which have been delivered.  As far as I know, he 
may be wanting a certification as to the Consent documents.  If they get back 
to me, I will request that they modify the document to reflect the Fuel 
Supply Agreements only and that you are not aware of any reason why they 
would not be valid under New York law, that you are not aware of any lawsuit 
threatened against EPOS as a result of it entering into these Fuel Supply 
Agreements and that so far as you know, EPOS is not an investment company as 
such term is defined.  I will let you know what Larry is able to modify.

Mike,
 I have checked with the credit group and the suggested changes to the 
confidentiality agreement and to Exhibit "C" and "D" are acceptable.  They 
did point out a typo in the collateral threshold provision.  It should read 
$1,500,000 instead of $1,5000,000.  Please accept the redlined changes to the 
documents and make the above correction and the documents should be ready for 
you to start the execution process.  I am informed that credit will not make 
any changes of the $1,500,000 collateral threshold amount until they have had 
an opportunity to review the Ormet financial information.  Thereafter we can 
work on an amendment if they feel that the financial information warrants 
making a change.

Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that

I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.

Attacked are comments received this morning from Reynolds Metals on a 
combined transportation/sale transaction that they have been working relative 
to Reynolds Gregory plant.   Reynold's comments to the Form of Enfolio Master 
that we sent them in early October, 1999 (see hpl.doc file below) are 
extensive and I'm going to need your help sorting out which ones we can work 
with and which ones are non-negotiable.  I'll be able to take care of the 
Transportation comments.  I'll let you know when Greg and Lee are ready to 
meet on this matter.

After you have had time to review thgese, lets setup a time to discuss.
Ihave attached our gas specs that HPL needs to meet.
Comments on Enfolio are in hpl.doc and comments of hpl.doc is the comments
on transportation agreement.  Not these are comments, many legal questions
asked, but need to discuss the "business deal more"!

This is another contract that I have been requested to extend past the 
original term of  deal #222899 entered into Sitara.  Again this Counterparty

Under FINANCIAL MATTERS: BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT in
Appendix 1, I propose the following revised wording since we are not able to
provide a purchase order number at this time:

"Invoices for payments and correspondence for this Agreement must reference
Buyer's Purchase Order Number if such has been provided to Seller prior to
the first (1st) Business Day following the month of Gas deliveries.  If the
Purchase Order Number has been timely provided to Seller, invoices which do
not reference Buyer's Purchase Order Number will be returned unpaid.  All
invoices shall include any supporting documentation necessary to verify the
charges billed."

Mr. Hyvl,

There was one change that you did not make that I requested.  It was
difficult to tell since only a single word was bolded.

APPENDIX "1"  FINANCIAL MATTERS  BILLING, INVOICE DATE, CHARGES AND PAYMENT

"Buyer shall remit any amounts due on the 25th day of the Month in which
Seller's statement was received.  If the due date for any payment to be made
under this Agreement is not a Customer's Business Day, the due date for such
payment shall be the following Customer's Business Day."

There are very few instances where our Business Day would be different from
your business day.  However, as an example, the day after Thanksgiving is a
CPS holiday.  This year, we had a gas payment due on that date which we sent
on the following Monday.  This is probably the only holiday CPS has that
your company may not have.

Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
you
a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
off on them.

 We currently have a Master with Eastern New Mexico Natural Gas Association,

Dan, 

Thanks for looking at this for me.  I did remove the phrase you mention in 
number 1 below.  As for a volume cap, I don't think that one is necessary in 
this case.  Their TW contract limits them to 1000 MMBtu/day.  Any prices that 
are fixed will not include TW transport charges.

Thanks again,

Kim

ps, once their board approves this term sheet, we will need to do a 
confirmation.  Will this be generated by you or when the deal is entered into 
the system?

Kim,
 I have reviewed your term sheet and have the following questions.  
1.  Under Term, you have included the phrase "with annual redetermination" 
however I find no redetermination language in the Price  section.  I would 
suggest that the phrase be deleted.
2.  Under Quantity, you indicate there expected volumes, however, we need to 
put some cap on the maximum, With a 5 year term, we should offer some maximum 
such as 200% of the expected volumes.  Any thoughts relating to a cap?
3.  Under Price you indicate that the price could be changed to a Fixed 
Price, I assume that you do not intend to include the Transwestern 
transportation charges as a part of the Fixed Price.  Is this correct?  and 
if so, does the Fixed Price language need to be qualified?  
 Otherwise, the term sheet appears okay.  
      Dan

 I have compared the attached revision to the language which we discussed

acceptable.   If you desire, I will have someone remark the consent to make

Doug,
 We need to discuss how to proceed if they refuse to make the changes we 
need.  We have not previously commented on the attached version because we 
were working from the V & E markup.  That should be our starting point.

Barbara,
I spoke, through a few voicemail messages, with Robert Rose earlier today
regarding the status of the easement we discussed a few weeks ago.  He
informed me that he turned in a draft to you and Ann Elizabeth a week or so
ago and had yet to hear back from either of you.  I was hoping to be able to
give a progress report to the engineer and developer working on the project
by Wednesday of next week (ideally with some progress to actually report),
so if it is at all possible to let me know, or have Robert let me know,
where everything stands, I would appreciate hearing from you.
Thanks,
Erin

Barbara,
I am following up on our conversation last week in which you asked me to
contact you if I hadn't heard back from you by today.  Please let me know
if
you are having any success in finding the right person to talk to regarding
the easement we previously discussed.  Thanks again for your time and
effort.
Best Regards,
Erin

A single man wanted someone to help him with the household
chores, so he decided to get a pet to help out. He went to
the local pet shop and asked the owner for advice on a
suitable animal. The owner suggested a dog, but the man said,
"Nah, dogs can't do dishes." The owner then suggested a cat,
but the man said, "Nah, cats can't do the ironing."

Finally the owner suggests a centipede, "This is the perfect
pet for you. It can do anything!" "OK," the man thought,
"I'll give it a try," so he bought it and took it home. Once
home he told the centipede to wash the dishes. The centipede
looks over and there are piles and piles of dirty dishes that
look to be a month old. Five minutes later, all the pots are
washed, dried, and put away. "Great," thought the man.

Now he told the centipede to do the dusting and vacuuming.
Fifteen minutes later the house is spotless. Wow, thought the
man, so he decided to try another idea. "Go down to the
corner and get me the evening paper," he told the centipede,
and off it went.

Fifteen minutes later, the centipede hadn't returned. 30
minutes later and still no centipede. Forty-five minutes and
the man was sick of waiting, so he got up and went out to
look for the centipede.

As he opened the front door, there on the step was the
centipede. "Hey, whatcha' doing there? I sent you out for the
paper 45 minutes ago and now I find you out here without the
paper! What gives?"

"Hold on a minute!" said the centipede, "I'm still putting on
my boots!"

Dan:

I have a dilemma and I'm almost too embarrassed to ask you to help me
resolve it.  As a matter of policy in this department, we are to stress the
fact that we "need" "financially firm" language in all contracts.  When the
Trader requested a contract with Enovate, he was not clear about his
trading intentions and it was assumed that "financially firm" "needed" to
be in the contract.  It seems that this language is now holding up the
execution process of the Enovate LLC contract.  The Business Unit wants
"financially firm" out and "firm" substituted.

The definition for "firm" that they want in the contract is the standard
definition for "firm" that is in the GISB as follows:

"Firm" shall mean that either party may interrupt its performance without
liability only to the extent that such performance is prevented for reasons
of Force Majeure; provided, however, that during Force Majeure
interruptions, the party invoking Force Majeure may be responsible for any
imbalance charges as set forth in Section 7.2 related to its interruption
after the nomination is made to the Transporter and until the change in
deliveries and/or receipts is confirmed by the Transporter.

I believe the only other place in the contract that "Financially Firm"
appears is on the first page, Article 2. SCOPE OF AGREEMENT:, second line,
would you please change that occurrence of "Financially Firm" to just
"firm"?

Dan, can you help me with this without trashing the whole contract?  On the
first page, we can line through "Financially" and initial, and then just
the definition page on the first page of APPENDIX "1" would have to be
redone to replace "Financially Firm" with just "Firm".

Please let me know if this is able to be done.

Thanks and I'm so sorry,

Ellen Dailey

If you could redraft the "representations and warranties" provision to be
simpler and clearer, I think that we could agree to it.  The other items
look fine.

My reading is that Enron seeks a continuing representation that (i) all
transactions have the appropriate approval, waiving any defense of lack of
authority, (ii) there is no sovereign immunity (something is left out of
thelanguage) defense to any transaction, (iii) payment for the gas will be
first in the flow of funds, and (iv) the obligations are not subject to debt
restrictions or other public funds restrictions of the Texas Constitution,
statutes or CPS constituency documents.  I think we can legally make these
representations and warranties, but the language needs some work.  You
should ask them to redraft this provision so it is simpler and clearer.  Jon

Mr. Wood,

This is a spot gas contract with Enron that you reviewed on August 8th for
Mary Pelayo and Danny McWhirter.  Enron has added a paragraph under
"Representations and Warranties" that I would like you to review.  I am not
sure exactly what it means.  Thank you.

Kathy,

This spot gas contract was reviewed by Jon Wood a few months ago.  The
following was added under "Representations and Warranties" by Enron.  I have
highlighted the text in the attachment so you can see where it was
incorporated (page 2 of Appendix 1).

"Further and with respect to Customer only, Customer represents and warrants
to Company continuing throughout the term of this Agreement as follows:  (i)
all acts necessary to the valid execution and performance of this Agreement
have been duly adopted, (ii) with respect to the contractual obligations
hereunder and performance thereof, it is not entitled to itself or its
revenues or assets from (a) suit, (b) jurisdiction of court, (c) relief by
way of injunction, order for specific performance or recovery of property,
(d) attachment of assets or (e) execution or enforcement of any judgment,
(iii) its obligations to make payments hereunder are unsubordinated
obligations and such payments are operating and maintenance costs which
enjoy first priority of payment at all times under any and all indentures to
which it is a party, its constitutional and governing documents and
applicable law, and (iv) its obligations to make payments hereunder do not
constitute any kind of indebtedness of Customer or create any kind of lien
on, or security interest in, any property or revenues of Customer which, in
either case , is proscribed by any provision of its constitutional and
governing documents, any order to judgment of any court or other agency of
government applicable to it or its assets, or any contractual restriction
binding on or affecting it or any of its assets."

Do you think this is acceptable, or do you think I should show this added
paragraph to Jon Wood?

regassified LNG to SCS for use  in a potential new plant to be built in
McIntosh, Georgia, together with the confirmation letter containing the

Stacy,
 The Reliant Energy changes which Ellen Dailey sent to you in August appeared 
in my chair this morning.  I had discussed the Enovate/Reliant changes with 
Ellen yesterday and we resolved most of the language except for the items I 
noted as being Credit Dept calls, which Russell has yet to respond to.  I 
agreed to make similar changes to the ENA/Reliant contract to that agreed 
upon in the Enovate/Reliant contract.  In reviewing the materials that Ellen 
sent you as marked, it appears that we had resolved all of the items in the 
ENA/Reliant markup except for the credit driven items.  Therefore, I will 
create a red-line and send back to Ellen next week, if Russell responds to my 
earlier emails and to this email.  Call if this is not what you desire.

I agree, Sunday was really enjoyable. It was so nice to have all the moms
that are still with us around and to be able to serve them for once.
Celebrating Mom's birthday on Saturday should be great. Just let me know
what to bring and I'll be there.
In regards to Mom...yes, she seems quite concerned about us putting her into
a nursing home if she lets on that she forgets things; she was almost in
tears when she talked about it, remember Doris? Anyway, we need to attempt
to assure her that won't happen as long as she continues to take her tests
and medicines as she needs to.
I agree with Bill that we might want to consider a checking account which
requires 2 signatures over a certain amount (say $500 or $1000..whatever we
agree is a "safe" amount)...Doris would be the most likely candidate, I
feel, since she is there and much more aware of Mom's daily needs or
desires. She must understand that by doing this, we would not "take control"
of her money...just help her "remember" payment of large purchases. She
still needs to be able to buy what she wants or needs...Our concern is
someone "conning" her out of money without her realization of it.Requiring 2
signatures on checks over a certain dollar amount would help, I feel.
Anyway, you'all think about it. Other suggestions? Doris, you see the
day-to-day activities, so you are probably best to bring to Dan and my
attention matters that appear to be a problem for Mom....and between the 3
of us, surely we can work out a solution that helps Mom and still lets her
maintain her dignity and respect.
OK>>>>see you'all on the 3rd...let me know what things I need to
bring..Wanna get a gift? I was thinking that a Bunn coffee maker would be so
nice for her...quick coffee, and ready whenever she wants it...plus maybe it
won't spill all over the counter, etc. when poured..Think about it, if
you'all want to go in on it together...If not for her birthday..maybe
Christmas? ..Just a thought.

In BP Amoco's response, they obviously do not understand the relationships 
between the parties.  

(1)  There is no reason to amend the Seacrest easement with BP Amoco, as the 
224' of 12" pipeline installed by HPL has nothing to do with that easement or 
Seacrest, except that it is connected to HPL where the Seacrest easement 
stops.
(2)  HPL is not seeking an assignment of the Seacrest easement with BP Amoco, 
as HPL is not acquiring the Seacrest pipeline and has no interest in doing 
such at this point in time.
(3)  Because of our position on #1 and #2 above, we have no need to address 
their language.
(4)  HPL is not paying BP Amoco $50K, especially in light of their request 
under #5.
(5)  HPL is not altering it 1942 easement without some means of compensation 
(other easement right)  as was discussed in the last meeting.  I do not see 
anything in their response that addresses this issue.
(6)  HPL has nothing to do with the abandoned and unused portions of the 
Seacrest pipeline to Dow or Tejas, and certainly would not be in a legal 
position to represent such abandonment for something it does not own.
(7)  This is fine if we can reach settlement.
(8)  This is fine if we can reach settlement.

In light of the AEP transaction closing Friday, should Dan now become our 
point person on this and respond?

Carlos,

I have discussed these points with Doug Leach and with Ermes Melinchon, and I 
left you a message today to talk with you about them.  I think we can resolve 
all issues as set forth below and in the attached revised agreement. Please 
call me right away if you disagree, as I am posting this to the OPIC website 
and the circulating the agreement for execution.   I will send a revised 
agreement to Glencore in order to correct Section 5.3.

Doug--to the extent the side letter you referred to for Section 13.1 will 
amend the Fuel Supply Agreements (which I assume it will), we will need to 
show it to our lenders--please send the side letter to me ASAP.  

Thanks,
Diana

Subject: Re: PQPC-EPOS Fuel Supply Agreement  

Diana,

Sorry for the delay but last week we had two Board Meetings on Thursday and 
Friday.

Following you will find our comments:

1.- Section 5.3, in the note after the formula instead of " values used in 
calculating the above formula shall be set at "0" ", I suggest to write " 
Shall be taken out of the formula". This is because if you set those value at 
"0" you will have a wrong result in the formula. The issue is take out the 
correspondent factor.  Agreed.  I will change this.  

2.- Section 7.2 letter (a), first line: it refers that PQPC may cancel or 
reduce any PQPC's order prior to the Cancellation Date. The Cancellation Date 
is not less than 21 days prior to the fist day of the scheduled delivery 
period (1.3). But in section 7.1 letter (b)  reads that PQPC's order should 
be issued no later than 21 days prior of the fist day of the scheduled 
delivery period. Does it make sense?, I mean, the cancellation date could 
coincide with the PQPC's order day. Is it possible to have a Cancellation 
Date not less than 15 days?  This is okay as written.  

3.- Section 9.3. in the fourth line starting in "the sixth (6th.) day after 
...."  Why it is different of the latest version of FSA between EPOS and 
Glencore. In the FSA EPOS-GLENCORE is clear that " the sixth (6th) day of the 
calendar month following the calendar month in which the NOR date falls". 
This make sense since the invoice price will be the monthly average of the 
prices of the calendar month in which the NOR date falls.  Corrected.

4.- Section 9.3 in line 18, why it is deleted "average of the"  and in the 
FSA EPOS_Glencore it is active.  This was also deleted in the Glencore-EPOS 
FSA (at Glencore's request)

5.- Section 10.3 is missing the latest modification that was done in the FSA 
EPOS-Glencore. Also that correction needs to be rewrite: "EPOS shall be 
responsible for additional demurrage charges caused by EPOS failing to arrive 
at the unloading point during the scheduled delivery period to the extend 
such demurrage cost are a direct result of such failure".  Corrected.

6.- In the middle of Section 12.1, after " which meets the specifications set 
forth herein"  is missing "said quantity to be officially measured at the 
shore tank's up-gauge" like was included in the FSA EPOS-Glencore.  
Corrected.  

7.- In Section 13.1. As we discussed some weeks ago, it is necessarily to 
include that in no event the laytime should be less than 24 hours. I remember 
that Doug Leach already talked about it with Glencore and every body agreed.  
Doug Leach advised me that this would be handled in a side letter that will 
also apply to Corinto. 

8.- In section 13.2, after "Section 10.2" should be included "and 10.3" like 
it is in the FSA EPOS-Glencore.  Corrected

9.- In Clause XVIII, the telephone of PQPC is (502) 368-1793 and the 
facsimile (502) 368-2555. These numbers should be included.  Corrected

10.- Section 21.7, instead of "Glencore and EPOS" should be "EPOS and PQPC".  
Corrected

Regards, Carlos

Dan, Bruce Kohrs of Keyspan left me a message this weekend with respect to 
the schedule 'A' that they would like attached.  Assuming that the central 
desk has agreed to the contents of schedule 'A' - and they have been involved 
in drafting this document - I don't see a lot of commercial risk, especially 
given the lack of 'damages' in the event of any defaults to schedule 'A'.  My 
understanding was that we would all work together on a reasonable efforts 
basis to allow gas to flow daily.  They contents of schedule 'A' and its true 
enforceability does not seem to really change the spirit of the agreement.
If they are really adamant about including the schedule 'A', and the central 
desk has reviewed and expressly agreed to its contents, then I would not 
object to including the schedule 'A' as part of the contract.

If in fact the plant has been sold it is even more important that we receive 
formal notice from HMPC regarding the cancellation of the fuel supply 
agreement. Who handled the sale of HMPC's assets?

I feel we should arrange to cancel the contract formally for good records.  

All the people I knew in HMPC have already left the company.  Understand the 
plant been sold!!

Nicor Petroleum - been re-organized, all the personnel who was involved in 
the fuel contract have also left the company.  

I will also be leaving Enron at the end of the year for retirement.

Enron Fuels International (EFI) has a long term gasoil supply agreement with 
HMPC which has not been used for several years. What is the current and 
future status of the plant? If the plant is not going to operate and not need 
liquid fuel deliveries, then I need someone within HMPC to send a formal 
notice to EFI cancelling the fuel supply contract. We have requested this 
several times over the past few years to no avail.

Just wanted to thank everybody who works with Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Our former three year deal with them expired September 30.  Last week, we 
(finally) executed a new contract that keeps HPL as their largest natural gas 
supplier through September 30, 2002.  Also, when their volumes go up in early 
2001, they will once again be HPL's single largest industrial customer.

Everybody's hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off.  Although 
they can be very demanding to work with (particularly now that they are part 
of Exxon), they know that HPL provides them the best overall service.

Please pass on thanks to anyone I've left off the list who has worked with 
Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Dan:

With some revision I think this would work for gas.  What do you think?

		 Subject: Master Oil Contract for Brazos VPP Limited Partnership



Here is my attempt to blend together the requirements of our new deal, as
expressed in the term sheet, with the old Cactus oil sales agreement, the
inserts Alan has sent me, and the sections of the Enfolio contract that
seemed to me to be applicable to this kind of financial deal.  This draft
agreement:

1.   has a term that lasts as long as the VPPs.

2.   contemplates written Confirmations only.

3.   provides a price adjustment mechanism for under-deliveries, but does
not characterize under or over-deliveries as breaches that justify damages.

4.   does not give Brazos, as Seller, any special remedies if ERAC fails to
take.

5.   provides for netting across all transactions on a single monthly
payment date that matches the settlement date under the interest rate
swaps.

6.   has a very limited ability for the Buyer to terminate upon default
(and even this may be too much for the Banks).

7.   includes the limitation of damages provisions and arbitration
provisions from the Enfolio Gas Contract.

8.   references the Conoco General Provisions.

9.   in general, recognizes that the party on the other side from ERAC is a
partnership controlled by an Enron general partner.

If this draft agreement represents a good compromise, I suspose no one will
be really happy with it.  In any event, this is my attempt to give the
Banks what we said in the term sheet that we would provide and also give as
much protection as possible to ERAC.

One issue is not covered in the attached draft, and that is what the
Contract Price and the Index Price will be.  In order to fit well with the
other components of the deal, the Contract Price needs to be the floating
price that is swapped with ENA and the Index Price needs to be the spot
market price that is named as the "Index Price" in each Production Payment
Conveyance.  If the Index Price named in the two existing Conveyances is
not satisfactory to ERAC, I suppose that the oil desk and the VPP
origination group will need to settle up outside the boundaries of the deal
documents to which the Banks are parties, because I believe the Banks will
consider it a fatal flaw in the deal if the Adjustment Quantities of Oil
provided under the Conveyances cannot be converted into the necessary
amounts of sales proceeds under this Master Oil Sales Agreement.

Please let me know how you want to proceed from here with this document.
We need to get it to the Banks as soon as possible, but we need to know
first whether it is correct.  Here it is:

Lee,
 Please have these printed on the new HPL letterhead.  Please correct the 
addresses and phone numbers.  Ask Janie to attach the current GTC to the 
letters.  Call if you have any questions.

Dan

I did two gas deals with Oxy Vinyls LP, and repeated a Keep Ready Agreement
with Occidental Chemical.


For the gas deals, we can use the same special purpose GTC that we used
last year (it is unique to Oxy).  Here are the deals:

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39crfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
Battleground Road plant HPL meter # 1485
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-39acrfm.doc
5,000 MMBtu per day
La Porte plant HPL meter # 1444
Inside FERC Houston Ship Channel index minus $0.0075
July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002


For the Keep Ready Agreement, everything is the same as last year .....

Document used last year: o:\Legal\DHYVL\DJH\2000\Ltr\2000-47ltr.doc
Term June 1, 2001 to May 31, 2002
One change ... at the end of Section 4, need to delete the last 5 words "OR
THE BILL OF SALE" .... we had come up with this agreement by adapting
another one, and had to manually strike these words because they are not
relevant.


Thanks

Lee

Master for the 30,000/ day parcel.  Could you draft a form for the 5,000/day 
parcel winter only.  I need this turned around so I can forward to the 
Reliant people ASAP.  I also need to forward any changes to the agreement 
past our partners PEC legals folks.

Thanks,

Dan,

Instead of saying that the customer has just 10 days written notice to get 
out of the deal, we should add something to this effect - "subject to the 
monthly deadline established by Southern California Gas Company for 
terminating authorized marketer arrangements."

Let me know if you have any quesitons - 503-464-3826 or cell 503-805-2117.

Dan,

We may change the wire transfer to a check.......I am trying to find out why 
they don't want to use the wire transfer option.
On section 5, I do not want to add the proposed sentences.
Section 8, I am explaining to WestPort that this would only be done fo good 
and reasonable cause.
Section 9, Do we have a problem making the assignment language bi lateral??
Section 11, I am trying to find out why they want to add the sentence.

Mike,
 Are we sticking with wire transfer as the method for payment?  I assume that 
we are.
 Section 5 Pressures -  Is there any need to include the two sentences they 
proposed at the end of that section?  I assume there is not.
 I see no need to make any of the changes proposed in Sections 8,  9 & 11.  
Do you agree?
 Assuming you are okay with the above I have attached a revised contract both 
red-line and clean for your review.

Dan,

The breakout of $0.20 for field gathering, $0.15 for compression plus actual 
fuel and shrink, and $0.15 for Ft. Union gathering works for me.

The last line of Section 2.1 is a problem. We cannnot guarantee a Feb 15. 
date. I would like to put that we will endeavor to install the facilities as 
quickly as conditions allow after the required permits are received by Enron
. 
Section 4.2 - I don't agree with 90 days......I would settle on 45 days.

In the General Terms and Conditions definitions we need to leave dehydrator 
fuel and dehydrating terms in under Equivalent Quantities and Gathering.
Under Quality the 6% by volume of total inerts must stay.

Let me know what you have a problem with.

Thanks,
Mike

Westport will go along with breaking up the service into field gathering, 
gathering and compression.
Let me know where to go from here.
Is this just a matter of changing everything back the way it was with the 
exception of the Gathering Fee section and responding to their other changes?

Darren,
I am going to send three options to Haldor Topsoe to choose from; all three 
will require a master physical:
 1) Leave current deal at 125% Index and add 1200 mmbtu/d new volumes through 
8/31/2002 @ 115% Index
 2) Price existing deal and new volumes through 8/31/2002 @ 120% Index
 3)  Show a variety of floors and collars to reduce the index percentage 
through 8/31/2002 for all volumes.
I believe I have approval for these three options.  MTM value for all options 
should calculate to be around $230,000.

However, now is an outstanding time to increase the value to Enron by 
extending this deal another two years and hence doubling the MTM value.  They 
will not transact at  these levels two years from now without us having to 
put facilities in the ground.  Please consider a two year extension or tell 
me what requirements would have to be met to do this.

Thanks,

Gary

Gary,
 As I stated before, I will forward a new worksheet to Dan Hyvl for JER/BRE, 
but we are NOT to enter into another transaction until the document is 
executed. Seeing as JER wanted to fix a price this week, I think that it will 
be difficult to get this deal completed. Please follow up with Wayne at JER.
 In addition, I am forwading a worksheet for Haldor Topsoe as well. We can 
NOT enter into the new transaction with additional volumes with them until 
their master is signed as well. 

If you have any questions please call.

Hey Dan, Gary,

Gary entered into this transation to sell this counterparty 1,000 mmbtu/d at 
an Index related price with a Put option of $3.50 and a premium of 0.095.  As 
I understand it, Gary will never be buying gas from his counterparty and this 
is the only transaction he plans on doing with the counterparty.  If this is 
the case, I would think only a Master Sales agreement would be needed instead 
of a Master Purchase Sale Agreement and thus a Credit Worksheet is not 
needed. Please let me know if this is not the case.

Thanks
Russell

majeure.

2.  in 1 say that demand charges shall not exceed .055.   Also put in there

verify what we are charged for deficient volumes.


3.  Add a sentence at the end of no.1 that says that "Provided that prioir to 
Company's incurring those incremental gas transportation and/or gas supply 
costs, customer agrees to pay the incremental amount. "   (they want us to 
notify them first and have them agree before we schedule the gas to them)

4.   On the contract, in the definition of Force Majeure they want to add 
"for any reason including but not limited to operational or economic reasons"

Dan,
Could you email your fax number.  I will then send a copy of the BancFirst

The JOA Recording Supplement is apparently in route from the Campbell County

I will forward a copy to you upon receipt.

David and Janet, I am re-sending this e-mail that outlines RAC's view of the 
transaction, follow-up needed through the drafting of the documentation and 
RAC's required involvement, and the credit reserve tied to the value based on 
the latest transaction value and structure RAC has seen.  The 
"Comments/Questions" section of the attached e-mail outlines RAC's open 
issues, however, we have provided the appropriate credit reserve based on the 
value that we understand will be marked-to-market.  As the deal evolves and 
the value tied to the transaction changes so will RAC's valuation and credit 
reserve.  It is very important that we are copied on the documentation 
supporting the transaction so that we can understand the intricacies of the 
deal as well as Enron's obligations and remedies.  I have advised Dan Hyvle 
of RAC's need to be copied on the documentation.  If someone else in legal is 
running with this transaction during Dan's absence please let me know.  

I have scheduled a meeting at 5:00 PM, in Bill Bradford's office to discuss 
the content of the attached e-mail and any changes in the valuation of the 
transaction.

Subject: City of Lakeland ("Lakeland") Credit Reserve

Dave and Bill, I wanted to touch base with both of you on the status of my 
analysis for the Lakeland transaction.  I have been working very closely with 
Evan Betzer (ext. 34399) of the Structuring group as it relates to: (i) the 
value of the transaction and the key assumptions thereof: (ii) valuing the 
transaction in accordance with ECT's proposal to Lakeland versus valuing the 
transaction as though ECT only holds 50% of the position with the other 50% 
held by Sonat; and (iii) pondering determining if the transportation "Max 
Rate" used to value a portion of ECT's transportation obligation to Lakeland 
is a fixed rate or a variable rate - the Structuring Group's model assumes 
that the Max Rate is fixed for the 15 year term, and the delta between the 
transport curve and the Max Rate multiplied by the associated transportation 
volumes is the primary source of value of the Lakeland transaction; and (iv) 
determining why we would not value all transport volumes in a like manner as 
(iii) above.  

Separately, a considerable portion of the value tied to this transaction is 
tied to an "Accelerated Payment" feature, i.e.: gas payments are made on the 
20th of the delivery month versus the standard payment date of 25th of the 
following month whereas transport payments are made on the 10th of the 
delivery month versus the standard payment date of the 25th of the following 
month.  I have not placed any value on this portion of the deal and thus no 
credit reserve has been assigned to this portion of the deal.

Valuation: I have valued the Lakeland transaction at approximately $3.4MM 
(in-line with the Structuring group's valuation for the like scenario) with 
an associated credit reserve of $237M.  This valuation is based on the 
following key assumptions.

ECT is the Seller and no obligations are assumed by Sonat - the purpose of 
this approach is to value the transaction in accordance with the term sheet 
in front of Lakeland.
Lakeland will pay ECT Index minus $0.06/MMBtu on approximately 157,232,934 
MMBtu (45%) of the Firm MaxDQ - plus $0.0168/MMBtu paid to the desk, and 
Index minus $0.09/MMBtu on 192,971,190 MMBtu (55%) of the Firm MaxDQ - plus 
$0.0142/MMBtu paid to the desk.  The total PV loss tied to this index minus 
sale, on the Firm MaxDQ, is approximately $17.4MM.  FYI, I have included this 
associated monthly loss to ECT as an annuity in the credit reserve valuation 
process.
Transport is valued using the "Transport" curve (mid-market price of 
$0.2177), provided in the Structuring group's model against an assumed Max 
Rate of $0.75/MMBtu on real volumes of 68,908,381 MMBtu.  Based on the 
aforementioned, the AA value of transport is approximately $20.8MM.

Comments/Questions:  
I need to obtain the appropriate forward volatilities for the transport 
curve.  I am temporarily using NYMEX vols.  
I need to better understand why we are assigning value to some of the 
transport and not all of ECT's transport obligation.  In that light, I need 
to clarify what ECT's remedies and obligations are, as it relates to the 
transport that is being assigned to ECT from Lakeland, in a Lakeland default 
scenario.  The same questions surround the additional firm transport that is 
being purchased by ECT to support Lakeland's remaining Firm MaxDQ gas volumes 
(approximately 124 Bcf).
Has an agreement with Sonat been drafted that affords them the opportunity to 
fulfil a portion of ECT's obligations under its proposal to Lakeland?  If so, 
this transaction may need to be valued separately and based on such 
agreement's respective terms.  
Lastly, based on both the Structuring group's model and my analysis it would 
appear that the value of the Lakeland transaction resides with the desk.  The 
Origination group's value is tied to the value associated with its share of 
the Accelerated Payment feature of the transaction which RAC has not included 
in its valuation.

Hey Russell,

We talked about this point earlier (see an e-mail to you dated September 22, 
2000) and we agreed that the guarantees would not reference both Enron North 
America and Enron Canada Corp.  There were a number of reasons for this (ie. 
complexity regarding future amendments, the differences/peculiarities between 
Canadian and American law, possible "permanent establishment" issues we had 
discussed, etc.).  You may also want to look at the e-mail I sent to you on 
September 26, 2000 (re: the East desk deals with ENA).

Is this not the case anymore?  I think it is better to have separate 
guarantees for all of the reasons mentioned in the September 22, 2000 e-mail, 
the September 26, 2000 e-mail and this e-mail.

Please let me know.

Mark Powell

I know you are going to communicate with Coleman's attorney to answer his 
(hopefully) final concerns.  I have attached the gathering services primarily 
to remind you of the remaining change requested by Jim Anderson, my 
counterpart at Coleman.

However, I do have one last item to discuss with you that I hope we can 
handle just in the definitions section, so after your contact with Coleman's 
attorney, give me a ring.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.

Dan,

Would you please review a draft side letter that would cover the end of 
quarter
true-up calculation?  With the uncertainty of the prices in the power market, 
we would
like to just have a side letter to address the end of quarter true-up 
payment.  It also
is possible that we may want to have multilple on-peak  or off-peak agreements
that will be executed.

Feel free to change as needed.

Tanya,
 I have received a guarantee for execution by ena from the london office.  
The Guarantor is Centrica plc; the entities that the Guarantor is 
guaranteeing are Accord Energy Limited and Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited; Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
International Corp.; Enron Canada Corp.; and Enron North America Corp. and 
the Enron entities named whose transactions with the named Guarantor's 
subsidiaries are being guaranteed up to 75 million pounds sterling.  The 
Guarantor can terminate  on five days notice.
 Do we know what type of business ENA intends to do with these entities for 
which this Guaranty has been drafted.  If so, let me know so that I can 
forward to that group for them to approve and obtain ENA's signature.

Stacey Neuweiler asked that I forward this to you so that you could print 2 
copies of each document and give them to her boss for signature.  I have 
reviewed the form of the agreements with Mitch Dutton and agreed that they 
are these transporter's typical form.  If time would permit, I suggested they 
negotiate the penalty language, otherwise the forms are okay.  Call me at 
713-853-6895 if you have any questions.  I am also forwarding the Duke 
documents for you to print off and have signed.
