Late on October 25th, we received information about a nonspecific threat to the Enron Center.  We communicated with law enforcement officials who found the threat unsubstantiated and without merit.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  

Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Subject: a married man left work

A married man left  work early on Friday afternoon. in stead of going
home, however, he  squandered the weekend and his paycheck partying
with the boys. When he  finally returned home on Sunday night, he ran
into a furious  wife.

After a couple of hours of nagging and berating, his wife asked,  how
would you like it if you didn't see me for a couple  days?!!!!

"That would suit me just fine!!!"

So Monday went by,  and the man didn't see his wife. Tuesday and
Wednesday came and went with the  same result. Come Thursday, the
swelling went down a bit and he could see her  a little, just out of
the corner of his left  eye....

One day Satan and Jesus were having a conversation.   Satan had just come
from the Garden of Eden, and he was gloating and boasting.   Yes, sir, I
just  caught the world full of people down there.  Set me a trap, used
bait I knew
they couldn't resist. Got 'em all!"


"What are you going to do with them?" Jesus asked.

Satan  replied, "Oh, I'm gonna have fun! I'm gonna teach them how to marry
and divorce each other, how to hate and abuse each other, how to drink and
smoke and curse.   I'm gonna teach them how to invent guns and bombs and
kill each other. I'm really gonna have fun!"

"And what will you do when you get done with them?"  Jesus asked.

"Oh, I'll kill 'em," Satan glared proudly.

"How much do you want for them?" Jesus asked.

"Oh, you don't want those people. They ain't no good. Why, you'll take
them and they'll just hate you.   They'll spit on you, curse you and kill
you!! You don't want those people!!"

"How much?" Jesus asked again.

Satan looked at Jesus and sneered, "All your tears, and all your blood."

Jesus said, "DONE!"    Then He paid the price.

Isn't it funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder
why the world's going to hell.

Isn't it funny how we believe what the newspapers say, but question what
the Bible says.

Isn't it funny how everyone wants to go to heaven provided they do not
have to believe, think, say, or do anything the Bible says. Or is it
scary?

Isn't it funny how someone can say "I believe in God"  but still follow
Satan (who, by the way also "believes" in God).

Isn't it funny how you can send a thousand jokes through e-mail and they
spread like wildfire, but when you start sending messages regarding the
Lord, people think twice about sharing.

Isn't it funny how the lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene pass freely through
cyberspace, but the public discussion of Jesus is suppressed in the school
and workplace.

Isn't it funny how someone can be! so fired up for Christ on Sunday, but
be an invisible Christian the rest of the week.

Are you laughing?

Isn't it funny how when you go to forward this message, you will not send
it to many on your address list because you're not sure what they believe,
or what they will think of you for sending it to them.

Isn't it funny how I can be more worried about what other people think of
me than what God thinks of me.

Will YOU pass this on? I did

Subject:	PLEASE READ : SAP Reports

Please pass along to all who utilize SAP for reporting in your Business Unit.

SAP Users,

We are experiencing an inordinate strain on the SAP system due to the large volume of reports running.  The ISC has been working this issue since last Thursday, continuously monitoring the system and looking for any potential enhancements to performance or identifying technical issues hindering performance.  The most immediate culprit of system slowdown has been the continual submission of the same 10-15 reports repeatedly throughout the workday.

Please help us, you, and the rest of the Enron community by adhering to the following guidelines:

1) Only execute business critical reports during high traffic times such as financial close workdays 1-6. 
2) Utilize the Sunrise data warehouse where plausible and where up to the minute data (real-time) is not a requirement.
3) Enter as many selection parameters as you are able before executing a report.
4) Limit the amount of data being pulled by a report.  For example, run reports for only one reporting period and/or for one company code.
5) Do NOT run a report multiple times simultaneously.  
If a report is not returning any data in a quick timeframe, please do not resubmit the report without first canceling the original report.
Do not run multiple sessions of the report with different criteria simultaneously.  The report goes after the same table for the data each time.
6) Limit the number of line item reports run.  Run summary reports and then drilldown to the line items as needed.

We will keep you advised of any findings from the technical teams.

Please note that any duplicate reports running under the same ID will be subject to termination.

Thank you in advance for your assistance in report volume reduction.

Subject: FW: Hello Beautiful Person 






If God had a refrigerator, your picture would be on it. 
    If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you 
flowers every spring. 
    He sends you a sunrise every morning. 
  Whenever you want to talk, He listens. 
    He can live anywhere in the universe, but He 
chose ... your heart. 
    Face it, friend -- He is crazy about you! 

 Send this to every "beautiful person" you wish  to bless, and return 
it to the person who sent it to you. 

    God didn't promise days without pain, 
    laughter without sorrow, sun without rain, but He did 
promise strength for the day, comfort for the tears, and light for the 
way.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work.

If you are a participant in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, please read this very important message.

We understand that you are concerned about the timing of the move to a new Savings Plan administrator and the restricted access to your investment funds during the upcoming transition period scheduled to take place beginning at 3:00PM CST on October 26 and ending at 8:00AM CST on November 20.  

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins.

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.
 
David, Cindy and Mary will each report to the Office of the Chairman.  A detailed organizational chart is attached.  Please join me in congratulating David, Cindy and Mary on their new responsibilities.

Move to a leaner Enron

These are the new wire approval requirements:

For Future Fundings:

EPI  - wires must be signed by Kevin Garland

ECR - wires must be signed by John Lavorato



Capital Calls and Facility Wires need to be signed by Joe Deffner


Please include a note on the wire on what the implications are if we do not fund the money.  This does not to be a long explanation.  It can be as simples as a contract default if we do not wire the money.

> 
> If calories are an issue, store your chocolate on top of the fridge.

Dana,

I work for Fred Cohagan in EBS Asia Pac -- and I believe he's spoken to you about the fact that we're scaling back around the region.  

I had mentioned to him that I'd like to get involved with the Power Desk and he suggested that I give you a call.  If you're available, I'd be very interested in talking about any opportunities in your group.

I'll try to reach you on Tuesday afternoon, CST.

Regards,

Pat Leahy

Subject:	Program Changes


As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Earlier today, FERC issued the attached order approving an extension of the=
 NYISO's Automated Mitigation Procedures (also known as the AMP or Circuit =
Breaker) through April 30, 2002, rather than until October 31 as had been s=
ought by the ISO. Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISO's request. =
FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that =
addresses FERC's concerns with the AMP as well as FERC's concerns regarding=
 how the ISO's overall mitigation measures work together. This proposal is =
due by March 1, to be effective May 1.=20
=20
FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already comm=
itted to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail=
 the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a de=
monstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work=
 with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a bar=
rier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be=
 exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources,=
 including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted fro=
m or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted beca=
use their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market p=
ower. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as w=
ell; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how t=
he AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in e=
ffect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is conc=
erned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be i=
nconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures con=
sistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with tr=
ansmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution syste=
m is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the ou=
t-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it ex=
pects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and=
 it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its M=
arch 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.

ORDER APPROVING EXTENSION OF AUTOMATIC MITIGATION PROCEDURES SUBJECT TO CON=
DITIONS
(Issued November 27, 2001)
On September 28, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYIS=
O) filed, pursuant to section 205 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), [1] a req=
uest to extend the termination date for the Automated Mitigation Procedures=
 (AMP) [2] to=20
October 31, 2002.  The Commission's June 28, 2001 order [3] in this proceed=
ing approving the AMP required those automated procedures to expire on Octo=
ber 31, 2001.  In this order, we accept NYISO's proposed extension of the A=
MP until April 30, 2002, and we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitiga=
tion proposal that addresses the Commission's concerns with the AMP set for=
th in this order, as well as our concerns regarding how NYISO's overall mit=
igation measures work together.  NYISO is directed to file the comprehensiv=
e mitigation proposal by March 1, 2002 to be effective May 1, 2002.  The Co=
mmission's action here benefits customers by protecting them from market po=
wer, while establishing procedures to modify and improve the AMP mechanism,=
 as well as other mitigation measures in NYISO.
=20
=20
=20


I.  Procedural Background
=20
In a November 23, 1999 order, [4] the Commission accepted in part and rejec=
ted in part the market monitoring and mitigation plans filed by NYISO.  In =
instances where NYISO concludes that a specific market participant is exerc=
ising market power, the Commission accepted NYISO's proposal to allow it to=
 engage in discussions to resolve the issues informally or issue demand let=
ters requesting the participant cease certain behavior.  In addition, the C=
ommission stated that NYISO could file on a case-by-case basis under sectio=
n 205 of the FPA to impose specific mitigation measures, or to make such fi=
lings based on recurring types of conduct that warrant mitigation.  However=
, the Commission did not allow NYISO to reduce bid flexibility, impose fina=
ncial obligations to pay for operating reserves, or impose default bids, be=
cause this would give too much discretion to NYISO in price-setting and oth=
er similar regulatory functions without Commission review.  The Commission =
determined that NYISO had not described with sufficient specificity the typ=
es of conduct that would trigger the imposition of these measures; it had n=
ot established specific thresholds or bright line tests that would trigger =
the conclusion that market power had been exercised.
=20
In a March 29, 2000 order, [5] the Commission further clarified NYISO's aut=
hority under the plans.  Among other things, the Commission accepted the sp=
ecific thresholds proposed by NYISO to trigger possible mitigation, but rej=
ected NYISO's proposal to keep them confidential.  The Commission also allo=
wed NYISO limited discretion as to when to mitigate (e.g., NYISO may choose=
 not to impose mitigation if it is satisfied with the party's explanation f=
or its behavior) and for how long, but required NYISO to clarify that mitig=
ation for market power may be imposed only prospectively.=20
=20


In a complaint filed in Docket No. EL01-55-000, the Mirant Companies (Miran=
t) alleged that NYISO improperly intended to implement the AMP without fili=
ng any changes to the MMM pursuant to either section 205 or 206 of the FPA.=
  In its May 9, 2001 order on Mirant's complaint, [6] the Commission found =
that part of NYISO's proposal is within the bounds of its existing tariff, =
in that section 3.2(b) of the Market Mitigation Measures (MMM) specifically=
 envisions use of the Security Constrained Unit Commitment (SCUC) [7] to id=
entify questionable conduct.  However, the Commission also found that NYISO=
's AMP proposal needed to be examined in greater detail before it could be =
approved.  Further, the Commission noted that section 205(c) of the FPA req=
uires that NYISO keep on file with the Commission "practices and regulation=
s" affecting its rates, and that NYISO's tariff did not contain language ad=
equately specifying the timing and the process that are contained in the AM=
P.  Accordingly, the Commission concluded, that if NYISO wishes to implemen=
t its AMP proposal, it must file revised tariff sheets pursuant to section =
205 of the FPA to set forth the AMP procedures.  In that filing, the Commis=
sion added, NYISO must address the concerns raised by the parties in the Mi=
rant complaint proceeding, including: (1) whether the AMP provides sufficie=
nt opportunity for meaningful consultation; (2) whether inaccurate market-c=
learing prices will result even if the party whose bid was improperly mitig=
ated is ultimately made whole; (3) whether the AMP would establish a new $1=
50 threshold that never appears in the MMM; and, (4) whether NYISO proposes=
 to exclude hydro units, imports, and exports from the AMP.
=20
On March 17, 2001, in Docket No. ER01-2076-000, NYISO filed a new Attachmen=
t H to its Services Tariff which incorporated the proposed AMP procedures (=
March 17 Filing).  By order issued June 28, 2001, [8] the Commission accept=
ed NYISO's March 17 Filing allowed NYISO to implement the AMP mechanism for=
 2001 summer capability period when supplies may still be tight and when th=
e effectiveness of new demand response mechanisms are uncertain.  The Commi=
ssion viewed the proposed mechanism as only a temporary solution, and agree=
d with certain of the intervenors that the proposed AMP may mitigate bids i=
n situations where market power is not the cause for high or volatile bids,=
 and may not provide for sufficient consultation with generators to reasona=
bly establish that particular bids were attempts to exercise market power. =
 The Commission further explained that automatic market power mitigation ma=
y be most appropriate where it is tied to structural market power problems,=
 such as must-run situations where generators would otherwise be in a posit=
ion to name their price, and noted that both PJM and ISO-NE use this more l=
imited approach to automatic mitigation.
=20
=20


II.  NYISO's Market Mitigation Procedures, Including AMP
=20
          Under Commission orders allowing NYISO to implement its MMM, [9] =
 NYISO's Market Monitoring Unit (MMU), in consultation with NYISO's Market =
Advisor, is responsible for monitoring the markets administered or controll=
ed by NYISO and for mitigating a market party's conduct when NYISO determin=
es that market power has been exercised.  The MMM has specific threshold va=
lues for identifying generators or transmission facilities that exercise ma=
rket power.  NYISO imposes mitigation when a market party's conduct has a m=
aterial effect on prices or on guarantee payments.  Conduct and impact crit=
eria must be satisfied before NYISO may mitigate a generator's bid.  NYISO =
may not mitigate market prices retroactively.=20
=20
Under its manual procedures, prior to implementation of the AMP, NYISO is a=
ble to identify conduct and pricing impacts that exceed the MMM standards o=
nly after the SCUC runs for a given day-ahead market have been completed, w=
hich means that mitigation cannot be implemented until the next day's day-a=
head market.  The primary purpose of the AMP is to eliminate the one-day la=
g inherent in the manual application of the market mitigation thresholds th=
at currently exist in NYISO's market mitigation.  That delay can be importa=
nt when market conditions arise that permit an exercise of market power.  T=
he AMP procedures are activated when the SCUC that calculates day-ahead mar=
ket prices makes a preliminary determination that prices in a given area of=
 New York will exceed $150 absent mitigation. [10]  Once the AMP is activat=
ed, it only mitigates bids if specific thresholds for both bidding conduct =
and market impact are crossed.  The conduct and impact thresholds used by t=
he AMP are the same thresholds approved by the Commission under NYISO's Mar=
ket Mitigation Measures.  Under the automated procedures of the AMP, non-co=
mpetitive bidding behavior is still mitigated prospectively, as authorized =
in the MMM, but the mitigation will occur within the SCUC runs in which the=
 conduct and price effect thresholds of the MMM are crossed, without the on=
e-day delay that occurs under the manual procedures.=20


III.  This Filing
=20
On September 28, 2001, NYISO filed to extend the AMP, which would otherwise=
 expire on October 31, 2001, until October 31, 2002. [11]   NYISO requests =
waiver of the 60-day prior notice requirement to permit a November 1, 2001 =
effective date.  NYISO states that good cause exists for the waiver in orde=
r to prevent a gap in the availability of the AMP.
=20
NYISO believes the performance of the AMP was consistent with its design, w=
hich is to eliminate the delay of one Day-Ahead Market cycle inherent in ma=
nual application of the market mitigation thresholds.  NYISO explains that =
during Summer 2001, prices hit the $150 level 12 times, but the AMP imposed=
 bid caps only four times.  Of those four times, the largest average number=
 of megawatts mitigated was 481, while customers were protected from more t=
hat $11 million in unwarranted energy costs.  NYISO further states that onl=
y twice did AMP mitigation apply to more than one entity in one zone.  NYIS=
O concludes that while the AMP is an automated procedure, it does not autom=
atically apply bid caps whenever prices are high. =20
=20
Absent mitigation, NYISO states that significant unwarranted wealth transfe=
rs from buyers to sellers could take place especially during high-load summ=
er months when supply may be tight.  NYISO asserts however, that transmissi=
on constraints can create tight market conditions in small areas even durin=
g shoulder months.
=20
NYISO states that the conditions necessitating the need for the AMP are alm=
ost certain to be present this coming summer as they were this past summer,=
 and with the potential for market power problems to arise in shoulder peri=
ods as well, it is preferable to keep the AMP in place while improvements a=
re implemented and additional analysis under taken, rather than to summaril=
y terminate the AMP.
=20


NYISO states that the AMP, while working as intended, is subject to improve=
ments.  Specifically, NYISO states that it intends to make two improvements=
 in the AMP prior to Summer 2002.  The proposed modifications will have the=
 effect of narrowing the scope of the AMP to mitigate prices only when mark=
et power exists.   First, NYISO proposes to exclude from mitigation by the =
AMP a Market Participants' bids that trigger the conduct test for mitigatio=
n if the total quantity of those bids is 50 MW or less, unless analysis sho=
ws the relevant units are in a position to exercise market power at those q=
uantity levels.  At present, the AMP excludes bids by bidding entities with=
 50 MW or less of capacity.  NYISO stated the reason for exempting such bid=
s was because the withholding of such small amounts will rarely have a mate=
rial effect on prices.
=20
Second, NYISO proposes to limit mitigation to zones in which the price impa=
ct test for mitigation is met by implementing at least one additional AMP p=
ass in SCUC.  This proposed change would fine-tune the application of the A=

ice impact threshold is exceeded in any hour or any zone, the results of th=

Notice of NYISO's filing was published in the Federal Register, 66 Fed. Reg=
. 51,650 (2001), with comments, protests, and interventions due on or befor=
e October 19, 2001.  Motions to intervene were filed by Constellation Power=
 Source, Inc., et al.; HQ Energy Services (U.S.) (late); the Member Systems=
; [13]  NRG Companies; and the PSEG Companies.  Motions to intervene and co=
mments in support of NYISO's filing were filed by the City of New York; Con=
solidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., and Orange and Rockland Utiliti=
es, Inc. (ConEd); the New York Consumer Protection Board (Consumer Board); =
the New York State Public Service Commission (New York Commission); and the=
 Multiple Intervenors.  Protests and motions to intervene were filed by Aqu=
ila Energy Marketing Corporation, et al. (Aquila);  Dynegy Power Marketing,=
 Inc. (Dynegy); The Electric Power Supply Association (EPSA); Enron Power M=
arketing, Inc. (Enron); The Independent Power Producers of New York, Inc. (=

Pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, 1=
8 C.F.R. ? 385.214 (2001), all the timely motions to intervene are granted =
and all late motions to intervene filed before the issue date of this order=
 are granted.  Granting late intervention at this stage of the proceeding w=
ill not disrupt the proceeding or place additional burdens on existing part=

On October 31, 2001, the New York Commission filed a motion for leave to an=
swer the protests and comments.  Although Rule 213(a)(2) of the Commission'=
s Rules of Practice and Procedure, 18 C.F.R. ? 385.213(a)(2) (2001), genera=
lly prohibit answers to protests, we will accept the New York Commission's =
answer because it helps clarify issues under consideration in this proceedi=
ng.
=20
Intervenor Protests and Comments
=20
Five parties, as identified above, support NYISO's proposal.  New York City=
 believes that the extension of the AMP is a necessary (but not sufficient)=
 measure for mitigating excessive prices.  It maintains that the AMP does n=
ot adequately protect New York City consumers from excessive wholesale pric=
es because it sets too high a trigger for implementing the mitigation, noti=
ng that the AMP was not triggered on August 9, 2001, when day-ahead energy =
prices reached a record $1024/MWH in New York City.  Similarly, ConEd belie=
ves that the AMP remains necessary to prevent or identify and mitigate the =
exercise of market power in New York's day-ahead market.  It asserts that e=
xtending the AMP will permit NYISO to assess further the coordinated operat=
ion of the various mitigation measures that it administers.=20
=20


The New York Commission asserts that the AMP is needed throughout the year,=
  focuses only on high prices caused by market power, and has not unreasona=
bly disadvantaged generators.  It also believes that the AMP complements bu=
t does not duplicate the in-city mitigation measures, remains necessary des=
pite price-capped load bidding and virtual bidding, and conforms to the Com=
mission's preference for ex ante mitigation.  The Consumer Board maintains =
that the fundamental rationale for the AMP has not changed, the AMP is work=
ing as intended and has not unduly interfered with the performance of compe=
titive markets, NYISO has committed to make improvements in the AMP before =
next summer.  The Multiple Intervenors also agree that the AMP is necessary=
 to prevent the exercise of market power and believe that the Commission sh=
ould encourage NYISO to continue to improve the AMP. =20
=20
Eight parties, as identified above, filed protests concerning NYISO's propo=
sal.  Mirant asserts that NYISO has not shown the AMP is needed or addresse=
d the flaws in the AMP identified by the Commission.  It also states that t=
he AMP resulted in the improper mitigation of economically justifiable bids=
 during the 2001 Summer Capability Period and is likely to harm consumers b=
y discouraging efficient supply-side and demand-side decisions.  EPSA and W=
illiams make similar arguments.  EPSA further asserts that mitigation measu=
res should not be a part of the discussions to form a Northeastern RTO.  Th=
e Independent Producers maintain that the AMP is flawed because it improper=
ly mitigates bids that do not cross the impact threshold required for mitig=
ation, and because it mitigates a generator's bids for quantities that are =
not large enough to represent an exercise of market power.  They further st=
ate that some units were improperly mitigated as a result of flawed calcula=
tions of reference level curves, that the AMP has not been tied to structur=
al market power problems, and that the AMP improperly inhibits ICAP generat=
ors from managing their risk by choosing whether to sell in the day-ahead o=
r in the real-time market.  Enron supports the protests of EPSA and the Ind=
ependent Producers.
=20
Aquila makes many of the arguments described above and also asserts that NY=
ISO's AMP extension request ignores the improvements in market conditions t=
hat have occurred over the summer of 2001.  Aquila maintains that at a mini=
mum, the Commission should deny NYISO's request to continue the AMP, withou=
t prejudice to a subsequent filing by NYISO that address the flaws with the=
 current version of the AMP.  Keyspan suggests as an alternative that the A=
MP should only be extended until April 30, 2002, and only if the 50 MW exem=
ption is extended, the consultation process is revised, a structural power =
screen is added, and a firm timetable for completion of the items discussed=
 in NYISO's filing is provided.  =20
=20


In addition to arguments made by other protesters, Dynegy asserts that the =
AMP has not worked as designed, and that on August 9, 2001, 22 of its day-a=
head market bids for August 10 for its Roseton Units 1 and 2 had been mitig=
ated.  Dynegy maintains that these should not have been mitigated since the=
y did not cross the "conduct threshold" in NYISO's MMP, and that Dynegy sti=
ll has not received a direct explanation from NYISO as to why its bids were=
 mitigated, although recent NYISO reports and statements indicate that a mi=
stake was made with respect to Dynegy's bids.  Dynegy states that an explan=
ation of the performance of the AMP was provided in a memorandum (now avail=
able on NYISO's website) made available to those that attended a joint meet=
ing of the Scheduling & Pricing Working Group and the Market Structures Wor=
king Group held on October 9, 2001.  According to Dynegy, at that meeting, =
NYISO claimed that the AMP worked as designed since the coding for the comp=
uter programs worked as intended, although certain upstream data inputs cau=
sed Dynegy's bids to be improperly mitigated.  Further, Dynegy asserts that=
 NYISO has dropped the $100 million day price spike (June 26, 2000) as just=
ification for the AMP and now concedes that the price spike was due to seam=
s problems.
=20
Answers=20
=20
In its answer, the New York Commission reaffirms its support for the propos=
ed extension of the AMP until October 31, 2002.  The New York Commission st=
ates that the AMP is necessary to ensure that wholesale prices are just and=
 reasonable in light of the tight supply situation and transmission constra=
ints that continue to exist in New York. =20
In response to the arguments presented by the generators opposing the exten=
sion of the AMP, the New York Commission submits that: the AMP adequately d=
istinguishes between high prices associated with market power and high pric=
es associated with scarcity;  the AMP properly evaluates the combined impac=
t of generators; and the AMP is needed through the year, not just during th=
e summer capability period during high load periods, given transmission con=
straints and scheduled and unscheduled outages during shoulder months.  Fin=
ally, in response to generators' concerns that the AMP may mitigate in cert=
ain situations where mitigation should not have taken place, the New York C=
ommission says that it is just as important to protect against the occurren=
ce of market power that goes unmitigated should the AMP not be extended.  A=
bsent the AMP, the New York Commission states the harm of permitting unmiti=
gated market power would be far greater than any harm caused by improper mi=
tigation.  The New York Commission compares the $11 million withheld from g=
enerators as a result of the AMP being in effect during Summer 2001 with th=
e $100 million resulting from a single day of unmitigated market power in 2=
000.
=20
V.  Discussion
=20
NYISO has proposed to extend the same AMP the Commission approved in the Ju=
ne 28 Order, without modification.  NYISO states that it is committed to ma=
king further refinements to narrow the impact of the mitigation performed u=
nder the AMP and states it is committed to making what it refers to as two =
major improvements prior to Summer 2002:  limiting the mitigation to specif=
ic zones and hours that fail the impact test and exempting bids of less tha=
n 50 MW unless there is a demonstrated market power concern.               =
                             =20
=20


Our review of the AMP indicates that it appropriately attempts to distingui=
sh between  market power and scarcity.  The AMP closes the one day lag inhe=
rent in the manual application of mitigation measures in the current MMM an=
d thus advances the ability of NYISO to mitigate market power.  Implementat=
ion of the AMP is not without concerns, however.  The AMP, as noted by NYIS=
O and other market participants, requires some refinements and additional r=
eview, e.g., determination of Reference Prices, unnecessary mitigation, app=
lication to energy limited resources. =20
=20
Also, AMP may be one of the many barriers to entry for new generating facil=
ities.  We direct NYISO to work with market participants, especially the Ne=
w York Commission, to examine barriers to entry for new generation.  As par=
t of this process, the NYISO may consider exempting new generators from AMP=
 in its March filing.  We note that generators in PJM have an exemption fro=
m must-run mitigation.  If NYISO chooses to exempt new units, NYISO should =
address whether the exemption would encourage more rapid entry of new gener=
ators and the effect of such exemption would have on NYISO's comprehensive =
mitigation proposal.
=20
NYISO proposes to exempt hydro units from the AMP.  NYISO believes that hyd=
ro units should not be subject to such mitigation because their volatile bi=
ds often reflect their opportunity costs, not market power.  The Commission=
 believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources, including tho=
se constrained by environmental rules.  Therefore, we direct NYISO to work =
with market participants to determine whether there are other energy limite=
d resources and to develop an appropriate accommodation within the AMP proc=
edures.  This coordination should develop both standing protocols as well a=
s an accounting for possible day-to-day considerations affecting bids.     =
                                                                      =20
=20
Accordingly, we will extend the AMP until April 30, 2002, subject to the fo=
llowing conditions.  We note that NYISO has already indicated that it is co=
mmitted to working with market participants to determine if other refinemen=
ts or changes in the AMP design should be considered.  We direct NYISO meet=
 with market participants and to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal w=
hich addresses the Commission's concerns expressed in this order concerning=
 the AMP, as well as explain how AMP will work in conjunction with other mi=
tigation measures already in effect or proposed for NYISO. [14]=20


In this regard, we note that NYISO has several mitigation measures in place=
 or proposed, including its existing MMM and its proposed AMP, as well as  =
In-City mitigation.   We are concerned that these measures may not fully fi=
t together in a way that adequately addresses market power problems while a=
voiding unnecessary mitigation.  On the one hand, these measure may not mit=
igate all significant exercises of market power.  For example, the existing=
 MMM allows suppliers to exercise market power for one day before mitigatio=
n goes into effect.  On the other hand, other measures may create the poten=
tial for unnecessary mitigation.=20
=20
We also direct NYISO to consider must-run mitigation measures consistent wi=
th ISO-NE and PJM.  The  In-City mitigation measures address market power p=
roblems created by transmission constraints into New York City, but not tho=
se created by transmission constraints within New York City or elsewhere.  =
PJM and ISO-NE both have mitigation measures which provide for automatic mi=
tigation in defined must-run situations. =20
=20
Accordingly, we direct NYISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal by=
 March 1, 2002 to be effective May 1, 2002.  When developing a comprehensiv=
e mitigation plan, NYISO should bear in mind that the Commission expects on=
e mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process. Therefore, =
we strongly urge NYISO to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating it=
s comprehensive mitigation plan.=20

Today was a very difficult day for us as market uncertainty continued.  Recent news reports, including The Wall Street Journal article today, have speculated about possible mergers, takeovers and equity investors as options that Enron is considering.  The reason you have not seen us responding to these reports is that it is our corporate policy not to comment on market speculation.  However, I will tell you that we are evaluating all options to protect the financial stability of this company.  I will keep you updated on developments as they occur.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

As you know, Enron, its directors, and certain current and former officers are defendants in litigation in Federal and State court involving the LJM partnerships.

Enron has employed counsel and they will represent Enron and its interests in the litigation.

Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, we are required to preserve documents that might be used in the litigation. 

Accordingly, our normal document destruction policies are suspended immediately and shall remain suspended until further notice.

Please retain all documents (which include handwritten notes, recordings, e-mails, and any other method of information recording) that in any way relate to the Company's related party transactions with LJM 1 and LJM 2, including, but not limited to, the formation of these partnerships, any transactions or discussions with the partnerships or its agents, and Enron's accounting for these transactions.

You should know that this document preservation requirement is a requirement of Federal law and you could be individually liable for civil and criminal penalties if you fail to follow these instructions.

You should know that Enron will defend these lawsuits vigorously.  In the meantime, you should not discuss matters related to the lawsuits with anyone other than the appropriate persons at Enron and its counsel.  

If you have any questions, please contact Jim Derrick at 713-853-5550.

GMAT REVIEW AT ENRON

The next GMAT review course at Enron will begin Monday, November 26th:
The schedule is:
     Course # 7019-00:  Monday nights, Nov 26 - Jan 28 (no class Dec 24 or
Dec 31)

This course is identical to the courses that started in October.  It is
being offered now for the benefit of employees who would like to take the
GMAT before January 31 for the purposes of applying to business school.

Course details:
     - Class is held at Enron in room ECN560 and is restricted to Enron
		employees
     - Each course is limited to eight students
     - Meets once a week for eight weeks
     - Hours are 6:00-9:00 PM (first session will run til 10:00 pm to
          include initial exam)
     - Expect 4-5 hours of homework per week
     - Course includes a total of four practice GMAT exams
     - Ends the second week of December, allowing employees to take the
          GMAT in December and meet a January application deadline.
     - Special discount of $200 off the regular Princeton Review tuition

Enron has allowed this program to be hosted in the Enron Building for
convenience of its employees.  Individuals are responsible for paying their
own fees.  Financial support from Enron is at manager's discretion and is
subject to the usual tuition reimbursement constraints around budget and
relevance to organizational performance.


HOW TO ENROLL:
     1.  Print out the attached registration form.
     2.  Complete the form, but please note the following
          SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS:
          A.  Fill out the student information completely, including
               your email address.
          B.  In the Enrollment section, where it says "Please enroll
               me in GMAT Class Size-8 Course # _________",
          C.  In the Payment section:  For the course at Enron, the
               tuition is discounted by $200, to $899.
               FULL PAYMENT of this amount by credit or debit card is
required on the registration form.  Be sure to indicate complete cardholder
information.
     3.  Fax the completed form to Princeton Review at (713) 688-4746.

Faxes are time-stamped by the receiving fax machine at Princeton Review.
The first eight valid registration forms received for each course will be
honored.  Registrations received after the first eight will be placed on a
waiting
list for the course or courses indicated.  Enrollments and waitlists will be
confirmed by email.

Employees who are not able to take the course at Enron can take a course at
the Princeton Review office at the same $200 discount.  
Call (800)2REVIEW to register or to receive a list of course schedules.

IMPORTANCE OF THE GMAT:
     The GMAT score is a critical part of your application to business
school.  Indeed, in many cases, it is the single most decisive statistic
that admissions offices use in evaluating applicants.  While work
experience, GPA, essays, and interviews are all important components of
your application, the GMAT is the one objective factor that you can
substantially improve in a short period of time.

THE TEXAS MBA TOUR:
     All interested Enron employees are invited to attend the Texas MBA
Tour, which will be in Houston on Wednesday, January 23. The Texas MBA
Tour, of which The Princeton Review is a partner, is a group of six business
schools that host a joint MBA panel discussion and admissions fair.  The
participating schools are Texas, Rice, SMU, Baylor, TCU, and Texas A&M.
The Princeton Review has agreed to handle registration for the event, so
call
(800) 2REVIEW to register.

Sent:	Friday, November 09, 2001 5:57 PM
To:	DL-GA-ALL_enron_worldwide5
Subject:	Enron Announces Plans to Merge with Dynegy


Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

As you know, Enron Net Works (ENW) and Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) recently executed a two-year agreement, whereby MCI WorldCom would serve as Enron's primary telecommunications provider.  In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

I really really want to get out of here.  I was just told by my admin. that when I get here at 6:45 am that Renee gets in a little after me and is watching me, so I need to be careful of what I do.  What do they think I do play around.  This makes me so mad, I could scream.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Good Morning,

I pray that all is well with you this morning. I wanted to share a
prophetic word with you on this morning that went forth after our Building
Fund committee meeting last night. (As shared with me by our First Lady,
Edith Wallace).

Bro Andrew shared a word that we as a people are to follow our Moses that
God has given us and that God is calling all things to order. He stated
that when the Pastor speaks and gives a word of instructions, we are to
listen and stop bickering amongst ourselves like the children of Israel and
follow the man of God.

He, Bro Andrew stated that God said that if we as a church would unite and
pray for the Pastor and his wife for the next 21 days at 3:00 and everyone
be on one accord, God said that He would move mightily.

This will be shared in an announcement on Sunday to let the
church know, this would be in line of things and that the church needs to
get to a point of obedience, because one of the reason why the church has
gone around the mountain is because things have been out of order.

God is an awesome God and we want to give Him thanks for what He doing.
Please forward this information to as many people with contact information
before Sunday. Because this is something that we as a people can begin
doing today and share the Word with the congregation on Sunday.

Have a wonderful God Blessed Day,
Denise

A woman named Frances once knew a young person at church named Debbie.
Debbie always seemed effervescent and happy, although Frances knew she had
faced struggles in  her life.
Her long-awaited marriage had quickly ended  in divorce.  She had struggled
to get a grip on her single  life. She hadn't chosen it, but she  decided
she would live it with  utmost enjoyment and satisfaction.
Debbie was active in Sunday  school, in the choir, as a leader  of the
junior high girls' group, and in the church renewal movement. Frances
enjoyed knowing Debbie. Debbie's whole face seemed to  smile and she always
greeted  Frances with a hug.
One day Frances asked Debbie, "How is it  that you are always so happy?  You
have so much energy, and you never seem to get down?"  With her eyes
smiling, Debbie said, "I  know the secret!"  "What  secret is that?" What
are you talking about?" Frances asked.
Debbie replied, "I'll tell you all about  it, but you have to promise to
share the 'secret' with others." Frances agreed, "Okay, now what is it?" The
secret is this: I have learned there is little I can do in  my life that
will make me truly  happy. I must depend on God to make  me happy and meet
my needs. When a need arises in my life, I have to trust God to supply
according to HIS riches. I have learned most of  the time I don't need half
of what  I think I do.
HE has never let me down. Since I learned that  secret I am happy.  Frances'
first thought was, That's too simple! But upon reflecting over her own life
she recalled how she thought a bigger house would make  her happy-but it
didn't! She  thought a better-paying job would  make her happy-but it
hadn't.
When did she realize her  greatest happiness?  Sitting on the floor with her
grandchildren, eating pizza and watching a movie a simple gift from God.
Debbie knew the secret, Frances learned the secret,  and now you know it
too!  We can't depend on  people to make us happy-only GOD in his wisdom can
do that. Trust him.
And now I pass the secret on  to you! So once you get it, whatcha  gonna do?
YOU have to tell someone the secret, too! That GOD  in his wisdom will take
care of  you

Trade press, recruiting firms and others recently have made numerous calls to Enron employees seeking information about the company, its employees and other matters.  In some cases, these callers have used false identities, as in, "I'm from the SEC and I need you to provide me with?"

If you receive a call from someone identifying themselves as part of a government organization, please refer the caller to the legal department.  Please refer calls from the trade press and other media inquiries to the Public Relations group.  And otherwise, please treat Enron information as confidential.

Thank you.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you.

Did you go to church?  We had a Seeds of Praise meeting on yesterday.  Denise said that she was not aware that I had left VM.  I can't imagine that she didn't know.

Hello Dana, 
Hope everything is going well for you.  Are you learning allot of things?  Well I had a question regarding a deposit you made, it's for $184,936.97 Hanson Production.  Did you sent that to treasury?  Did you give it to someone in particular?  It has not hit any bank and it was dated Oct 30.  Please help.

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =

ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.
