As evidenced by an exceptionally strong performance in the second quarter,=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy businesses in North America and Europe continue=
 to=20
experience tremendous growth.  The opportunities to continue to grow our=20
natural gas and power businesses have never been better and it is critical =
to=20
Enron=01,s future success that we remain focused on expanding these busines=
ses=20
and maintaining the strong momentum we have in these markets.

It is equally important that we continue to develop new businesses outside =
of=20
gas and electricity, which can make significant contributions to our earnin=
gs=20
growth.  We have made significant progress in developing these businesses i=
n=20
North America, Europe, and most recently in our new Net Works business unit=
. =20
Included in these global businesses are our efforts in crude and products,=
=20
coal, emissions, insurance, currency, equity trading, interest rates, credi=
t=20
trading, paper and pulp, and metals.

While significant progress has been made in these efforts we need to=20
accelerate the growth of these new businesses while continuing to=20
aggressively expand our core gas and electricity businesses in North Americ=
a=20
and Europe.  In order to accomplish these two objectives and to capitalize =
on=20
the increasingly global opportunities in these new businesses we are today=
=20
announcing the formation of a new business unit =01) Enron Global Markets. =
 This=20
new business unit will focus on markets and commodities which are global in=
=20
scope, but outside our traditional gas and power markets.  This new core=20
business unit will operate in parallel with and in close coordination with=
=20
the North American and European businesses.

Enron Global Markets will be headed by Mike McConnell, President and Chief=
=20
Executive Officer, and Jeff Shankman, Chief Operating Officer.  They will=
=20
report to Mark Frevert who will be Chairman of Enron Global Markets.  Mark,=
=20
Mike and Jeff will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron Global=20
Markets.

Included in this new business unit and reporting to the Office of the=20
Chairman will be the following businesses and their leaders:
- Global Crude and Products:     John Nowlan
- Coal:         George McClellan
- Currency, equities, interest rate and agricultural trading:  Gary Hickers=
on
- Insurance and weather:      Jere Overdyke

Enron=01,s metals business and Enron Credit.com will remain the responsibil=
ity=20
of Enron Europe. The Paper and Pulp business will continue to reside in Nor=
th=20
America.=20

With the departure of Mike McConnell from Enron Net Works, we are pleased t=
o=20
announce the following appointments in that business unit:
- Jeff McMahon: President and Chief Operating Officer
- Louise Kitchen: Chief Commercial Officer
- Philippe Bibi:  Chief Technology Officer

Jeff, Louise and Philippe, along with Greg Whalley,  will comprise the Offi=
ce=20
of the Chairman for Enron Net Works.

With Jeff Shankman=01,s departure from Enron North America=01,s natural gas=
=20
operation, all of Jeff=01,s direct reports will report to John Lavorato.

We are also pleased to announce the following changes to the Enron North=20
America Office of the Chairman.  John Lavorato will join the ENA Office of=
=20
the Chairman as Chief Operating Officer.  Dave Delainey will assume the rol=
e=20
of President and Chief Executive Officer.  Mark Frevert will retain his rol=
e=20
as Chairman of Enron North America in addition to his role as Chairman of=
=20
both Enron Global Markets and Enron Europe.

Please join us in congratulating everyone in their new assignments and in=
=20
supporting the new Enron Global Markets organisation.

I am sorry to inform the group that Aleck has resigned, effective immediately, from Enron to accept a positon with Centrica(formerly British Gas) as Senior V.P. of Regulatory Affairs for North America( based in Toronto). Aleck has done an outstanding job in his 4 1/2 years with the company and will be missed very much professionally. Personally, Aleck has been a pleasure to work with and defines the word gentleman- I will miss Aleck, but look forward to working with him in his new capacity. I'm sure I speak for the entire group in wishing him the very best in all his future endeavors.

Why don't I send it out to all of the group for East and West.  I don't think 
we need to discuss East or West group leads since that may be switching 
around once we hire a new person for the NE.  In addition, I think this 
appropriately emphasizes that everyone needs to be coordinating with all 
others, rather than placing that on a group lead.  If you agree, I'll send it 
out today.

If organizational changes that are announced together are expected to be=20
bound together by a common theme, then this announcement may fall a bit=20
short.  The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government=20
Affairs organization has, however, necessitated certain modest organization=
al=20
shifts and additions, many of which have already occurred or have been in=
=20
transition for the last several weeks.  Rather than attempting to explain t=
he=20
rationale for each change in this memo, instead, I will briefly describe th=
em=20
(attached is a revised organizational chart and map), and offer to answer a=
ny=20
questions anyone might have.

While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me in the role of policy=
=20
development and coordination, she has been and will be spending a=20
considerable amount of her time on broadband and communications issues and=
=20
will also report to Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere in that capacity.
Steve Montovano will assume responsibility for an additional six southeaste=
rn=20
states, including responsibility for SERC.  Marchris Robinson and Tom=20
Chapman, who has agreed to join the group on a more permanent basis as a=20
Senior Regulatory Specialist, will report to Steve.  Ron McNamara has also=
=20
joined Steve=01,s group and will focus on the tight power pools in the Nort=
heast=20
U.S.
Janine Migden will assume responsibility for the states of Tennessee,=20
Arkansas, and Louisiana as well as issues related to TVA.  Bill Moore will=
=20
now report to Janine.
In order to assure more intraregional coordination in the West, Mary Hain,=
=20
who supports ENA=01,s trading desk in Portland, now reports to Paul Kaufman=
.
With Kathleen Magruder=01,s recent departure to ResCo, we are actively sear=
ching=20
for an individual to direct our efforts in Texas and Oklahoma as well as ou=
r=20
efforts at ERCOT and the Southeast Power Pool.
Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere have each done an outstanding job supportin=
g=20
Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will=20
share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas.  They wil=
l=20
also assume responsibility within the group for Enron=01,s E-Commerce effor=
ts in=20
the Americas.  In addition to Sue Nord, the group will consist of Tracy=20
McLaughlin, who supports Scott in Portland, Xi Xi, an analyst who joined us=
=20
early this year in Houston and Lara Leibman who has just joined the group. =
=20
Lara will also continue her activities relative to the Department of Justic=
e=20
and the Federal Trade Commission.
Ricardo Charvel, in addition to his responsibilities in Mexico, will assume=
=20
overall responsibility for Central America, the Caribbean Basin as well as=
=20
Columbia and Venezuela.  Reporting to Ricardo are Alberto Levy, who is=20
primarily responsible for Venezuela and Columbia and Vinio Floris, who=20
recently joined us from Azurix, who will be primarily responsible for Centr=
al=20
America and the Caribbean Basin.
Tom Delaney will now report to Jeff Brown and will support him in our=20
continuing efforts to bring additional reform and standardization to=20
wholesale power markets in the U.S.  Damon Harvey has also joined Jeff=01,s=
=20
group as an analyst.
Gloria Ogenyi, Thane Twiggs and Robert Neustaedter have all joined Harry=20
Kingerski=01,s group to enhance that group=01,s ability to provide rates an=
d other=20
regulatory services throughout the Americas.
With Tom Reichelderfer=01,s departure, Susan Covino will be the sole coordi=
nator=20
for the government affairs group=01,s contractual relationship with ResCo. =
=20
Susan will also begin to get involved in other projects over the next sever=
al=20
weeks.
The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter=20
organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting direct=
ly=20
to Joe Hillings.  Functional assignments, which are reflected on one of the=
=20
attachments, have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to=
=20
their efforts, with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy,=
=20
broadband services and e-commerce-based business activities and a refocusin=
g=20
of the group=01,s efforts in support of commercial groups globally to bette=
r=20
align them with the near and mid-term objectives of the regional commercial=
=20
groups throughout the world.   On a separate note, Tom Briggs will be joini=
ng=20
the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer.  We a=
re=20
pleased to have Tom, who has most recently been in London in the Enron Euro=
pe=20
Government Affairs group, join the Federal Government Affairs team.

Please join me in welcoming, congratulating, and wishing well the individua=
ls=20
noted in this memo.=20

 One final thought.  As we are quickly approaching the mid-point of the yea=
r=20
2000, we must stay constantly  focused on our overall group objectives for=
=20
the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives (see attach=
ed=20
'Top 10' objectives for U.S. & Canada).  With that said, the hard work and=
=20
dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed.  As t=
he=20
group has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the=
=20
regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an=20
individual basis with many of you.  My respect, gratitude and affection for=
=20
the people in this group only grows, however, with time.  Our collective=20
task, while both challenging and intellectually stimulating, is also quite=
=20
daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as the company=20
continues to grow and prosper.  We must continue to work hard to meet our=
=20
objectives, but we must also find a way to keep our work and jobs in their=
=20
proper perspective and to have fun during the journey.  Whatever I can do t=
o=20
help meet those objectives I will do, and, of course, am always open to=20
suggestions in that regard. =20

Thank you

Recently, I asked you to "Lay It On the Line" and tell me what you believe are the most critical issues that we need to address.  Many of you responded, and I want to share the survey results with you.  Additionally, I want to share with you the things we are currently doing or plan to do to move Enron forward.

First, let's take a look at the survey results.

In just three days, more than 4,000 employees completed the survey.  I sincerely appreciate your participation.

I.  We asked you to identify the top five issues facing Enron today.  The responses were:

1.	Stock price
2.	The PRC
3.	Employee/internal morale
4.	External reputation and image
5.	"Walking the talk" of integrity and respect
_________________________________________________________________________________________

II.  We asked you general questions about working at Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	% of employees responding
	strongly agree/agree:
I am committed to staying at Enron.	64.1%
Enron is a company I would invest my money in.	60.1%
I am treated with respect.	60.0%
I would recommend Enron as a place to work for friends and family.	59.1%
I have talents and skills that Enron is not fully utilizing.	54.7%
Enron truly encourages people to take risks.	47.5%
My immediate supervisor has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	46.6%
Executive management has a clear view of where Enron is going and how to get there.	41.6%

_________________________________________________________________________________________

III.  We asked you to what extent you would associate the following attributes to Enron, comparing 2001 to 2000.


	More	Same	Less	N/A

Trustworthy	14.9%	39.0%	36.9%	9.2%	
Arrogant	39.1%	32.4%	13.3%	15.2%	
Self-serving	41.9%	38.6%	7.5%	12.0%	


_________________________________________________________________________________________
IV.  Finally, we asked you to identify the top three things you like about working at Enron.

1.	People (the high quality of people at Enron was the most widely-cited aspect):
---	talented
---	creative
---     learn from one another
2.	Culture and reputation:
---	innovative spirit
---   willingness to be aggressive and take risks
---   ability to embrace change
---   involvement in community
3.	Work environment:

---   true meritocracy
---   unlimited opportunities

_________________________________________________________________________________________

The results of our survey confirmed for the Management Committee and me the great things you feel about Enron and also what you see as the issues we must address to move Enron forward.  The following are some of the things we're doing now or going to do in the next few days and weeks to address the top five issues you identified.  Keep in mind this is only the beginning of an ongoing effort to address your concerns and engage your feedback.

Now, here's what we're going to do based on your feedback.

STOCK PRICE

We are all concerned about our stock price, which has declined significantly this year.  The primary reasons for the sharp decline from our highs earlier this year include:
---	A decline in the overall market and economy;
---   Certain Enron-specific issues, such as California, India and recent management turnover;
---   A "meltdown" in the broadband sector, which may have been as much as $30-$40 of our stock price at the high;
---   Lower energy commodity prices and volatility relative to last winter's high; and
---   Concerns over the pace of energy deregulation.

These concerns mask the strong underlying recurring earnings growth in our transportation and distribution, wholesale and retail businesses.  Very few companies have demonstrated the earnings growth, and future earnings growth, as has Enron.  We fundamentally believe that if we focus on continued earnings growth and reestablishing the confidence of our financial investors, our stock price will reflect the value these businesses deserve.

---	Over the past month, we have met with all of our major institutional shareholders and all of our analysts, reviewing the strong prospects in each of our businesses.
---	We have also committed to provide more segmented information about our business units and how we operate so that analysts have a better understanding of our businesses and how we make money.
We also want to make sure that employees know what we are doing going forward:
---	Mark Koenig, executive vice president of Investor Relations, will host Brown Bag sessions with groups of employees to discuss stock price issues and answer questions.  He will also continue to host eSpeak sessions to answer employee questions.
--- Greg Whalley, Mark Frevert and I will also hold discussions with various groups of employees, which will be taped and made available to employees worldwide.  Watch for these events.

THE PRC

The relative discussion of talent is absolutely critical to maintain our business and our meritocracy.  Understanding which employees have demonstrated the greatest contribution and behaviors, which individuals should be given greater responsibility and leadership, and identifying our top and bottom talent are essential to achieve our business objectives.  Nevertheless, we recognize that certain aspects of the PRC may have caused some of you concern, and we believe we can improve, refine, streamline and better clarify the process objectives for everyone.

Therefore, we will make the following changes to the PRC process prior to year-end:
---	Effective immediately, relative performance discussions will occur annually at year-end.  However, business units will have the flexibility to determine if they need to have those discussions more frequently.
---    The current preferred distribution will no longer be required across Enron.  Business units will be asked to identify only their top 10% and bottom 10% performers for review by Enron's Office of the Chairman annually at year-end.
---   We will continue to use the PEP 360 degree feedback system as input into performance feedback once a year for all employees.  We will also reinforce to all supervisory employees the absolute necessity of continual communication and feedback to their direct reports throughout the year.
---   Finally, we have formed an employee task force that will give us feedback on future changes.

In the November issue of Enron Business, we will feature the first in a series of articles discussing our performance evaluation process.  In addition, there will be other communication and training that will occur prior to year-end.

EMPLOYEE MORALE

We believe the stock price, our external reputation and the performance review process have all affected morale.  Additionally, some employees have indicated they do not feel that they have a place to go to voice their ideas and concerns.  Effective immediately, we will provide an additional resource for employees who do not currently feel comfortable going to either their supervisor or their Human Resources (HR) rep.
---	We are establishing a new business function we are calling Employee Relations (ER) that will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.  Cindy Olson will head this function.  More details of how this group and HR will operate will be communicated in the next few days.
Over the long term, we want our managers to address employee issues and concerns and therefore are providing the following leadership training for those with supervisory roles.
---	We will encourage vice presidents and above, as well as other current and emerging leaders, to complete Executive Impact & Influence training.  These sessions are designed to improve leadership skills such as coaching and effective communication that have a direct impact on performance and managing people.
---	Additionally, we will encourage every employee with supervisory responsibilities to complete online communications training via Communicate!, which will be rolled out immediately.  Communicate! is an interactive training course that uses Enron scenarios and a combination of video, voice mails, e-mails and meetings notes, to analyze user performance based on a participant's responses and actions.

EXTERNAL REPUTATION

We all recognize that our external reputation has suffered this year.  The single most important factor that influences our reputation is our actions - how we act and how we communicate those actions as a company and as individual employees.  We recognize that as Enron's ambassador's in the marketplace, the more you know about our strategy, performance and challenges, the more you can help disseminate accurate information about our company.  To ensure you are better informed:
---	We will do a better job providing you with timely information about issues affecting Enron.  In addition to our existing communication efforts, like e-mail messages and internal publications eBiz and Enron Business, we will post a Q&A on current issues on the Enron intranet at home.enron.com <http://home.enron.com>.  This will give us a consistent message across the organization and will equip you with information when talking to your customers.
--- As we said before, Greg, Mark and I, as well as members of our Management Committee, will meet with groups of employees across Enron to hear your thoughts and share with you our business direction and challenges.  Look for these to start in mid-October.

INTEGRITY & RESPECT

I believe, as I said previously, we need to reinforce our core values, particularly integrity and respect.  From what you have told us in this survey, you agree.
---	Enron's values will have more importance in each employee's evaluation and feedback.  We ask that all employees, regardless of level, hold themselves accountable for the way they interact with people on a daily basis.  We are all responsible for how we treat our coworkers and customers.
---	We will also conduct employee focus groups on a frequent basis to gather additional, specific feedback on employee issues like ethics, integrity and individual concerns.  If you would like to participate in these focus groups, please send an e-mail to Cindy Olson.
---   Periodically, I will host a special feature column in Enron Business to keep you informed of the action steps we are taking and their results.

Finally, I give you my commitment that we will do a better job giving you more information regarding Enron's strategy and challenges, and listening to your concerns and ideas.  But we would ask for your commitment, too.  We need your dedication to Enron and its values, as it is only through your commitment that we will achieve long-term success.  We will conduct another employee survey early next year.  Please continue to send me your feedback and let's continue to work together and keep Enron one of the best places to work in the world.

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

 In order to better align our resources with the business units we support, 
we are designating the following individuals as operating company leads with 
primary responsibility for designing and implementing government and 
regulatory affairs support for the operating companies and to serve as 
primary contacts for the operating companies:

  EBS: Scott Bolton & Donald Lassere

  EES: Harry Kingerski

  ENA: Jim Steffes

 In addition to supporting the operating company organizations, these 
individuals will report to Rick Shapiro.  Jim Steffes will retain his 
responsibilities for regulatory risk assessment and will continue to report 
to Steve Kean in that capacity.

 There are already numerous working relationships and points of contact 
between government affairs and the operating companies.  The designation of 
Scott, Donald, Harry and Jim as leads does not change that.  Rather, we are 
looking to these individuals to coordinate these activities and serve as a 
"go to" resource on issues which impact the respective operating companies.

The Government Affairs group communicates Enron's interests to government 
officials and policymakers in multiple countries throughout the world and at 
all levels of government - multinational, federal, state, and local.  
Our mission is four-fold:  
(1) advocate through administrative, political, and regulatory channels 
Enron's vision for competitive and open markets in the energy and 
telecommunications industries, 
(2) support deal teams in securing the necessary regulatory approvals and 
permission for complex transactions, 
(3) manage all global regulatory risk inherent within our business dealings, 
and 
(4) develop innovative opportunities for Enron's businesses.

		 Subject: Government Affairs-The Americas Promotions


I am very pleased to announce the following promotions that became effective 
February 1, 2001. 

Steve Montovano - Sr. Director to Vice President: Steve, as regional head for 
the Eastern Seaboard area, has developed a very effective team that has 
brought a very commercially focused approach to their efforts in that region. 
Steve and his team have developed a model approach to transactional support 
and origination that has made them an integral part of the commercial teams 
that work in his region. Steve's efforts have been recognized by all, 
particularly his commercial counterparts in the region.

Jeff Dasovich - Director to Sr. Director: As part of the Western States team, 
Jeff has helped to coordinate Enron's actions in response to California's 
energy crisis.  Throughout this crisis he has worked closely with Enron 
Energy Services, Enron North America and senior management of the company in 
a way that fully reflects Enron's core values.  He has provided and continues 
to provide leadership on complex issues involving business and litigation 
risk.  Jeff has also provided tremendous value to the business units on a 
number of transactions arising from the crisis. 

Steve Walton - Director to Sr. Director:  Steve, as part of the group within 
Government Affairs focusing on wholesale market issues, has provided 
extraordinary leadership with respect to the development of RTO's in the 
Western United States.  Steve's insights and experiences have also proven to 
be invaluable in the group's national efforts.

Lisa Yoho - Director to Sr. Director: Lisa has been a valuable member of the 
Eastern Seaboard team and , more recently has assumed responsibility for 
Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks. Lisa has been an integral team 
member in trying to establish a market for secondary rail transportation 
capacity and in helping to launch the company's efforts into  the 
agricultural commodity business. In  these and many other efforts in which 
Lisa has been involved, Lisa has consistently demonstrated substantive 
leadership and excellence.

Donna Fulton - Manager to Director:  Donna joined Governmental Affairs this 
past summer, and has made excellent contributions to our RTO efforts, the 
sale of Portland General, and various commercial endeavors ranging from gas 
matters to licensing of a hydroelectric project in California.  Her extensive 
experience before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has proven 
invaluable to the Office.  

Lara Leibman - Manager to Director:   Lara consistently has produced very 
high quality work across a number of industries and issues.  Most recently, 
she has developed both regulatory and technical knowledge on issues related 
to developing a secondary market for wireless spectrum.  This has enabled her 
to provide a valuable leadership role while working closely with her 
commercial counterparts in this and other areas.

Charles Yeung - Manger to Director:  Charles has been a key player in 
promoting changes to North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) 
operating policies that affect the East Trading Desk.  His understanding of 
the NERC policies and leadership role in NERC committees and working groups 
has been essential to successfully advocating meeting the needs of Enron.

Allison Navin -  Legislative Coordinator to Manager.  Allison has been 
responsible for the research and tracking of key issues and legislation in 
the Washington, DC office as well as coordinating briefing and informational 
materials and has done an outstanding job  in the execution of all of her 
resposibilities.  In her new role, Allison will be an integral member of the 
federal advocacy team, working on a number of legislative and regulatory 
issues that will include broadband and e-commerce.

Ginger Dernehl - Executive Secretary to Administrative Coordinator:   Ginger 
has done an outstanding job in supporting and coordinating efforts for the 
Government Affairs-The Americas group for the past 4 years.  Her dedication 
and hard work have resulted in her success and her promotion to 
Administrative Coordinator. A special personal note on Ginger. Ginger, in my 
mind, exemplifies and embodies the best of  Enron's vision and values: She 
works hard, produces outstanding results for the group, posesses an attitude 
that is optimistic and fun-loving, and still does an extraordinary job of 
balancing the personal and professional. Ginger, to put it succinctly, is a 
treasure and I am very pleased and proud to recognize her accomplishments.

Joseph Alamo - Administrative Assistant II to Sr. Administrative Assistant:  
Joseph has been with San Francisco office for 1 1/2  years, during which time 
he has supported as many as five members of the Government Affairs teams.  
Joseph is uniformly recognized for his willingness to take on difficult tasks 
and his dedication to the company's efforts.  We thank Joseph for his work on 
behalf of Government Affairs and congratulate him on his promotion. 

     Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals that have all 
made significant contributions to this company's success. I have also 
attached an updated organizational chart.

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

As we continue to address a number of issues facing Enron, it is critical that the company remain focused on attracting, motivating and retaining a diverse and talented workforce.  We strongly believe that our workforce is world-class -- the best in any industry, so we will continue to develop and reward this tremendous talent base.
 
Because the lasting strength of our company is determined by the strength of our workforce, we are elevating the role employee-focused functions play within Enron.  We are pleased to announce that effective immediately Human Resources, Employee Responsibility, and Executive and Corporate Compensation will report directly to the Office of the Chairman.
 
David Oxley, Vice President, will continue to oversee Enron's Global HR function.  The lead HR representatives for the individual business units will report to David in addition to their respective Office of the Chairman.  Besides managing Recruiting, Staffing, Training, Compensation and the Performance Evaluation Process, David will also add Payroll and Labor Relations to his list of responsibilities.
 
Cindy Olson, Executive Vice President, will have responsibility for Employee Relations and Corporate Responsibility, which includes Social Responsibility, Community Relations, Diversity, Employee Relations, Redeployment, Alumni Relations, Employee Events and Programs, Benefits, Wellness, and Worklife.
 
Mary Joyce, Vice President, will continue to have responsibility for Executive and Corporate Compensation in addition to Global Employee Information Management and Reporting and Analysis.

This is a great time to be at Enron. The challenges and opportunities at=20
Enron seem to be expanding with every passing day.  This presents enormous=
=20
challenges for Government Affairs as a group and for each of us=20
individually.  As we discussed at the staff meeting last month, this requir=
es=20
us to constantly reevaluate our priorities, our methods of getting things=
=20
done, and whether our organization is properly structured to meet the needs=
=20
of the entire company.  While we have done an outstanding job as a group=20
within our current structure, changes are necessary at this time.

The primary change in the organizational structure is to complete the=20
assignments for and reinforce the leadership roles of the individuals withi=
n=20
the group who have primary responsibility for setting the Government Affair=
s=20
strategy and agenda for the respective Enron operating companies.  The belo=
w=20
mentioned individuals will have the following responsibilities:

1. Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets:  Jim Steffes
2. The Enron Energy Services Group of Companies:  Harry Kingerski
3. Enron Broadband Services:  Sue Nord
4. Enron Global Markets and Enron Networks:  Lisa Yoho
5. Enron South America:  Jose Bestard
6. Federal Government Affairs:  Linda Robertson

With the impending retirement on March 31, 2001 of Joe Hillings, I am pleas=
ed=20
to announce that Linda Robertson will be joining the office on November 6,=
=20
2000, as a Vice President who will immediately assume responsibility for=20
leading the Federal Government Affairs group in our Washington office.  Lin=
da=20
was a Congressional staffer and partner/principal in two Washington law fir=
ms=20
prior to spending the last eight years with the U.S. Department of Treasury=
,=20
the last five as Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs and Public=20
Liaison, for Secretaries Rubin & Summers.  Linda brings a terrific=20
background, both in energy and financial services, and is a welcome additio=
n=20
to our team.  In order to more effectively integrate the Government Affairs=
=20
groups and strategy in Washington, the Federal Regulatory Affairs group und=
er=20
Joe Hartsoe=01,s direction will also report to Linda.  Joe Hartsoe will als=
o=20
retain primary responsibility for NERC activities, although Charles Yeung a=
nd=20
Dick Ingersoll will have a dotted line reporting relationship to Jim Steffe=
s=20
in his capacity of directing our activities for ENA.  Ray Alvarez will be=
=20
transferring from his current role with Transredes in Bolivia during the 1s=
t=20
quarter of 2001 and will join the Federal Regulatory Affairs group, reporti=
ng=20
to Joe Hartsoe.

On a personal note, I would like to acknowledge the significant contributio=
ns=20
that Joe Hillings has made to this company in his eighteen years of service=
. =20
Joe=01,s work ethic, intellect, and integrity have established Enron as a=
=20
company that is respected throughout Washington.  I will have more to say=
=20
about this as Joe=01,s retirement draws closer, but I look to him to be a v=
ital=20
part of the leadership transition in our Washington office that will occur=
=20
over the next days and weeks.

I will be relying heavily on the above-identified six individuals to ensure=
=20
that Government Affairs is firmly embedded within each of our operating=20
companies; that we as a group thoroughly understand their current business=
=20
strategies as well as new directions they may be taking in the future; and,=
=20
most importantly, to thoroughly understand how our organization can=20
contribute and add value to each of these companies on a continuing basis. =
=20
Communicating that understanding on a regular basis to the rest of the=20
Government Affairs organization and developing a Government Affairs wide=20
execution strategy will be a key objective for each of these individuals.

In order to ensure the success of these individuals and the Government=20
Affairs organization; the following changes are being made.

In addition to his leadership role with Government Affairs on behalf of the=
=20
EES group of companies, Harry Kingerski will continue to head up the=20
rates/regulatory group, now renamed Government Affairs Support Services.  =
=20
This group will continue to provide valuable technical support services=20
throughout Government Affairs and will be expanding its scope of expertise=
=20
over the next months to some of the new markets that the company has and wi=
ll=20
soon be entering.  Nancy Hetrick and Vinio Floris will join this organizati=
on=20
and report to Harry.
Jeff Brown, Tom Delaney, Mary Hain, Ron McNamara, Christi Nicolay, Thane=20
Twiggs, and Steve Walton will now report to Jim Steffes in his role=20
supporting Enron North America and Enron Industrial Markets. Alberto Levy=
=20
will be relocating from our Caracas, Venezuela office and will also report =
to=20
Jim.  A couple of special mentions:  Jeff Brown has done an outstanding job=
=20
in leading the CUBR (Coalition for Uniform Business Rules) process over the=
=20
last year and his current leadership of the Midwest ISO and Alliance RTO=20
efforts for Enron will be critical to the development of well functioning=
=20
wholesale electric markets in the U.S.  It is also my hope that Steve Walto=
n=20
will play an increased leadership role across North America on wholesale=20
electric market issues.  The incredible knowledge that Steve Walton possess=
es=20
of the electric industry, coupled with his industry-wide credibility, will=
=20
provide much needed support to our wholesale electric market reform efforts=
=20
across North America.
Tom Hoatson will now report to Steve Montovano in his new role in supportin=
g=20
the company=01,s efforts at PJM.  Tom will also continue to be an=20
organization-wide resource on technical issues regarding generation=20
interconnection and distributed generation.  Kathleen Sullivan has recently=
=20
joined Steve=01,s group from Azurix and will be primarily assisting Howard=
=20
Fromer in New York.
Sue Nord will head up the group that supports EBS.  Scott Bolton and Donald=
=20
Lassere, while reporting to Sue, will continue to provide leadership on=20
telecommunications issues.  Scott and Donald have done outstanding work and=
=20
will continue to be integral to our efforts in this area.
Finally, the Resource Commitment Review (RCR) process, beginning 1/1/01, wi=
ll=20
be extended to all of Government Affairs in North America, including Federa=
l=20
Government Affairs and Mexico.  The RCR Committee, beginning immediately,=

Roberston, Jim Steffes, Lisa Yoho & myself.

I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals 
have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale 
electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, 
resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool 
Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in 
the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional 
opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron 
Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the 
United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also 
played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in 
helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the 
delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned 
utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's 
competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced 
considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob 
has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial 
counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition 
last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value 
embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of 
both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity 
industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously 
during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that 
retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in 
California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging 
state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights 
tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in 
California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their 
significant accomplishments.

I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately.  Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe.

Rick:

Please find attached the first cut of the suggested structure.  Honestly, this was a surprisingly difficult task. 

The first cut, page one, is close to what is currently on the ground making the regions reporting to the head of the "Electricity & Gas".  The regions shall be divided-temporarily-into "wholesale" and "retail" by ISO regions.  This is because the skill set between "wholesale", and "retail" are different, and some time is required for them to converge (perhaps, 6 to 9 months) into one group.   


 
However, this suggestion does not address two concerns, namely,:
1.	How to bring Federal Government Affairs to focus on Electricity & Gas needs (mainly FERC).
2.	How to address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS.

The second suggestion, addresses the first point by dividing Federal Government Affairs into two sections.  One section-mainly political relationship management-remains as suggested in slide one, taking FERC Government Affairs and put it under "Energy Business".  This avoids "dotting reporting lines" phenomenon which-in my opinion- is less effective.  

 Of course, Energy Business can bring the suggested components into one block of skill pool very similar to a consultancy model.  In which case, the entire group, as in slide three, will be inside one box, possibly making the implementation easier among the whole group.  The components of the box (i.e., the skill set required), however, will be the same as in slide 2.  The consulting structure can also address the regional needs of Global Markets and EBS, which are not envisaged to be substantial.

I would like to discuss this further with you and take it from there. 
Kindly advise.

Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark=

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South=20

Enron is forming a new organization - - the Enron Xcelerator - - to drive the 
formation and development of new businesses at Enron.  Enron's unique ability 
to start and develop new businesses has driven most of our growth over the 
years.  Lou L. Pai, currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services, will 
lead the Xcelerator.  Over his years at Enron, Lou has been key to the 
creation and rapid growth of our wholesale gas, wholesale power and energy 
service businesses.  The existing business units will continue their 
development of core businesses, while the Xcelerator will be responsible for 
developing new business opportunities that are natural extensions of Enron's 
business model and core skills, but not currently under development elsewhere 
in Enron.

Dave Delainey, currently President and CEO of Enron Americas, will become 
Chairman and CEO of Enron Energy Services.  Dave brings a wealth of 
experience and accomplishment from Enron Wholesale Services' businesses where 
he led the growth of our Canadian business and our North American origination 
activity and, most recently, had a great year in Enron Americas.

Dave is forming an Office of the Chairman in EES.  Joining Dave in the Office 
of the Chairman are Dan Leff, President of EES, Global Energy Services, and 
Marty Sunde, President of EES, Global Marketing and Services.  Dan and Marty 
have been instrumental in the development and execution of the successful EES 
business model.  Also joining the Office of the Chairman of EES is Janet 
Dietrich as Chief Operating Officer.  Janet, currently is Managing Director 
in Enron Americas, where she has been successful in many of Enron Wholesale's 
core businesses, including gas trading, risk management and structural 
origination.  Tom White will continue as Vice Chairman of EES and will focus 
on the development and expansion of EES' customer relationships.  Lou, Tom, 
Dan, Marty and the entire EES organization have developed a great business 
model with great growth prospects.  EES has become an essential part of 
Enron's market valuation and growth story.  This new leadership structure 
will enable EES to continue on its path of sustained growth and increasing 
profitability.

John Lavorato will succeed Dave as President and CEO of Enron Americas.  John 
has been an essential part of Enron's energy trading success over the years 
and is a key part of Enron Wholesale Services' continuing success story.  
Joining John is Louise Kitchen, currently President and CEO of Enron 
NetWorks.  Louise, who accelerated Enron's outstanding growth with the 
deployment of EnronOnline, will take over as Chief Operating Officer of Enron 
Americas.

Philippe Bibi, currently Chief Operating Officer of Enron NetWorks will take 
over as President and CEO of Enron NetWorks.  Under Philippe's leadership, 
Enron has become a technology leader and the leading e-commerce company.  
Joining Philippe as Chief Operating Officer is Greg Piper, currently Managing 
Director of Enron NetWorks.  Greg currently leads Enron NetWork's origination 
activity and was responsible for the creation and deployment of ClickPaper, 
Enron's successful online pulp and paper marketplace.

Please join us in congratulating all of these individuals on their 
achievements and their new responsibilities.

Hello All-

I wanted to let you know that, as of July 1, Jan Haizmann's responsibilities 
will expand to include competition issues in European energy markets.  As you 
know, in addition to his work for EBS in Europe, Jan has been spending 
considerable time directing EBS' government affairs work in Asia.   Due in 
large part to the progress he has made, we are now able to shift that effort 
to an individual in the region until a new hire is on board in Singapore.  

Jan will continue to spend approximately half of his time on EBS government 
affairs issues in Europe.  The remainder of his time, which previously was 
spent on Asia, now will be spent on European energy markets.  

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Regards,

Sue

Subject: Changes at EBS

Date:  July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications=20
industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two year=
s=20
ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains=
=20
committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly=
=20
respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be=20
adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This=
=20
means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our=
=20
commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will=
=20
involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those=
=20
units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and cos=
ts=20
of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe =01) headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia =01) headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas =01) headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group=
,=20
led by Stewart Seeligson. =20
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul=
=20
Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk managemen=
t=20
perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the=
=20
Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to mo=
st=20
effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will b=
e=20
advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by=
=20
July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation,=20
redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not=
=20
yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor wil=
l=20
apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than=

We are making a number of significant organizational changes.  These change=
s=20
are intended to accomplish four key objectives:

First, we need to realign all our wholesale businesses around the successfu=
l=20
business model developed over the last decade in North America and Europe. =
=20
This model relies on extensive physical and transactional networks built=20
around a relatively small strategic asset position.

Second, we need to significantly streamline corporate reporting=20
relationships.  Particularly with Joe Sutton=01,s departure, the ability to=
=20
directly manage the day-to-day activities of 15 independent business units=
=20
has become increasingly difficult.

Third, we need to accomplish these changes without, in any way, compromisin=
g=20
the ongoing profitability of all our businesses and without delaying or=20
hindering our effort to monetize a significant portion of our lower-yieldin=
g=20
asset positions.

And fourth, as always, we need to take advantage of the reorganization to=
=20
redeploy our talent into our highest value opportunities.

ENRON WHOLESALE SERVICES

Today, we are forming Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) which will consolidate=
=20
our global wholesale businesses.  The closer alignment of our wholesale=20
businesses will accomplish the following: (1) enhanced communication and=20
coordination across business units, (2) more rapid deployment of people to=
=20
higher valued opportunities, (3) more effective prioritization of=20
opportunities across the wholesale business, and (4) more rapid extension o=
f=20
Enron=01,s wholesale business model and capabilities into new industries an=
d=20
markets.

Enron Wholesale Services will include our current North American, European=
=20
(including Japan and Australia), Global Markets, and Industrial Markets=20
operations, and will be expanded to include Enron=01,s Net Works business u=
nit=20
as well as a new unit =01) Enron Global Assets.  In addition, Enron=01,s me=
rchant=20
businesses outside of North America and Europe will be integrated into this=
=20
new structure as described below.

Mark Frevert, currently Chairman of each of our wholesale units, will assum=
e=20
the role of Chairman and CEO of Enron Wholesale Services.  Greg Whalley,=20
currently Chairman and CEO of Enron Net Works, will join Mark in the Office=
=20
of the Chairman as President and Chief Operating Officer.

Providing further impetus for these organizational changes, several of our=
=20
international business unit leaders have elected to move into new leadershi=
p=20
positions:

Rebecca McDonald, currently CEO of Enron APACHI, will join EWS as President=
=20
and CEO of Enron Global Assets. Enron Global Assets will have responsibilit=
y=20
for managing all of Enron=01,s existing energy asset portfolio outside of N=
orth=20
America and Europe.  Joining Rebecca in the Office of the Chairman as COO=
=20
will be Jim Hughes, currently COO of Enron APACHI.  Rebecca and Jim will=20
report to the EWS Office of the Chairman.

Sanjay Bhatnagar, currently CEO of Enron India, has joined EBS as CEO for t=
he=20
Middle East and Asia region.  Sanjay will be responsible for building our=
=20
broadband business in this region and the current EBS team in this region=
=20
will report to Sanjay.  In this role, Sanjay will report to the EBS office =
of=20
the Chairman.  In addition, Sanjay will continue to remain responsible for=
=20
Enron=01,s wholesale energy business in India and will transition this busi=
ness=20
into Enron Global Assets in the near future.
=20
Diomedes Christodoulou, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, has joined=
=20
EBS as Chief Commercial Officer.  Diomedes will be located in London and wi=
ll=20
focus his origination activities on global opportunities, with near term=20
attention to the wholesale and enterprise sectors.  Diomedes will report to=
=20
the EBS Office of the Chairman.

Jim Bannantine, currently Co-CEO of Enron South America, will be joining EE=
S=20
to lead EES=01, commercial efforts outside North America and Europe.  In or=
der=20
to ensure a smooth transition for our South American businesses and to=20
facilitate our asset sales activities, Jim will remain in South America for=
=20
at least the next several months and continue to serve as CEO of Enron Sout=
h=20
America.  Throughout the transition, Jim will report to Cliff Baxter and to=
=20
the Office of the Chairman of Enron Wholesale Services.  Following the=20
transition, Jim will join EES.

In addition to these changes in our international asset operations=20
activities, we are making the following changes in our merchant wholesale=
=20
businesses and the commercial support functions:

Enron Net Works
Louise Kitchen will assume Greg=01,s previous responsibilities as President=
 and=20
CEO of Enron Net Works, reporting into Mark and Greg. =20

Enron Americas
Concurrent with the transfer to Enron Global Assets of responsibility for=
=20
operating Enron=01,s South and Central America asset base, all trading,=20
marketing, and new asset development activities in these regions will repor=
t=20
into a new entity, Enron Americas.  Enron Americas will have responsibility=
=20
for all wholesale merchant businesses across North, Central and South=20
America.  Dave Delainey, President and CEO, and John Lavorato, Chief=20
Operating Officer will comprise the Office of the Chairman for Enron=20
Americas.

Enron Europe
The Enron Europe organization, which includes Enron=01,s businesses in Aust=

Sherriff, President and CEO, and Michael Brown, Chief Operating Officer.

Enron Global Markets
Enron Global Markets, under the leadership of Mike McConnell, President and=

Commercial Support for EWS
The commercial support functions for EWS will remain with, and be managed b=

To this end we have asked several people to take on an expanded role across=

newly defined roles are as follows:

Mid and Back Office Operations =01) Sally Beck will lead Mid and Back Offic=

with Sally reporting to Louise Kitchen and Rick Causey, Executive Vice=20
President and Chief Accounting Officer.  This alignment creates a coordinat=

wholesale businesses and to maximize opportunities to commercialize these=

services.  Mid and Back Office services for all commercial activities will=

continue to be organized with dedicated operations controllers responsible=

for specific commodities and/or geographic locations.
Legal =01) Mark Haedicke will serve in the role of General Counsel for EWS.
Regulatory and Government Affairs =01) This function will remain organized =
on a=20
regional basis.  Rick Shapiro will support all EWS businesses operating in=

the Americas, and Mark Schroeder, who is based in London, will support all=

and will continue to report to Steve Kean, Executive Vice President and Chi=

of Staff.
Public Relations =01) This function is also organized primarily on a region=

basis.  Eric Thode will have responsibility for North American activity,=20
Enron Net Works, and Enron Industrial Markets.  Jackie Gentle will continue=

in her role for Enron Europe (including Japan and Australia) and John Amble=

 In light of the increased leadership opportunities created by Enron=01,s=

I am pleased to announce that effective July 1st the following individuals have been promoted from Director to Senior Director.  

Dan Allegretti - Dan has been a leader on both retail and wholesale electricity issues in New England for the past several years with Enron, resulting in Dan currently serving as Chair of the New England Power Pool Participants Committee.  Dan, more importantly, has been very active, both in the past and during the course of this year, in ensuring that transactional opportunities in the New England region are fully exploited by both Enron Wholesale Services and Enron Energy Services.  Dan's participation in the United Illuminating deal has been mentioned many times, but Dan has also played a critical role in working with Enron Energy Services this year in helping to develop a national business plan for creating value through the delivery of retail services in partnership with municipal and privately owned utilities.

Robert Hemstock - Rob's participation in the development of Alberta's competitive electricity market and the ensuing PPA project, that has produced considerable value for Enron and Enron Canada has been quite notable.  Rob has been a leader, not only with policy makers, but also with his commercial counterparts in ensuring that the PPA transaction was brought to fruition last year.  Rob has also played a critical role in preserving the value embedded in that deal throughout the course of this year.  Rob's knowledge of both wholesale and retail issues in both the natural gas and electricity industries in Western Canada is unparalleled.  

Sue Mara - Sue is a warrior.  Sue has fought endlessly and courageously during her years with Enron in trying to ensure, against all odds, that retail and wholesale electricity markets work as effectively as possible in California while also protecting Enron's interests in that very challenging state.  Sue is a passionate believer in the efficacy of markets, and fights tirelessly for both the issues as well as the well-being of the company in California.

Please join me in congratulating each of these individuals on their significant accomplishments.

>From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

From: =09Dernehl, Ginger   On Behalf Of Shapiro, Richard
Sent:=09Tuesday, August 07, 2001 9:28 AM
To:=09Sherriff, John; Brown, Michael - COO London
Cc:=09Lewis, Richard; Shaw, Eric
Subject:=09Enron Europe Government Affairs Group



On my last visit to London, I met with John Sherriff & Richard Lewis separa=
tely and discussed the possibility of naming a team leader within the Enron=
 Europe Government Affairs group.  The purpose of naming a team leader woul=
d be to provide more consistent leadership for the group on a day-to-day ba=
sis, principally on personnel issues, but also to ensure that a consistent =
policy approach is being taken across the Government Affairs group on issue=
s that affect the company.  I know that John is ambivalent about naming suc=
h a team leader, but I thought that I would make the case once again, and, =
hopefully in a more compelling manner so we can move forward with this idea=
.

First, it is important to say what the designation of a team leader would n=
ot do.  It would not, in my estimation, change the nature of the reporting =
relationships that we currently have relative to Eric Shaw, Richard Lewis a=
nd myself.  Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will continue to report to Eri=
c Shaw and myself, and Paul Dawson and Doug Wood would continue to report t=
o Richard Lewis and myself.   Second, as the unchanged nature of the report=
ing relationships indicate, this change is in no way intended to diminish t=
he role of Eric and/or Richard relative to the management of the Government=
 Affairs group, but merely to ensure that someone is tending to personnel, =
administrative and group management issues on a daily basis.  Third, by nam=
ing a team leader within the Government Affairs group, I am not attempting,=
 in any way, to step back from the role that I personally have taken on rel=
ative to the group - I will continue to provide strategic guidance (where I=
 can) and also will continue to ensure that the Enron Europe Government Aff=
airs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs functio=
n so that the Europe group is the beneficiary of knowledge and information =
that is developed around the world within the government affairs function.

The intent of designating a team leader, as already stated, is merely to en=
sure that issues related to the administration of the group, consistency of=
 external advocacy, and personnel issues are handled on a timely and effect=
ive basis.  While I believe there have been many benefits from the current =
organizational structure, one of the significant and increasingly more noti=
ceable negatives has been that there has not always been a consistent and f=
air approach to the handling of personnel issues within the group (notwiths=
tanding my best efforts to deal with these issues from a distance).  This h=
as resulted in, what I consider to be, the sub-optimal handling of at least=
 one employee who is in the process of being terminated, as well as inconsi=
stent messaging to many of the junior people within the group in terms of w=
hat their career opportunities are within the larger government affairs fun=
ction in Europe (which, in turn, has created issues of morale).  These issu=
es, in my mind, are of sufficient concern that, if left unaddressed, the gr=
oup's ability to sustain a record of providing excellent support throughout=
 the organization may, in time, be in jeopardy.  I am confident that, by na=
ming a team leader, we will retain virtually all of the benefits of the col=
lective leadership approach that are embodied in the current structure, chi=
ef among them,  greater participation from both Eric and Richard on an ongo=
ing basis.  What we will gain, however, by the designation of a team leader=
, is increased and sustained attention to the issues that I have already me=
ntioned. =20

The person that I believe is best suited for this team leadership role is P=
aul Dawson. =20
My observations, relative to Paul, are that he understands the needs of the=
 individuals within the group and will do everything that he can to ensure =
that personnel issues are handled in a fair and expeditious manner.  In add=
ition, Paul has a very sound grasp of many, if not all, of the issues facin=
g Enron Europe and will provide, I believe, consistent leadership on substa=
nce as well as on personnel and administrative issues.  It is also my expec=
tation that Doug Wood, who has assumed many of the administrative responsib=
ilities, e.g., budget, will continue to assist Paul in that capacity and th=
at both Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer will also continue to participate =
in a leadership role along with Paul Dawson and Doug.

I believe that this is the right approach to take and it is my hope that on=
 my next trip to London, in mid September, that I would be able to sit down=
 with Paul Dawson, Paul Hennemeyer, Peter Styles and Doug Wood with any com=
bination of yourselves, and lay out the modest organizational change embodi=
ed within this memorandum.  If you have any questions, please feel free to =
contact me.

Thanks

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

These replace the documents Karen sent.  Last minute changes, as is expected.  We will probably make Ken Lay available for key interviews.  Let me know if anybody has any thoughts.

Alex:  Please keep confidential until we cross this at 7:00 AM Houston time.

Thanks to all,

A follow-on to Janel's comments: I wanted to comment a bit on the " Califor=
nia campaign", our group's(internal and external) individual and collective=
 efforts, and the work that continues: While I may be properly, and not sur=
prisingly, characterized as "non-practicing"(in a formal religious sense), =
I do believe quite firmly that what we do in life( and how we do it) echoes=
 through eternity...it is the effort and the quality of the effort in all t=
hat we do in our lives that both matters and echoes...While we engage in wo=
rk that cannot be equated with the work of people, past and present, such a=
s Mother Teresa, the work we do is good, very good in fact, and makes a sig=
nificant difference to the 18,000 Enron employees and their families...Each=
 of you, in the context of the broad "campaign" to communicate the rightnes=
s of our perspective and to protect the good name of the company and indivi=
duals within the company, has put forth a great effort that has been perfor=
med with excellence and that has made a significant and positive difference=
....and that has succeeded in many respects thus far....I understand the ef=
fort continues, but each of you should feel very proud now.... about what w=
e have done and how we have done it. Thanks very much.

With the continued growth of some of the more non-traditional businesses at 
Enron; e.g., broadband, agricultural commodities, steel, etc..., it has 
become apparent that additional support from Government Affairs, of these and 
other non-traditional businesses, is necessary.  To that end, I've asked 
Harry Kingerski to focus his time and efforts more fully on developing his 
support group's (Government Affairs Support Services) capabilities, with an 
objective of broadening their support beyond EES and ENA.  With the void that 
Harry leaves in formally directing our group's efforts on behalf of EES, I've 
asked Jim Steffes to assume a leadership role with respect to EES as well as 
ENA. I've also asked Lisa Yoho to assume responsibility for Enron Industrial 
Markets in addition to her responsibility for Enron Global Markets and Enron 
Networks.  No further organizational changes are being made at this time but, 
as always, organizational flexibility in how our group responds to the needs 
of the business units will be the order of the day.  I am confident that all 
of us will support Harry, Lisa and Jim with their additional 
responsibilities. Thank you.

DealBench

Enron Net Works' newest initiative is now online!  

The Product
DealBenchTM is an online platform that enables licensing companies to arrange 
and execute transactions  efficiently and effectively.  Companies that 
license DealBenchTM are able to organize their transaction materials, upload 
documents and other materials to a secure website, invite deal participants 
to view deal materials, host various types of online auctions and manage, 
track and close a transaction online.  
DealBenchTM incorporates five specific business tools that streamline the 
transaction process for licensees:
Document Sharing:   deal-related materials in various formats (Word, 
Powerpoint, Excel, CAD drawings, digital pictures,      etc.) can be uploaded 
for deal participants to view and/or edit.

Auctioning/Bidding:   licensees can design and monitor (in real-time) forward 
or reverse auctions and collect sealed tender      bids.

Multi-media:    customers can present high quality virtual road shows and 
asset descriptions using streaming video.

Secure Communication:  DealLineTM messaging system facilitates one-to-one, 
one-to-many, and many-to-many        communication.

Deal Management:   DealNotesTM  enables customers to monitor the progress of 
their deals using statistics on user      downloads, bidding/auction results 
and user page views.


Applications
DealBenchTM has been used by Enron during bank product syndications, the sale 
of a large portfolio of leases, and the procurement of certain materials for 
the new headquarters building.   Soon, DealBenchTM will also meet the 
collaboration needs of Enron attorneys, facilitate online RFQs and provide 
for the hosting of online datarooms.  

To learn more about DealBenchTM, please join eSpeak on Wednesday October 4th 
when Harry Arora (Vice-President, eCommerce) will answer questions regarding 
this Enron Net Works initiative.  For additional information, please visit 
https://www.DealBench.com (username= guest, password= dealbench) or email 
webmaster@DealBench.com.
NOTE:  If you are unable to execute the above link, please copy the link into 
the address line of your installed browser.

We welcome all thoughts and ideas on how the DealBench platform can be 
utilized to address the needs of Enron's business units.  Further, as the 
platform is available to be licensed externally, please forward new business 
development leads to members of the    DealBenchTM team.

Rick:

Please find attached the presentation on the Technical International Regulatory Support.  I hope that you agree with its style of "less is more"; of course I can change it very quickly if needed.   

As you can see from the email below, Guillermo has already started the process in Brazil; it seems to be a popular idea with Sergio.

Please let me know if you have any question.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John

Rick - here goes for a draft announcement.  I've written it as coming from Michael, but it should be easily amended if the sender differs.

"I am pleased to announce some organisational changes to the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group.  Paul Dawson will become head of the group taking responsibility for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responibilities.   Paul will report directly to myself and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood (Continental Gas), Peter Styles (EU and Continental Power) and Paul Hennemeyer (German speaking countries).  Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group with Rick Shapiro continuing to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe

etc

Michael Brown"

Hope this is OK for a general announcement - not sure there is much more to say to the wider audience without dwelling on justifications and the finer points of how the respective responsibilities will pan out.  Clearly, however, a bit more explanation will be required for some individuals and the team as a whole.

Let know if you manage to get hold of Michael, re, my telling Doug.  If possible, I'd like to be able to discuss this with him sooner rather than later.

Paul

Thanks to all of you, Enron North America has had an outstanding year in=20
2000.  Some of the more notable accomplishments include:
a) 100% plus increase in EBIT from 1999 actuals to 2000 forecast;
b) significant rationalization of the balance sheet including the sale of t=
he=20
(i) Wind River/Powder River gathering assets, (ii) East Coast Power=20
generating assets, (iii) HPL and (iv) five of the six Eastern Peakers;
c) ENA is the leading energy merchant by a factor of two;
d) physical electricity volume grew by 34% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
e) natural gas volumes grew by 82% YTD 1999 to YTD 2000 forecast;
f) 500% growth in daily transactions from November 1999 to November 2000 du=
e=20
to the highly successful Enron OnLine distribution channel; and
g) ENA reaching its 25% ROCE target.

These are truly outstanding accomplishments and our expectations for growth=

and opportunity in Enron North America for 2001 are consistent with that=20
success.  In order to reach these goals, we felt it necessary to re-align a=
=20
number of our organizations. A number of these changes are completed.  The=
=20
goals of such re-alignment include:
a) increase overall productivity with the goal to ensure that every employe=
e=20
is in a position to contribute regardless of skill set;
b) increase overall market coverage, deal flow and information generation=
=20
with the goal to increase bid/offer income, increase the velocity of deal=
=20
flow, improve customer coverage and promote quality information transfer to=
=20
our trading organization;
c) increase deal quality and earnings quality with the goal to (i) allocate=
=20
our resources towards the best transactions and (ii) significantly increase=
=20
our =01&mid-market=018 originated transactions in our portfolio;
d) promote real time decision making and a closer tie between our trading a=
nd=20
origination (mid-market and structured) organizations in order to better=20
align those functions to reduce the amount of un-productive internal focus;
e) increase the overall velocity of the capital being utilized consistent=
=20
with our goal of a 25% plus return on capital employed; and
f) identify and recognize a host of new leaders in the organization that ar=
e=20
critical to meeting our goals next year.

With these objectives in mind, patterned after the successful business mode=
ls=20
in Calgary and Portland, effective immediately the following changes are=20
being implemented:
a) East Power =01) a single East Power Team incorporating trading, mid-mark=

I forgot to forward this to you yesterday--sorry!  


Success on many of our issues depends on the interplay of multiple political and regulatory institutions at both the federal and state levels.  Building on the success of our closely coordinated efforts in the California campaign, I am formalizing a new issue strategy group.  The purpose of the issue strategy group is (1) to work with individuals across government affairs to develop issue strategies that fully integrate our efforts in a variety of arenas;and (2) to assist with the implementation of those strategies.

As per our discussion this morning, please find attached the general description for Risk Analytics & Fundamentals Group.  


I welcome any question and/or suggestion.  

Best regards

AI
3-3037

Risk Analytics & Fundamentals Group

This Group has three largely inter-related functions.  They are:   
1)	Risk Analytics:
The primary purpose of this new group is to provide workable, tested, and cost-effective processes to identify, quantify, mitigate, and/or manage regulatory risks embedded in Enron's businesses.  The immediate objectives of the group are: 
i)	Establish, test, and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory Risks in URM in North America.  
ii)	 Establish, test, and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory Risks in the relevant activities for EWS in North America.  Extend the system to Europe.
iii)	Provide, test and implement methodologies for identifying, quantifying, and mitigating/management of the regulatory risks in the three most important commodities in EGM, and EIM (Coal, Steel, and Forest Products).  Extend the system to Europe, if applicable.

Finally, the Group should periodically aggregate the risk findings in the different business units in a single report for communication and resource allocation purposes by GA Management.   

2)	Fundamentals: 
The secondary purpose of the group is to initiate the Regulatory Fundamentals Section.  Its purpose is to provide analyzed regulatory information to commercial/regulatory data that should enhance the range of the products and services that GA is providing to the different commercial teams.  Examples of such regulatory/commercial data include interstate electricity sales and prices, availability of transmission capacity on different interties, demand and supply analysis on the appropriate customer level,?etc.  

The Fundamentals section should also work as a powerhouse for GA Support Services (GASS) to provide in-depth analysis of regulatory problems/issues.  It should assist GASS in providing consulting services to the different commercial teams in issues related to risk measurements and mitigations.  

The immediate objective of this activity is:
i)	Establish, test, and run systems for regulatory fundamentals in EWS (Gas and Electric).

3)	International Regulatory Support:
The third purpose of the group is to provide Regulatory Support to Enron's Assets, and commercial positions, in Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, and India on ad-hoc basis to identify the operational regulatory risks.

Rick - 

Attached is a Resources Spreadsheet for our meeting tomorrow afternoon.  The 
spreadsheet is broken out by Cost Center and lists employee name, project the 
employee is working on, and the business unit affected (if known).  There is 
also a column for prob. of success that I thought would be filled out at the 
meeting.  The information on this spreadsheet is taken from the monthly 
reports (that I have worked on or have received) and the old IRTF report 
submitted.  I also spoke to Ricardo who gave me his projects.  I've worked 
with Jim Steffes, Sue Nord, and Lisa Yoho on the preparation of their monthly 
reports.  I know that Jim's report went out yesterday but I haven't seen the 
final version.  You should receive the final report for Sue and Lisa this 
week.  Please advise if the information on the attached spreadsheet meets our 
needs for tomorrow.  I can make changes in the morning.  I've got to work on 
Lisa's report in the morning and finalize the presentation for Friday.  I 
think Lisa left you a voice mail about the training program.  The slides are 
done for the presentation and I need to write what I'm going to say.  I think 
that's it for now.  Sorry if this rambles.

	EBS Office of the Chairman Sent by: EBS Announcements 07/12/01 11:10 AM 	   To: EBS Worldwide  cc:   Subject: Changes at EBS	



To:		All EBS Employees Worldwide

From:		EBS Office of the Chairman

Subject:	Changes at EBS

Date:		July 12, 2001

Since its inception, EBS has seen dramatic changes in the communications industry.  The growth and opportunity anticipated in this industry two years ago has significantly changed in the past nine months.  While Enron remains committed to extending our business model into telecom, we need to quickly respond to these changes in the market to achieve our objectives.

The Enron Corp. earnings release issued today states that we will be adjusting the EBS business to better match the revenue opportunities.  This means that we must reduce our overall cost structure and better focus our commercial efforts.

To achieve this, we will take the following steps:

EBS will become a business unit within Enron Wholesale Services.  This will involve the integration of all EBS commercial support functions into those units within EWS, and will enable us to better manage the resources and costs of the support functions.

All EBS commercial functions will be consolidated into the following units:

Europe - headed by Matthew Scrimshaw
Asia - headed by Anthony Duenner
Americas - headed by Rich DiMichele
We will consolidate the North American EBS origination teams into one group, led by Stewart Seeligson.  
North American trading and risk management will continue to report to Paul Racicot.  Paul will also oversee the global portfolio from a risk management perspective.

Global Network Operations will continue to report to the EBS Office of the Chairman.

All EBS asset positions will continue to be reviewed and repositioned to most effectively meet the future needs of EBS.

The Portland office will be closed by October 1.  Portland employees will be advised by their supervisors of their relocation or redeployment status by July 27.

These changes will affect many EBS employees through relocation, redeployment, severance or movement to another part of Enron.  We have not yet worked out all of the details of these changes, but your supervisor will apprise you of how this affects you as soon as possible, and no later than July 27.

To:	ECT Europe@ENRON <mailto:Europe@ENRON>; Enron Metals in NY@ENRON <mailto:NY@ENRON>
Subject:	Organisational Announcement


I am pleased to announce an organisational change within the European Government and Regulatory Affairs Group that will become effective immediately. Paul Dawson will assume a leadership role for government and regulatory affairs across continental Europe in addition to his current UK responsibilities. Paul will report directly to me and Rick Shapiro and will be strongly supported by the other senior members of the team: Doug Wood, Peter Styles and Paul Hennemeyer. Richard Lewis and Eric Shaw will continue to work closely with the group along with Rick Shapiro who will continue to provide the team with strategic guidance to ensure that the European Government Affairs group is fully integrated within the global government affairs function.

I believe these changes will enable us to maintain Enron's leadership in regulatory efforts to broaden the markets available to us, to capitalise on regulatory changes and to continue the group's major contribution to our commercial success in the UK and Continental Europe.


Michael Brown

Subject:	Organisational Announcement


Enron has had a very good year to date and we at Enron Europe have played our part in this.   However, if we are to maintain growth levels, we need to focus very closely on our cost base and create more efficiencies in the current round of Enron Corp. budget reviews.

We are analysing much more closely exactly which businesses we derive our earnings from and concentrating our resources on those areas.  We will be taking decisions to put some projects on the "back burner"and reduce the scope of others.

This will inevitably mean that we need to reduce our headcount both in commercial and commercial support groups as we seek to identify the best mix of skills to keep us on our earnings growth track.  To this end we will be seeking to cut our headcount in Europe by between five and ten percent, but we will aim as far as possible to achieve this through a program of voluntary severance.  Details of this program will be made available by Monday 8th October.  We hope to complete this exercise and communicate the outcome as quickly as possible in October so that everyone knows where they stand.

Please feel free to contact either of us, but also talk to your supervisor about any specific concerns you may have and remember that you can also make use of the LifeWorks confidential counselling service that is available on 0800 169 1920.

We firmly believe that if we work hard together now to achieve these short term goals, we will create a stronger, more flexible team at Enron which will be better placed than ever to grow our business in Europe.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

Subject: Gov & Reg Affairs organisation and space

We propose not to proceed with the 30 min. meeting reserved in your diaries 
(11:30-12:00 Tuesday 1 May) to discuss the G&RA  organisation and desk space 
requirement.   We attach all information below ; if you're agreeable we'll go 
ahead on this basis.  If you still wish to meet, please let us know.

Paul, Paul, Peter & Doug


Govt & Reg Affairs organisation



Charts are attached.  Changes have been made as follows:

1. France and Belgium (Bruno Gaillard + 0.5 * Research Assistant) now join 
Netherlands under Peter Styles to capitalise on previous PS involvement in 
those countries.
2. Brussels-based continental gas resource Brendan Devlin (who may now not 
join) has been split in 2 : one London-based resource under Doug Wood working 
on continental gas and one Brussels-based resource under Peter Styles as 
second base on EU.
3. Andreas Wagner (Enron Wind) affiliated with Paul Hennemeyer pro tem. 
because of linkage on German environmental issues.
4. Jan Haizmann (currently EBS regulatory) may become freed up from Far 
Eastern broadband to assist on German and EU competition issues.
5. Correction of minor errors : Frankfurt manager, assistants, other 
appointments in the pipeline omitted in previous version.

Space allocation

Professional staff will integrate with commercial teams in a combination of 
permanent desks / hot desks.  The immediate requirement is for 6 desks in 
Richard's area and 5 in Eric's.  This will increase as G&R Affairs vacancies 
are filled.  We'll provide detail to relevant assistants.

To free up maximum number of desks on 1st floor, some space could be reserved 
on 5th floor next to PR for other G&RA requirements (assistants, govt affairs 
library, extensive paper files, hot desks at peak times / "quiet desks" for 
reviewing legislation, licences etc).  This can be reduced over time to the 
extent library can be digitized and assistants found space among commercial 
groups.  Alternatively, if space pressures on 1st floor are increasing, G&RA 
staff can regroup on 5th floor and free up desks on 1st for commercial staff, 
as before.  Precise requirements will be worked out with Toby Knight.

In a recent organizational memo, I mentioned what a great time this is to b=
e=20
at Enron.  I believe that more strongly than ever, given the new markets we=
=20
are entering, the enhanced focus of the company on markets and regions arou=
nd=20
the world that best fit with our core competencies, and the phenomenal grow=
th=20
of the company, perhaps best evidenced by the earnings report of the first=
=20
quarter.  But, there are challenges as well: California, and its regional a=
nd=20
global implications, and the general market conditions that have brought ou=
r=20
stock price well off its recent highs.  With respect to each of these and=
=20
other challenges, there are invariably opportunities: for example, the=20
enhanced opportunity for the FERC to finish the job of opening wholesale=20
electricity markets in the context of California; and, in the context of a=
=20
lower stock price, a recognition that accelerated growth in earnings will=
=20
bring the stock price to new highs in the not too distant future.  One way=
=20
that earnings can grow beyond Wall Street expectations is by bringing a bit=
=20
more discipline to how all of us spend money at Enron.  We in Government=20
Affairs can point to many efforts and processes that have been designed to=
=20
instill that spending and resource allocation discipline in the last few=20
years.  We have always done our part, but there is always more that can be=
=20
done.

To increase earnings and, correspondingly, the stock price, I recently met=
=20
with various Government Affairs group heads to discuss ways Government=20
Affairs can do things better and more cost effectively.  We looked at group=
=20
travel costs, outside services, and other budget items.  Attached for your=
=20
review and use is a copy of a new Travel Policy and new Cell Phone Policy,=
=20
which I believe, will ensure consistency across the group and deliver cost=
=20
savings.  Such travel policies already exist in various regions such as Enr=
on=20
Europe. (Regional Business Unit travel policies will continue to be applied=
,=20
where applicable)

Further, as a result of our review of the budget, we have identified saving=
s=20
across the North American group in excess of 1.5 million dollars (USD).  Th=
is=20
is in addition to almost 2 million dollars (USD) by which the Enron Europe=
=20
Government Affairs budget has been reduced, as well as significant reductio=
ns=20
that have occurred in the South American group. Finally, I have also decide=
d=20
to create a global government affairs hiring committee, which will evaluate=
=20
the need for any proposed hires (new and existing positions).  The purpose =
of=20
the committee will be to assess whether the need is valid and, assuming it=
=20
is, determine the most effective way to fill the position.  By encompassing=
 a=20
cross-section of the Government Affairs group globally, it is my hope that =
we=20
will arrive at better hiring decisions.  The hiring committee will consist =
of=20
Aleck Dadson (Toronto), Sue Nord (Houston), Jim Steffes (Houston), Paul=20
Dawson (London), Doug Wood (London), Nick O=01,Day (Tokyo), Sergio Assad (S=
ao=20
Paulo), Linda Robertson (Washington) and myself.   The committee will meet =
on=20
an as needed basis.

I believe that these changes will allow us all the opportunity to provide=
=20
more cost effective and efficient service to the business units we support.=
 =20
I encourage each of you to review the new policies and provide feedback.=20

Thank you

Nick, just confirming our discussion re Rob. As you would be aware Rob 
reports to Paul and myself. This reflected the fact that his role whilst 
primarily Regulatory Affairs  also has a legal component.  

Mark Schroeder was his functional report and also his conduit into the 
Regulatory Affairs PRC process. Both Paul and myself would welcome you taking 
over this role. As discussed,   I believe Rob would benefit from your 
suggestion of a regular phone discussion at weekly or two-weekly intervals. 
These sessions could provide some useful Regulatory Affairs mentoring.  This 
would supplement what we are doing to encourage Rob to both be more 
pro-active on commercial issues and also promote his  career development with 
in Regulatory Affairs. On the PRC process we will continue to do Rob's 
appraisal here and pass through assessments for you to represent Rob in 
within the Reg. Affairs.         

Again Nick we appreciate your taking on this role. 

David Minns

FYI.  It looks like we can move ahead with Karen in a temporary assignment,=
 without her losing anything in the transition package offered by EBS.  How=
ever ... it may be more difficult to move her to the analyst position than =
we thought.  She is listed in peoplefinder as a senior admin., but she is a=
ctually a number of pay levels below that ... .

Subject: Draft Organizational Announcement about Japan


May I please have your comments if any on this draft by close of business 
Wednesday.  We hope to have agreed on the Q&A's by then and to send it out 
the announcement on Thursday.

John

To be sent to:  All Enron Europe, all employees in Japan,  all Global Markets 
and all VPs and up around the company

Enron has established several wholesale businesses in Japan in the last year 
including Metals,  Power Plant Development (via our investment in EnCom),  
Coal,  LNG & Weather.   We see significant opportunities in each of these 
businesses and we will continue to expand our presence in Japan in order to 
capture these opportunities.  However, while Japan continues to make progress 
towards a liberalized electricity market, significant barriers to power 
trading remain under the current interim market structure.  Until further 
tangible steps are taken to improve third party access for electricity in 
Japan, we will suspend our power marketing efforts and focus on the 
significant opportunities that currently exist in our other wholesale 
businesses. [Any statement regarding our existing power sales commitment?]  
Once the necessary regulatory changes have been completed we expect to 
aggressively pursue Enron's traditional position as the leading buyer and 
seller of electricity in every deregulated market.  

We are making a number of organization changes in order to better align our 
resources with the opportunities in the Japanese market.  [deleted text] Joe 
Hirl our President of Enron Japan will move to the Global Markets group and 
lead a team that will focus on developing all our Global Markets 
opportunities in Japan especially Weather,  Oil,  LNG,  Coal, and 
Shipping.    We expect to continue our general recruiting  of Japanese 
nationals and as President of Enron Japan,  Joe will continue to provide the 
overall business leadership to both recruiting and the Analyst and Associate 
program in Japan.  The Finance origination team headed by Jeremy Thirsk will 
continue to report to Joe and also move to Global Markets.  Our power trading 
group led by Morton Erik Pettersen will transition into other roles around 
Enron.  The Equity/FX/Interest rate team which is a part of Global Markets 
has two employees in the Tokyo office today and they expect to expand their 
efforts throughout the year.

The EnCom group, which is our power plant development business (with minority 
partners) and headed by Carey Sloan will continue its efforts in developing 
power plants in Japan.  We are pleased with the progress we are making on a 
number of sites and EnCom will continue to report to the Enron Europe Office 
of the Chairman.

Our Metals team headed by Kazunari Sugimoto will continue to report through 
Enron Metals in London.

By May we expect Enron Credit to have two to three employees in Tokyo pursing 
the Credit Derivative business.  These employees remain in  Enron Credit , a 
part of Enron Europe.

EBS has two employees headed by Jim Weisser and this team expects to expand  
by year end.

The Industrial Markets team also expects to have two employees in the Tokyo 
office in the next couple of months.

In the last seven months the commercial support services for Japan have been 
transitioned to London for support and this is not changing.  Jane McBride 
heads the legal team and will continue to functionally report  to Mark Evans, 
General Counsel in London.   The RAC function will continue to report to Ted 
Murphy, head of RAC for Enron Europe.   The Risk Management and Accounting 
team is headed by Jan-Erland Bekeng will continue to functionally report to 
Fernley Dyson in London.  The  IT, HR,  Tax and real estate teams will also 
continue to functionally report to London. 

Nick O'Day who heads the Public Affairs group (Government & Regulatory 
Affairs and the Public Relations) in Japan will report to the Enron Europe 
Office of the Chair with a Public Relations functional reporting to Jackie 
Gentle in London and a Government Affairs functional reporting to Rick 
Shapiro in Houston.   We anticipate that his team's efforts will be primarily 
directed to supporting the EnCom power plant development team but they will 
also continue to provide support for Global Markets, EBS & Industrial Markets.

We have already made considerable progress in breaking into the Japanese 
markets across a wide range of Enron businesses and we anticipate that this 
will provide significant profit growth for years to come. Through these 
current changes we can demonstrate our ability to be flexible and target our 
resources where they will realise the most immediate value for the company.
