Subject: MG Middle Office Integration : Weekly Newsletter

Hi,

Welcome to the first of a series of weekly MG bulletins informing you of=20
progress with the integration.

So, what=01,s happening?

1) Status of Acquisition :

two days ago Enron reached a key threshold of 90% acceptances for our=20
previously announced "conditional" cash offer.

under take-over rules, this means that we can now nominate the date from=20
which our offer goes "unconditional" and from which we will have "effective=
=20
control" - for legal, tax and treasury reasons that date will probably be=
=20
sometime during the week 17th-21st July.

the "effective control" date should not be confused with the date from whic=
h=20
MG plc results will be "consolidated" with those of Enron Europe - for=20
practical reasons we actually have some discretion which date we chose to=
=20
consolidate from, within the range 1st July to 1st August.

various groups of Enron personnel are engaged in the integration effort and=
=20
Richard Sage is co-ordinating on behalf of Fernley Dyson - the reason I am=
=20
sending out this bulletin is that Mike has asked me to co-ordinate the=20
integration of the Middle Office!


2) This Week

EnronOnline initiative - coincidently, at around the same time that Enron=
=20
launched EOL, MG launched their own internet trading platform for base meta=
l=20
products. There has been a lot of discussion about how we move MG's interne=
t=20
based business over to EnronOnline in order to be able to offer our=20
burgeoning EOL client base a fuller range of products. However, as a first=
=20
step this week we launched three new base metals products, not previously=
=20
traded by MG, on EnronOnline and so on Monday we did our first base metals=
=20
trades!=20

using the "Doorstep" format, Brent Price is leading a controls review to he=
lp=20
us assess operational risks, and generally focus on the areas that we need =
to=20
think about as we get nearer to consolidating MG's business with our own.

a detailed valuation review was kicked-off yesterday to ensure that MG's=20
valuation and reserving methodology is consistent with our own.

today a project team is being assembled to figure out how to migrate MG to=
=20
SAP. Given our experience of 1st October and 1st July go-lives this should =
be=20
a piece of cake!!


3)  Next Week

on Monday we will be presenting the Enron Model to MG to help them understa=
nd=20
where we are coming from! This will involve stepping them through our=20
definition of Roles & Responsibilities for each of the functional groups th=
at=20
make up the front, middle and back office, and introduce them to the variou=
s=20
Enron people who will be responsible for helping MG to transition to this=
=20
model over the coming months.


4) Out there somewhere...

The plan is still to move the entire London based MG business into Enron=20
House in mid-September though we may find some MG staff joining us before=
=20
then. MG run a fairly lean operation and the integration effort will requir=
e=20
Enron people on the ground to ensure that the ongoing business is not=20
adversely hampered as certain business processes are adapted to our model.=
=20
This will inevitably lead to new opportunities for people to move across to=
=20
the base metals business and visa versa...

The above is a fairly concise summary so if you'd like more information=20
please feel free to call me directly on x 34264.

Tim

I would like to have this same monthly reporting for all offices of the US.  
This sort of piggybacks off the discussion we had yesterday on the need for 
office information.

Do you have someone in your group who would have time to take on this 
project?  Should this project reside in your group or somewhere else?

If  you could give me your thoughts I'd appreciate it.

Shona

I am working within European Financial Operations on integrating the MG 
companies within the monthly status report for Enron offices - please see 
attached.  The data held so far on this document has been obtained from our 
records but may contain inaccuracies/ommissions due to the disparate nature 
of information.

In order to obtain an update on the progress made with the integration of the 
North American Trading and the Americas Origination companies I was hoping 
that you, or someone within your department, could add a short paragraph 
summarising the status of work taking place on each of the above companies 
and ensure that the details as noted are correct.

Many thanks for your assistance.

Best regards

Rob

There are clearly a large number of people who need to know what is happening 
on the integration of the MG metals business and a large number of fluid 
teams working on different aspects of the project; however, most issues 
related to the integration process will only be of interest to a subset of 
the people involved.

We currently have two main forums for information sharing available to 
members of the integration team:

The weekly newsletter produced by Fiona Grant in PR, which from 30 June 
onwards will be sent to EEL management and the heads of those departments 
represented on the Integration Team.
A weekly meeting on Friday mornings from 8am to 9am in NW1006, which has been 
put in place to provide team leaders with an opportunity to update the entire 
integration team on their top two or three issues for the past and/or coming 
week.  

For now, I expect the weekly update and the weekly meetings to meet the 
information needs of the integration team.  If you feel this is not adequate, 
then let either myself or Fiona Grant know and we'll do a re-think on the 
subject.

To this end, and in the interests of ensuring that we conclude our discussion 
in the allotted time, the following are a few organisational points I would 
like everyone to bear in mind when attending the Friday morning meeting:

Attendees should distinguish between presenters and audience at the weekly 
meeting. 
Presenters should attend if at all possible and, in the event they are unable 
to attend, should nominate a replacement for the meeting (replacements should 
be notified to Esther Gerratt in advance of the  Friday morning meeting if 
possible).

For the time being, presenters and their designated areas are:

- Eric Gadd  Commercial and Acquisition progress
- Amita Gosalia  EOL
- Justin Boyd  Legal
- Toby Knight  Premises
- Barry Sangster  IT infrastructure
- Bob Campbell  IT applications
- Richard Sage  Middle and Back Offices and Project Management
- Lloyd Fleming  RAC
- Tim Davies  Credit
- Anne Edgley  Finance
- Anne Hicks  Cash Management
- Janine Juggins  Tax
- Andrea Kerch  US GAAP and Due diligence
- Nigel Sellens  HR
- Fiona Grant  PR
- Bruce Garner  Business Development 
 
As  this is intended to be an "update"-only meeting, any unresolved 
substantive issues are to be taken off-line and the resolution reported the 
following week. 
Lastly, I would request that presenters focus on communicating, in an 
efficient manner, things which affect other functions within the integration 
process.  Doing so will assit other presenters in relaying the information 
presented at the meeting to other personnel in their respective areas.

I hope you find this useful.   We want to keep the information flowing as we 
continue the integration process, but at the same time we need to make sure 
we use our time wisely and efficiently.

Regards,
Eric

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with 
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the 
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any 
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales 
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day, 
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised 
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with 
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as 
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial 
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Regards,
Tim

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

To all

Tim has delivered the initial microsoft project plan for the MO integration - 
this is available to all via the integration project 'office' - i.e. Richard 
and Phil.

I summarise the key themes as :-

summary operational risk assessment across all MG entities and functional 
groups ( as defined within the DPR )
defining MO organisational structure and fit with Enron's control model - 
particularly logistics and co-ordination
interaction with Fin Ops processes
month end consolidation process
SAP implementation
working capital and revenue forecasting
interaction with RAC re VAR / trading limits ( market and credit )
awaiting notice of trading limits
credit counterparty review and set up within GCP
VAR methodology implementation
interaction with IT re systems development/maintenance
AS 400 development timetable and roll out to NY for WANG replacement
MITS/EOL migration
Use of Enlighten in application architecture
defined IT resource requirement
interaction with Legal re Enron Metals name change and related documentation 
issues
MO integration planning for settlements and trade accounting

The focus and objectives relating to the above for this week are as follows :-

review of London processes and define boundaries for segregation of duties 
implementation ( Action TPP ) - also discuss extension to NY ( SWilson )
review of Wolff activities in Germany ( Action KR/AC )
continuing review of new recycling yards ( project Cook ) in Germany ( Action 
AH/RJ )
review interdependencies between MO/Fin Ops/RAC/Systems integration plans ( 
Action MJ/RS )
document current assessment of operational risk with particular emphasis on 
Wolff and Recycling businesses ( Action MJ with KR/AC/AH/RJ/TPP/SW )
Brainstorm month end accounting close and potential earnings election for 
consolidation ( Action  TPP/MJ/BA/SWood )

Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim - 
says a lot about the way MG do business I think.

RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip 
Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a 
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have 
some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates 
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often 
discounted to realise cash!!

Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment 
yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were 
'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer 
preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the 
enforceability/legal risk here.

Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London - 
accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful

Will call later !

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

"Conditions of Purchase" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several "open" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Attached is a preliminary draft of the findings and proposed action steps for 
the MG - London controls review that was conducted this past week.  These 
findings arise solely out of discussions with key MG personnel who are listed 
within the attachment.  AA&Co. are still in the process of conducting the 
deal test which should be completed by Monday.  Any significant findings as a 
result of the deal test will then be added to this document.  Please review 
and direct any questions or comments back to me or Tim Poullain-Patterson by 
Monday, July 10.  Thanks.

Dear all,

As you know, we will be hosting staff from MG tomorrow evening and on 
Wednesday and Thursday evening for a presentation/overview on Enron and a 
tour of Enron House.  The MG Staff have not been selected by department for 
these events, but rather have been given the option to sign up on a 
first-come, first-serve basis.  I anticipate having approximately 35 people 
on Tuesday, 20 on Wednesday and 35 on Thursday.  The members of MG's 
management who joined us on the 8th of June are not attending this week in 
order to provide their colleagues with an opportunity to visit the building 
(hence the smaller numbers).

The purpose of these events is to help MG staff get better acquainted with 
Enron and to see first-hand where they will be relocating to in September.  
To this end, I would like to invite all of you to attend at least one of 
three events with a view to being on hand to act as a host/hostess, 
potentially join tours of the building and to be on hand to field any 
specific questions which may come up about your respective departments.  I 
hope this will also prove to be a good opportunity for you to meet MG staff 
on a more informal basis.  

The schedule of events each night will be as follows: 

17:45 - 18:00  MG Staff Arrive at Enron House

18:00 - 18:05  Welcome and Introductions:  Eric Gadd

18:05 - 18:15  Enron Video

18:15 - 18:40  Presentation on Enron and Enron Europe: Mark Schroeder 
(Tuesday)
         Fernley Dyson (Wednesday)
         John Thompson (Thursday)

18:40 - 19:30   Tours of Enron House/Drinks & Canap,s

19:30 - 19:45  Depart for Home by Bus to Liverpool Street Station [or 
Directly from Enron House]


I know that many of you have been keen to participate in this kind of 
informal event with our new colleagues at MG, so I hope you will be able to 
join us.   So that we can get a feel for numbers, I would appreciate it if 
you could RSVP to me by 2:00 p.m. tomorrow regarding your participation for 
all three events.  Please note that due to a number of Enron staff 
participating in the Chase Corporate Challenge on Wednesday evening, I am 
very short on "tour guides".  So, if you can make it on Wednesday evening and 
if you feel up to it, please advise if you can lead a tour of the building (a 
map and cheat sheet will be provided!!).

Regards,
Fiona

I know that Tim Jones is from MG, so he will be found in the ECT Europe 
External Address Book. In order to address him, I create a reply or new 
message and then click on the Address button. Change the address book from 
ECT or Enron to the ECT External Address Book:



At this point I need to skip down to the Jones' in the list, so I just type 
jones and a Quick Search dialogue box appears. Click OK and I go to the first 
of the Jones' llisted in this address book (Allan I think). It's a reasonably 
long list, but only one exists.



He's Tim R Jones, so I click on the 'To:' button to add him to the recipient 
list for the message.



This is a good procedure to pass on to others.

would need to be concerned about prior to the voting that is to take place 
this Friday.  The final report will be presented to me by early next week.  I 
will forward to you a copy at that time.  AA has assured me that no 
additional items of a significant nature will be added to the final report 
that are not already included in the final draft document.

If you have any questions/comments on the report please do not hesitate to 
give me a call.

Thanks

Subject: Metals Recycling action

I have discussed further with Joe.

Update on  African deal

We are still awaiting confirmation on the background checks for the 
counterparty - it seems unlikely that there is any link to government 
agencies.

There is no proof that the Recycling management in Hamburg gave any direct 
authorisation on this deal.  They do not see anything particularly wrong with 
it either - to them this is completely different to the Indian deals as they 
were not involved with preparing the documentation, merely accepting it from 
a third party.  They see the car purchase (second hand Toyota) as a simple 
payment mechanism rather than a bribe.

The instructions that they gave to their team in October was to cease all of 
the Indian deals - they seem not to have applied an ethical motive to this, 
but more a specific dictate covering India.  

Doug Imrie is currently reviewing all other international deals and is 
working through with Stephan Scheppler (the Manager of the Frankfurt office), 
what will and will not be acceptable going forward. A list of written 
instructions will be issued following this review. 

We do not believe that any action against Stephan Scheppler will help to 
achieve anything in terms of improvement in management going forward.  Under 
German law it would probably be very difficult to prove that he has acted 
against instructions (indeed he does not seem to have received the right 
instructions).

We do believe that to tighten the top management organisation would provide a 
firm and clear message to the management:  We can do this in two ways:

1.  To nominate Matz Heil (previously Bergman) to lead the 4 person 
management team (currently they are all equal and have individual approaches)
2.  To have him reporting directly into Rob Soeldner in order to give the 
commercial direction an Enron approach.

Joe will take steps to implement this when he returns from NY at the end of 
this week.  At this point we will communicate the action to Houston.

Sally- 

I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG 
acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to 
the list.

I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information 
gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill.  I think we may have an 
opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess 
MG's remote offices.  If Brent were to linger in London for a few more 
months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world 
and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  Brent's 
background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials 
for doing the job.  I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it 
seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.  What 
are your thoughts?

Subject: Weekly Update on MG Aquisition and Assimilation

I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on 
the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that 
distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that 
Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the 
aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management 
Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of 
operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports 
to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping 
me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will 
create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to 
fill.  

Thanks in advance to your attention to this.

Subject: MG : MO/BO Functional Groups and Reporting Lines

Please find attached a workbook comprising two worksheets. These worksheets 
illustrate how Support for the London based MG businesses - Financial Trading 
and Merchanting - plug in to the Enron Europe framework.



Org

This sheet illustrates the main reporting lines for the Front, Middle and 
Back Office(s) up to the "Office of the Chair" for Enron Europe. Though the 
Mechanting business is used for illustrative purposes, for Financial Trading 
simply substitute Mike Farmer and Howard Carter with Michael Hutchinson and 
Kevin Rhodes respectively.

Staff

This sheet simply attaches names to each of the Middle and Back Office 
functional groups indicated in the sheet entitled Org. Staff within the 
Middle Office functional groups have been introduced to the dual reporting 
concept whereby they report to both the Business Controller and Functional 
Lead. 

The intention is that quite soon after moving into Enron House the functional 
teams for both Financial Trading and Mechanting will start to more closely 
together. The influence of the Functional Leads should ensure that these 
teams are blended into a generic Enron Metals support group, where possible 
leveraging across the other trading support groups.

Any questions, please call x 34264.

Regards,
Tim

Very good cross over of ideas - I will push Andy to see the communication 
expand - there must be substantive correlation between these physical

Subject: Re: Metals  

Andy,

Thanks so much for your message.  I had you on my "To Do" list today to 
follow-up from our conversation last week.  I appreciate your responses, and 
will follow-up as needed.

Just to recap EIM's current inititives.

PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PWC) was engaged in 10/00 to develop a business plan 
for tactical and strategic solutions for the projected growth in the physical 
business.  In 11/00, AA was engaged to develop a "Blueprint" of EIM major 
processes (Deal Execution, Deal Capture, Risk Management, Logistics, 
Settlements and Financial Reporting), down to level 2 processes.  The 
initiatives have been combined into one team focused on delivering the 
"Blueprint", a gap analysis of Enron systems to business needs and 
recommended systems.  A complete "roadmap" should be laid out with a 
0-3months, 4-6months, 7-9 months and 10-12months timeline.  The plan 
addresses tactical also.  

Our overall objective:  Build an infrastructure (people, processes and 
systems) that is scalable and supports the trading business of EIM.  The 
current industries are Forest Products and Steel.  However, additional 
industries may be added.  The targeted infrastructure would require little 
change to support new industries.  

The delieverable is expected by the end of 2/01.  We'd be happy to visit with 
you all (video conference or Houston,....) to give you more information.  Let 
me know how to proceed.  

Thanks again for your time.  Since I wasn't able to attend the Controllers' 
Conference last 10/00, I'm glad I got to meet you last week.  Stay in touch.

Brenda

Subject: Metals

Brenda

As discussed at our meeting last week there are a few areas of commonality 
between Enron Metals and EIM that should allow leverage off common goals.

In particular I promised info on a few areas:

Project Q assessment

A lot of the issues raised in the report are particular to Enron Metals 
(being to do with interfaces with our AS400 ysstem) however high level issues 
which formed part of the decision to not develop this for Enron metals were:
Q is over specified for metals. Traffic / logistics for metals is less 
complex than oil & coal.
Metals process tends towards Buy>Store>Sell whereas for liquids the storage 
is not as prevelant
Metals logistics typically involves trucks whereas liquids is ship/barge

2.    Inventory Controls

Again the reports produced here have been very specific to Enron Metals. Paul 
Wallace a manager in the co-ordination function is working extensively on 
developing the controls in this area. I would suggest that you contact Paul 
directly if you wish to discuss specific areas or inventory controls in 
general.

3.    Funding of inventory

We have a structured finance facility here in London. The deal is specific to 
Enron Metals markets in that it works by reference to LME prices as these are 
the base index for all the positions placed in the facility. If structured 
financing is sort for EIM then it would be appropriate to talk to either 
David Tregar (Metals Commercial) or Bill Appleby (Global Finance) as an intro 
to the issues faced.

4.    Curve Management Process

The markets in which our merchanting division trades are based on the LME 
curves but are linked to a large number of basis curves for quality and 
location. Given the vast number we have opted to break down the markets by 
brand group and port location. E.G. for Copper this means we have a grid with 
5 brand groups and 3 sets of port groups (13 for europe, 7 for the US and 6 
for the Far East). The maintaince & price testing of the grids is made 
manageable by the fact the premiums only need be entered for brand and port 
groups by the traders yet prices can be tested by reference to node points 
i.e. price of  specific brand at a given location which can be checked to a 
market quote.

5.    Re recruitment of paper traders

I haven't been able to contact him but I recall that the brother of David 
Rosenblum, one of the metals traders in Chicago, is a trader of recylced 
paper.

I'll keep you posted on long term system development plans here in London. 
I'd appreciate same for EIM.

Regards
Andy

Subject: MG Middle Office Integration Issues and timetable

To all

Tim has delivered the initial microsoft project plan for the MO integration - 
this is available to all via the integration project 'office' - i.e. Richard 
and Phil.

I summarise the key themes as :-

summary operational risk assessment across all MG entities and functional 
groups ( as defined within the DPR )
defining MO organisational structure and fit with Enron's control model - 
particularly logistics and co-ordination
interaction with Fin Ops processes
month end consolidation process
SAP implementation
working capital and revenue forecasting
interaction with RAC re VAR / trading limits ( market and credit )
awaiting notice of trading limits
credit counterparty review and set up within GCP
VAR methodology implementation
interaction with IT re systems development/maintenance
AS 400 development timetable and roll out to NY for WANG replacement
MITS/EOL migration
Use of Enlighten in application architecture
defined IT resource requirement
interaction with Legal re Enron Metals name change and related documentation 
issues
MO integration planning for settlements and trade accounting

The focus and objectives relating to the above for this week are as follows :-

review of London processes and define boundaries for segregation of duties 
implementation ( Action TPP ) - also discuss extension to NY ( SWilson )
review of Wolff activities in Germany ( Action KR/AC )
continuing review of new recycling yards ( project Cook ) in Germany ( Action 
AH/RJ )
review interdependencies between MO/Fin Ops/RAC/Systems integration plans ( 
Action MJ/RS )
document current assessment of operational risk with particular emphasis on 
Wolff and Recycling businesses ( Action MJ with KR/AC/AH/RJ/TPP/SW )
Brainstorm month end accounting close and potential earnings election for 
consolidation ( Action  TPP/MJ/BA/SWood )

It strikes me that the planning documentation could be enormously useful to 
us in backtesting our existing processes and determining any potential 
overlaps

Is there any obstacle to access to this information ?

Dear Mike,

A lot of the needs listed in Tim's memo will also be needed in NY, but on a 
smaller scale.  I'll put a resource requirement memo together by the end of 
the week and then we can determine who would fit these requirements and where 
these people should come from (London/Houston).

I think this project would be a great opportunity for some 
analysts/associates (of course working under experienced personnel).

Regards

Shona

Subject: Re: MG Integration : Resource Requirements  

A good tee up - and one we should regularly reassess - here goes some initial 
feedback which you should push back on :-

Valuation review - resource requirement to be defined in detail by Andy in 
his new role - I think the offer from Eric of finding some Analysts and 
Associates for the short term assessment may be the immediate answer.

Balance Sheet substantiation - at present I assess the power and gas 
substantiation process as priority - although we should review the resources 
coming free from Global ( Chris and Rashpal ) as they may not be easily 
useable by Raewyn - Chris is free at present and Rashpal promised for 
Thunderball. Whilst I am as concerned as you are we should reassess level of 
risk because
AA would have done ( could do more ? ) some substantive / due diligence on 
balance sheet
The trade accountants at MG had a simplistic entity structure based around an 
infrastructure where the AS400 did both the DPR and account posting  - unlike 
our own systems - so inherent risk is lower ( excluding inventory )
we must make certain our efforts are aligned to Fin Ops !

Inventory - interesting one this - it should be very accurately controlled 
already ( it is the business ??? ) yet the problem is that it is not 
transparent at the consolidation level. I would like you to get David Tregar 
to assess the level of risk with you ( and discuss with me and Philip Lord 
the current securitisation of inventory ) before we put an action plan in 
place for this balance sheet category

Integration / Controls - you should continue your efforts to bring the MG 
priority to the functional stripe leaders' agenda - after Friday's meeting 
they know the effort required are that recruitment is key

SAP - we will look to Michael Heap on this ( but we did identify some key 
business analysis work for Kevin Rhodes to be done ASAP - we should track 
this )

Remote offices - continues to be the dog that has not barked ( YET ) - 
Richard, you and I need to rethink where we are  - particularly with South 
America

Overall - we both agree more resources are required but they have to be 
scoped quite precisely !

Thanks for the note

Subject: MG Integration : Resource Requirements

Mike,

As you know we still have a very full issues list and we are spreading the 
few resources we have on ground pretty thinly, leaving a residue of partially 
completed tasks that will need to be revisited at some point. Also, though we 
are leveraging MG staff where we can, we have already made an assessment that 
their support infrastructure is very lean - this is being stretched to 
breaking point by the RW acquisition and various Enron integration 
initiatives, e.g. establishing functional teams.

At present we have the following resources on the ground:



We are continuing to identify issues that add to our assessment of 
operational risk. If we are to reduce this risk to an acceptable level we 
need to commit additional resources to the project. 

I assess our current resource needs as follows:

Valuation Review : the valuation review that Andy and I performed prior to 
"effective control" date identified a number of complex valuation issues that 
require further quantitative analysis. Also, there is imbedded optionality in 
a lot of the physical business transacted throughout MG which should be 
modelled to determine the correct valuation and accounting treatment (and if 
there is any extra value to be extracted - Eric Gadd has recently prioritised 
this!). Requirement - risk manager with developed quantitative/modelling 
skills.

Balance Sheet Substantiation : a comprehensive validation of balances 
including a review of reconciliation's, evidence of account ownership 
(detection of "88888"'s accounts etc...) is overdue. Requirement - lead 
accountant plus two juniors.

Inventory : a lot more analysis is required of the global inventory balances 
- see earlier note to Eric Gadd. Requirement - one/two risk manager(s).

General Integration : having now identified the functional leads for MG in 
London,  we are now due to involve the "stripe leaders" in the process of 
creating the functional groups, including identifying gaps in resourcing. I 
will not prejudge the outcome beyond saying that each functional group will 
need extra staff that I am expecting the "stripe leaders" to provide. 
Requirement - to be determined by "stripe leaders".

SAP : ??? Requirement - to be determined by SAP project team.

Remote Offices : the above requests relate to the London office only. Having 
identified Enron Controllers for the offices in the Far East I do not 
envisage significant issues integrating those offices. However, I have 
minimal understanding of what our requirements in the US and South America 
are, and propose deferring that discussion to another time...

Regards,
Tim

Plenty to do.  They should definitely be on SAP sooner rather than later.  
Also, I think we should agree on a game plan for reviewing trading controls 
ASAP.  Alot of offices out there.  Thanks.

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

Regards
Andy

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

Interesting information floating up from some detailed review work by Tim - 
says a lot about the way MG do business I think.

RE NY we should ask the same questions - what prepayments exist ( Philip 
Bacon seemed uncomfortable with the need for a DASH for each prepayment on a 
contract ) add to this the absence of credit people in NY and we may have 
some issues - although Marcelo and others stressed the fact that Concentrates 
appeared to move no product without a letter of credit, which was then often 
discounted to realise cash!!

Shona we should also discuss the legal contract issue - another comment 
yesterday from Philip was that each of his concentrates contracts were 
'unique' - whilst I can accept that each may be tailored to customer 
preferences - they still need to be CACSed - we should look at the 
enforceability/legal risk here.

Whilst information prepayment risk for Metals should come from London - 
accessing any relevent inofrmation from NY may be helpful

Will call later !

Subject: MG : Russian Prepayment Exposure

The situation at present is as follows:

MG have nine open contracts with four counterparties sourcing mainly copper 
from the Russian Federation on a prepayment basis

all contracts are on a floating price basis (LME less discount)

notional value of each contract is circa $0.5-3mm

prepayment is on a unsecured trade finance basis, for between 90-95% value 
with balance on exchange of title evidenced by documents

The issues break down into three broad areas:

1) Commercial

At present Enron does not engage in prepayment activities with Russian 
Federation counterparties.

No further prepayments are permitted until RAC have performed a DASH for this 
activity. As this is likely to take several weeks Howard will liase with 
Commercial to manage issues with existing prepayment counterparties arising 
from this suspension. Howard and David Hardy will also take immediate steps 
to manage down existing prepayment exposures.

2) Legal

Based on a cursory review of the confirmations by Robert, if we are to 
continue this activity Legal need to instructed to perform a full review for 
several reasons, including:

the confirmations contain ambiguous language concerning basic economic terms, 
e.g. pricing date

they are light on the mechanics of the prepayments, and are generally not 
constructed in an appropriate way for this type of activity.

"Conditions of Purchase" are attached to the confirmations which refer to 
English Law, but as they are not always countersigned, under conflict rules 
the closest or real connection may be deemed to be Russian law which, in the 
absence of a properly executed agreement raises concerns about enforceability.

there are several "open" contracts with volumetric shortfalls where we are 
beyond the delivery period, and which could be considered to have been 
discharged by breach. Again the confirmation does not contain adequate 
language.

3) Credit/Operational

There are no formal counterparty limits. Nor are prepayment and volumetric 
exposures tracked on a contract by contract basis. This information is 
necessarily to ensure transparency over contract performance, and needs to be 
factored into the overall credit monitoring process.

David has requested this information from MG, and will follow up this one off 
exercise by introducing a spreadsheet workaround to enable us to track 
exposures based on the methodology developed for Helsinki.


Further work is required to quantify our exposures and to demonstrate that, 
despite the issues identified with contractual terms, there is performance 
against the contracts. David is pursuing this from a Credit perspective and 
will report back to his group his findings by Friday latest.

The issues raised regarding contractual language suggest that we need to 
accelerate a planned review of contract language for all MG's activities in 
all jurisdictions. Mike and I will discuss bringing this review forward with 
Justin.

Any questions, please call.

Regards,
Tim

By now, most of you are aware that Enron will be acquiring London-based MG=
=20
Plc, one of the world=01,s leading metals marketers.  In connection with ou=
r=20
on-going activities relating to MG Plc, I thought it would be helpful to=20
provide you with a brief overview of on our future new metals business, to=
=20
further explain the reasons underlying the acquisition and to update you on=
=20
the integration team=01,s accomplishments to date.

What is MG Plc?
MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, whi=
ch=20
provides a variety of services to the global metals industry. The business=
=20
dates back to 1881 when it was the German Metallgesellschaft Group and was=
=20
active in trading metals from its head office in Frankfurt.  Today, MG is o=
ne=20
of the world=01,s top non-ferrous metals brokers and market makers, the wor=
ld=01,s=20
leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other=20
non-ferrous metals.

MG is comprised of two core areas of expertise, the Financial Services and=
=20
Merchanting Divisions.  The Financial Services Division was formed in 1970 =
to=20
provide market-making and trading services to the MG=01,s physical metals=
=20
trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal=20
Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the la=
te=20
1980s, as a result of London=01,s growing leading role in the metals indust=
ry,=20
MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed=
=20
its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the=
=20
Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were=
=20
combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock=20
Exchange.  Currently, MG=01,s core trading offices are located in London an=
d New=20
York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New=20
Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,=20
Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New=
=20
Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.

What does the Merchanting Division do?
The Merchanting Division is the world=01,s leading independent copper merch=
ant,=20
one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nicke=
l=20
and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. T=
he=20
division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals=20
Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.

The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:

? Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals =01) MG trades as a principal with prod=
ucers=20
and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates=20
(particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and=20
locations and lending and borrowing metals.
? Global Stockholding =01) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehou=
ses=20
around the world.
? Merchanting of Recycled Metal =01) MG trades as a principal with supplier=
s and=20
consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.
? Terminal Market Operations =01) MG participates in the LME and COMEX usin=
g=20
hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting=20
activity.

What does the Financial Services Division do?
The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, base=
d=20
on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals=20
warehousing businesses.

The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:

? Brokerage Activities =01) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in L=
ME=20
and COMEX contracts.
? Market-Making =01) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options cont=
racts=20
and COMEX and OTC contracts.
? Warehousing =01) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in=
=20
Europe, the United States and Asia.

MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet=
=20
as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint=
=20
venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,=
=20
L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The=
=20
joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide=20
business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metal=
s=20
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options=
=20
contracts.

Why is Enron acquiring MG?
Enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesal=
e=20
markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metal=
s,=20
Enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer=
=20
customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which=
=20
link different commodities and inputs.

MG will provide Enron with a number of important benefits.  At the same tim=
e,=20
Enron expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with=
=20
Enron.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:

? The opportunity to combine Enron=01,s core competencies in trading, finan=
ce=20
and origination with MG=01,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.

? The ability for both Enron and MG to access new clients, particularly in=
=20
the United States and Europe.

? The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such =
as=20
bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.

? The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing i=
ts=20
financial strength and the resources available to it.

? The chance to overlay the EnronOnline business-model on the metals indust=
ry=20
to increase liquidity and contract market share.

What remains to be done?
Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated=20
companies such as Enron and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidab=
le=20
and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integratio=
n,=20
but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the=
=20
conditional offer period, Enron and MG are taking steps to prepare for a=20
seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations. =20
Ideally, when Enron=01,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (=
15=20
July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with thei=
r=20
feet running.

In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate th=
at=20
smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes=
=20
forward, Enron and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to Enron=
=01,s=20
offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders =
as=20
well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.

A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of o=
ur=20
integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.  Integratio=
n=20
activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations: commercial=
=20
matters, financial matters, middle and back office issues; and, most=20
importantly, on the employees of both organisations.  Some of the most=20
important goals relating to each of these areas are:

Commercial
? Developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on EnronOnline a=
nd=20
installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data=
=20
transfers and information flows between MG and Enron.
? Preparing a joint venture management plan for MG's interest in EMETRA tha=
t=20
is consistent with Enron=01,s goal of listing physical metal contracts on=
=20
EnronOnline.
? Identifying opportunities to
- combine Enron's core competencies in trading, finance, and origination wi=
th=20
MG's global position in trading non-ferrous metals;
- leverage MG=01,s position by increasing its financial strength and resour=
ces=20
available to it;
- cross-market both existing and new products to Enron and MG customers,=20
particularly in the US and Europe; and
- grow MG's metal trading franchise.

Financial
? Obtaining waivers from MG's banks in respect of change of control in loan=
=20
or other agreements.
? Preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in pla=
ce=20
funding arrangements for August 2000 onwards.
? Preparing plans to arrange large-scale inventory securitisation to reduce=
=20
balance sheet debt before year-end.

Middle and Back Office
? Preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise=20
integration benefits including, pro-forma consolidated financial statements=
;=20
profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000; and=20
integration budgets.
? Determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems (AS400, SAP=
).
? Assessing  MG's core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to=20
incorporate risk profiles in MG's metals books into Enron systems. =20
? Evaluating IT systems and infra-structure at all MG office + warehouse=20
locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide MG staff with=20
access to Enron IT systems and applications.

People
? Preparing a programme to co-locate MG's London staff (145) at Enron House=
=20
over the weekend of 16/17 September.
? Developing plans to harmonize compensation, benefits, and employment=20
policies and practices; developing plans for staff reporting relationships.
? Communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of Enron's and=
=20
MG's organizations.
? Arranging introductions between Enron and MG staff and providing=20
opportunities for information exchanges.

Where do we go from here?
I believe that Enron=01,s acquisition of MG is an exciting opportunity for =

all.  While a number of steps remain to be taken, we have already=20
successfully begun the integration of Enron and MG.  By remaining=20
enthusiastic and committed to this process, I expect that this transition=

will proceed smoothly and with a minimum of difficulty.

How about this for a business model for an origination and trading outfit.

salesperson talks to customer
customer agrees to trade
salesperson phones trading desk and gets price (trading desk is London or NY 
- NB: all lines are taped) 
salesperson tell customer
customers says ok
salesperson says "done" to customer and trading desk
trading desk books deal, middle and back office processes kicks in, sends out 
and chases up confirm etc
accounting process identifies value added by salesperson and gives them a 
piece of the price as a credit
no bank accounts or signing authority in sales office 
no accountants, middle office people or other similar humans in the sales 
office, just sales people
all hedging and risk taking resident in trading books in NY or London

Can we not make this work ?

Bjorn

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being 
dealt with internally. 

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option 
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of 
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets 
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible 
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

As a practical matter the procedures outlined are not workable. We need to 
find a way to go forward that works and can satisfy all concerned. 

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Either the people in these offices can be entrusted to transact and execute 
business or we should consider closing these offices and relocating some of 
the people which I do not believe makes any sense at all.

Hi,

As you will have seen today in     an announcement is to be made on the 
London Stock Exchange this afternoon stating we have gone wholly 
unconditional on our offer to acquire MG plc.

Though the accounting consolidation date will be the end of the month, we 
will effectively "own" the trading positions as of close of business 
yesterday (if anyone wants clarification on the distinction between these two 
dates please call). Therefore, as far as possible we need to have a 
recognisable "middle office" in place to ensure transparency of trading 
positions and results, efficient and controlled operational processes, 
segregation of duties; in a nutshell, no accidents!

So, where are we...

1) Last Week ...

Valuation Review - Andy Cornfield and I completed a detailed review of 
trading positions and associated valuations to ensure that from cob 
yesterday, all positions were correctly valued in line with Enron's valuation 
methodology.

SAP - Wayne Andrews (Project Apollo Director) was over from Houston to 
kick-off the "MG migration to SAP" project. Michael Heap will be leading this 
project from London with a focus on establishing a project plan over the next 
few weeks.

Remote Offices -  MG have offices all over the world and it is important to 
distinguish between "trading" offices, that are permitted to "commit" the 
firm, and origination and representative offices that service the "trading" 
offices. Enron staff have been visiting all of MG's offices over the past few 
weeks so we can ensure that appropriate controls are established around the 
different types of office. 

2) This Week

DPR -  yesterday Sheila Foo produced a DPR for the entire MG operation, 
sub-divided into five distinct business units for onward reporting to Enron 
and MG senior management. Mary Thambiah will be consolidating the results 
with those of Enron Europe from cob today - the first day we "own" MG's 
trading results.

Doorstep and Process Review - a "Doorstep" controls review was performed by 
Brent Price two weeks ago, and provisional findings noted. However, a deal 
test is still outstanding and we are inviting AA back to this week to 
complete it. We are also asking AA to document work flow and systems 
processes so we have a better understanding of the integration points as we 
move the MG business on to the Enron Middle Office model.

3) Lastly, attention model train enthusiasts...

MG have about eight meters of LGB standard gauge track, a couple of 
locomotives and an array of rolling stock - problem is that the network fell 
over a couple of weeks ago (I blame it on Gerald Corbett!). Are there any 
model train enthusiasts out there prepared to give up some of there time to 
fix it? Any offers for help will be accepted on a confidential basis - 
anonymity assured!!

Please don't hesitate to call if you have any questions on any of the above x 
34264.

Regards,
Tim

The plan looks good - but is not fully implemented.  I've left a message with 
Marcelo to get an update on what the status is. I'll fill you in once we've
