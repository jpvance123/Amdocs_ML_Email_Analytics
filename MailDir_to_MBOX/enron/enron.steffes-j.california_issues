I met with Gary Fergus and we determined the  need to prepare affidavits and/or exhibits as part of our August 15th showing in the Califronia refund case. 

Exhbits in a FERC case require supporting documents and a sponsor (witness).

 I am trying to contact various people on getting the data together but here are the parameters of the exhibits:

Witness designations are preliminary.

1. EPMI's receivables from ISO/PX
What it shows:  ISO owes us $41.5 million and the PX $9.1 million plus any claims we want to make w.r.t. letters of credit with the PX
Sponsor: Tracy Ngo (PX data) and Murray O'Neil (ISO data)  (Tracy has agreed to prepare the exhibit but wants support from Murray's group on the ISO numbers.) 

2. EPMI's "receivables" from ISO for the underscheduling penalty
What it shows:  ISO has yet to actually implement the underscheduling penalty but has been tracking it.  According to information provided Chris Stockly, EPMI would receive $30 million of penalty revenues 
Sponsor:  Chris Stokley or Murray O'Neil

3. Enron's PX credit receivables
What it shows:  PG&E and SCE collectively owe EES $500 million
Sponsor: Steve Swain or ??

Please forward to others who need this information.

As you know, Enron's been involved with a group of business customers, small customers, labor and enviros trying to hammer out a core/noncore proposal that would act as a key modification to Edison's MOU with the Governor.

Today, the Assembly leadership released a bill (AB 82XX) that modifies the MOU but does not follow the core/noncore proposal negotiated by the group.  The bill just came out, is about 80 pages long, and thorough analysis has not yet been completed.  The URL for the bill is attached.  Based on a meeting attended this morning in Sacramento,the key features of the bill( which is attached) are:

Direct Access suspended until 1.1.2003 (suspension presumably effective on the effective date of the bill)
Transmission sale at 2X book.
Approximately 90% (or greater) of Edison's undercollection absorbed by customers 20KW and above.
Create a Trust to address the money owed to the generators and offer the generators 70 cents on the dollar (but does not do away with the suits, investigations, etc.)
The bill is completely silent regarding who will pay for the DWR contracts and what the payment structure will look like.

Reaction and Timetable
Very chaotic, with considerable uncertainty about where (if anywhere) the bill will go, leaving many to believe that bankruptcy remains a strong possibility.
Business customers (and of course Enron) are strongly opposed
Republicans are strongly opposed
Labor has big problems with the Tx sale unless they get assurances that TX labor jobs are guaranteed, which is not yet included in the bill
We are working with business to remove the Direct Access suspension
We are also working on the Senate side to attempt to get the Senate to include Direct Access in their version of the modified MOU, but the Senate has been more hostile than the Assembly to Direct Access.
Senate Democrats still intend to run a bill that delinks payment of the bonds to repay General Fund for power already purchased from the DWR contracts. AB82XX does not address this issue.
Senate Democrats also intend to craft their own version of a "modified MOU."  Word is that the Senate will release their bond language and their "modified" MOU this weekend or early next week.
The Assembly will hold an "informational" hearing on the bill tomorrow (Saturday) to get members up to speed
The Assembly will have a committee hearing and vote on the bill on Monday, with the intent of sending the bill to the full Assembly for a vote on Tuesday.
The Legsilature is supposed to have a month-long recess beginning Friday, July 20th, which requires that both the budget and the energy issue get resolved by then, or suspend the recess and continue working

Will continue to provide updates as events unfold. If folks have additional comments on the bill, please direct them to Harry Kingerski and Leslie Lawner, who will ensure that they get into the hands of our lobbyists in Sacramento.

If there are any questions, my pager is 888.916.7184.

Best,
Jeff

I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything.  

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues associated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve Swain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is to have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th.  

Current Issues:
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undetermined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)
2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised PX credits 
4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charges), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions
6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE


The four proposals are as follows:

SCE Recommended Approach 
	This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the 	gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no 	generation/commodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  will be applicable to Direct Access customers.  

	Enron would request the following:
	1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES or EEMC
	2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an "allowable claim" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possible.  
	3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument 
	4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility parent 	level. 
	5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC 

	Other consideration:
	Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


PG&E Recommended Approach
	This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 18, 2001 would include an "avoided cost"  component.  This avoided cost  
	component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.  	This resulting "avoided cost" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purchase 	costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation.  
	
	Enron would request the following:
	Same as above

	Other Consideration:
	Enron  would continue to be exposed to "price" risk attributable to the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper 	Enron's ability 	to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio. 

Hybrid Approach
	This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is 	applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal. 

	Enron would request the following:
	Same as SCE and PG&E approach

	Other considerations:
	Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re CTC or other surcharge amounts.  


Enron Model 
	This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.   

	Enron would request the following:
	It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is 	the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the "value"	Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and CPUC.

	Other considerations:
	This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge "price" risk, but this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the 	actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we concluded in Wednesday's meeting.

Thanks,
Wanda Curry

I pulled the recent forward curves (confidential; not for external release without approval from West Power) and computed the stranded costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Assuming SP15 on peak (which is conservative since many of the contracts had off peak energy in them) the total overmarket is $21 billion, or $13 billion discounted at 12%.  The former number is most comparable to the $40+ billion DWR expenditure commitement number.

If we want to use this for any sort of external message I would like to refine further.

Alan

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.  Some tidbits:

New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.  They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.  Good luck there.  Their meeting with SCE is 11/6.

New Energy -- New Energy returned all customers (but one) before May 2000. The one customer -- Krogers (grocery store chain) -- has been very active at the Legislature on this and will attend the SCE meeting. No meeting has been set up but one is expected next week. Has been more willing to talk about "cost shifting" but thinks SCE's proposal is ludicrous. I suggested it would be a bad idea to go down SCE's cost shifting road right now. Is outraged by SCE's proposal.

APSES --  Is outraged by SCE's proposal. Told SCE he wouldn't meet until SCE gives him the proposed payment amount and substantiation for it. He believes that SCE has no way to determne an accurate number.  He will also insist that SCE true-up the amount, once the ISO hits the utilities with the underscheduling penalty.  And finally, he will insist that SCE complete the PX Credit audit before he'll agree to a number.  APSES is the other party with a complaint filed at the Commission. His new contracts put his customers at risk for changes to the PX Credit mechanism, so his issue is primarily collecting the past amount due.

Strategic Energy -- Only does business in San Diego.

Commonwealth -- Minimal exposure.

At the request of the TFG Steering Committee, we are circulating the testimony prepared by Richard Tabors that Powerex plans to submit regarding the special features of hydropower systems and their role in the PNW.  This is testimony that the TFG or a number of its members may wish to support or refer to at hearing.  The text is a slightly modified version of what Powerex filed at the July 9 hearing in the settlement conferences before Judge Wagner.

We will be circulating Richard's draft testimony on economic issues later this afternoon for TFG review.

Also, please be advised that the Steering Committee suggests that Ripple Claim testimony that TFG members may file individually contain an aggregate gross refund number, and refer to the number of sellers who would be responsible for the refunds.  To keep peace in the family, the Steering Committee recommends that individual sellers with refund responsibility NOT be named.  Since this testimony will not be admitted into evidence and will not be subject to cross, but will be placed in the record as an offer of proof, the Steering Committee believes that work papers need not be supplied.  So the identities of the first wave Ripple Claim respondents  need not be revealed under this approach.

Please be advised that Powerex intends to submit its Ripple Claim testimony  on the basis recommended by the Steering Committee.

Mike Day and I talked.  Mike agreed that there's "elbow room" in PUC regulations that would allow PG&E to do the financial swap we talked about late yesterday without having to get regulatory approval.  However, Mike also agreed that there's some risk (moderate to low in our view) that the PUC could try to ding the utility--for whatever reason--next time it goes under review as part of its general rate case.  In the end, PG&E will have to decide whether doing the financial with us is--in PG&E's view--overly aggressive or not from a regulatory perspective.  In short, doesn't seem to be any real downside in raising it and seeing how PG&E responds.  If this doesn't answer the question sufficiently, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Quick adder:  It appears that the utilities took a hard line on the amendment issue in their written comments, which is no surprise.  Utilities position is obviously extreme but it means there's likely to be a signficant fight over the issue.

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

I don't agree Edison's premise -- that "direct access customers contributed=
 just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as bundled service=
 customers." We need to make clear that we don't buy in to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to bu=
y power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA customers.=
  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load coupled with high =
wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was the direct reason for =
the undercollection. I can make the argument that the undercollection is SO=
LELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.  I w=
ill explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 -- payments=
 of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real delay in any co=
mpetitive retail market until their costs were paid off.  One of the tradeo=
ffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR HIGH PRICES in the WH=
OLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there were high gas prices or =
bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed and not collect their bill=
ions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk they agreed to.  Now, they ar=
e claiming that they were ENTITLED to that money and more.  This is in dire=
ct conflict with the statute. I can make the argument that the statute requ=
ires SCE to assume this risk and therefore any undercollection is theirs al=
one -- now the CPUC can bail them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject=
 to any presumed "undercollection."

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to do=
 a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and the =
retail busness from T&D. So, they did a "top-down" calculation.  This meant=
 that there had to be a "credit" put on the bills of DA customers to accoun=
t for the costs the utility avoided by having the customers switch to DA. S=
o, the PX Credit structure was a direct result of the utilities unwillingne=
ss to unbundle specific components of the rates.  Next, although bundled cu=
stomers rates were capped, the decisions from the CPUC made it clear that t=
here was no similar cap for DA customers -- their rates and bills would be =
whatever was charged by their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed thei=
r tariffs with the CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neithe=
r proposed nor authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got no=
where, until WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our a=
rgument was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA cust=
omers -- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilit=
ies avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is f=
undamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have thought w=
e had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The settlement was accept=
ed by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone understood that eliminatin=
g the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to allow the PX Credit to FLOAT AB=
OVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were high. So, we have a legal right to r=
eceive the full PX Credit/Negative CTC which is separate and distinct from =
any undercollection associated with bundled customers. It seems as if we sh=
ould be able to prosecute this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an at=
torney)=20

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

Jim--here is the relevant language.  Customer pays all "Special DA Charges."


"Special DA Charges" means any charges, fees, assessments, adders or surcharges imposed or authorized by any Governmental Authority on "direct access" customers (regardless of whether any such charge is also imposed on other classes or types of customers), however styled or payable, that are related to (i) a Utility's, ISO's or Governmental Authority's energy procurement, including, without limitation, charges for system reliability, rate recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortization of above market purchases and energy load repurchases; or (ii) public purpose programs, including, without limitation, environmental, social/low income, renewable energy utilization, and demand side management programs.  Such charges will apply regardless of whether the energy requirements of the Accounts are being supplied by us or the applicable Utility.

Couple of additional pieces of information:

In conjunction with the issue paying ESPs past due PX amounts, Edison has affirmed that it will be making a proposal regarding how it wants to calculate the PX credit going forward.
It remains unclear whether Edison will try to fold controversial issues into negotiations on getting paid past due PX credit amounts(e.g., PX credit contributed to undercollection and therefore DA customers should help pay down the undercollection; DA customers must pay for stranded DWR contracts, etc.).  
So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.
Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.
Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.

Best,
Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

Vicki,

As you requested, this e-mail describes the current status of the 1 cent surcharge.

1.  The 1 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in early January.  At the time, the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM), to which we belong, had protested its application to DA customers. Nonetheless, the CPUC approved the surcharge and its application to all customers, including DA customers, because of the "emergency" nature of the situation and because it was "temporary."

2.  The 3 cent surcharge was approved by the CPUC in the March 27 order.  Once again, AReM had protested its application to DA customers.  This time the CPUC explicitly exempted DA customers and stated that the surcharge was for generation-related costs going forward.  The CPUC also made the one cent surcharge permanent but did not address its application to DA customers -- therefore, in my view, the earlier decision still stands on that issue. As AReM had suggested, the CPUC also stated that DA Customers would NOT be billed for the surcharge NOR given any credit for it.

3.  The March order required the utilities to file Advice Letters to implement the surcharges.  This was done in April (I think) but the SCE and PG&E took two different approaches.  SCE, because of billing system limitations, decided to violate the CPUC order in its implementation -- it billed DA customers for BOTH surcharges but then gave them a CREDIT that included both surcharges. PG&E, on the other hand, did NOT charge DA customers for the 3 cent surcharge nor include it in any credit -- in compliance with the CPUC March order.  However, PG&E continued to charge the 1 cent surcharge to DA customers in compliance with the CPUC's January order.

4.  AReM filed comments/protests on the utility advice letters -- in May, I believe.  AReM supported SCE's approach for not charging the 1 cent surcharge and for looking the closest to a "bottoms-up" calculation. AReM did mention that SCE should NOT be charging then crediting the surcharges, however.  AReM supported PG&E's approach of neither charging nor crediting the surcharge -- but opposed PG&E's continued charging of the 1 cent surcharge.  AReM agreed with SCE that, given the discussion in the March order and the application of the surcharges to generation-related costs going forward, the 1 cent surcharge should NOT apply to DA customers.

5.  When Advice Letters are protested, the Energy Division staff of the CPUC prepares a Resolution that recommends how to address the protested issues.  The Resolution is then presented to the CPUC at a meeting and voted on. Usually we have between one day and one week to see the Resolution before it is voted on. No Resolution has come forward on these Advice Letters.  The CPUC has no time requirement for when Advice Letters must be resolved.

6.  Discussions between AReM members and the Energy Division staff indicate that the staff agrees with AReM and will support AReM's request when it drafts the Resolution.

7.  Initiating a formal change to the January order on the 1 cent surcharge would require the filing of a Petition to Modify (usually done within a year -- but I believe can be requested at any time thereafter with a special motion).  This would begin a formal process -- also WITH NO TIME LINE.  It would also bring out the big guns opposing direct access -- the unions and TURN (a supposed small customer advocacy group) -- making quick response and a win for AReM more problematic.

8.  AReM has decided to work with the Energy Division staff and see if we can get a favorable Resolution kicked out by the end of September. (The Energy Division staff is overloaded right now with all the DWR-related decisions required for the 8/23 meeting.) If not, AReM will consider making a formal Petition to Modify.

9.  I recommend that Enron continue with its current strategy to work through AReM to achieve a favorable outcome on the 1 cent surcharge.

This is interesting. Prepared for IEP using data, I assume, from the K. Connell website. Possibly useful in response to EOB's latests rehearing request to fold in DWR contracts into the refund proceeding?

Jim,

Price is the most crucial assumption in the entire analysis I am sending the worksheet and the assumptions made. We can if we all agree and I shall cross-check with Henwood, use Henwood prices instead of our prices. That would not take long

Jim, would it be logical to go back to March 27 (or whatever the date of the order was made that made this permanent).  And I'm not sure how it could hurt us with our customers.  They have a fixed price contract.  We absorbed this charge.  Wouldn't the refund be ours?

Bob --

For certain we are seeking to not have the 1 c/kwh Surcharge post March 2002.  I think that I would be happy to begin to try and get the CPUC to modify their Order right now, but my real concern (maybe unfounded) is that we don't want the CPUC to go all the way back to Jan 4 and refund the 1c/kwh to Direct Access customers.  I thought this would harm EES given our de-dasr activities?  This is what I mean by "finessing" the issue too much.  The only legitimate positions are no application back to Jan 4 or to fight for a clean-up after the retail rate freeze ends.

I make this based on the following.  First, it is hard for EES to push much at the CPUC.  Second, after the CPUC takes what will be a potentially direct access killing action on Aug 23, I don't think they are going to be interested in dealing with a "detail" that matters for only for direct access customers.  Finally, I need to understand the value of this effort in line with the other key value drivers - and also, are you completely sure that there isn't a change (however unforseen) that could hurt another of our positions.  Let's not create a fuss if the outcome could be harmful.

I'm ready to push for this, but I want to make sure that everyone on the business side understands the issues.

Jim

Jim, first let me say that this is great for someone like me who is relatively new to California.  Next, with respect to item 6, this implies to me that we are not seeking relief from  the 1 cent except for the post-March 2002 time period.  Have I misread this?  Also, I don't think a ruling by the Commission either way could negatively affect our "tax" argument.  I view them as alternative ways to get to the same point.

Attached please find the write-up on California.  

The paper includes four sections - (1) Background & Status, (2) Upcoming Issues & Recommendations, (3) Legislative and Regulatory History of California Restructuring, and (4) Summary of PG&E - Enron Correspondence on Payment of Negative CTC.

We have also pulled together most of the primary documents (CPUC Orders, Legislation, etc.) that are discussed in this paper.  This material is quite lengthy and if anyone wants a copy, please let me know (I intend to send one to Tim Belden/Steve Swain).

If we need to hold a meeting to discuss any of this, I'll be happy to set something up for tomorrow.

Thanks,

Jim

Diann,

Your billing dispute has been reviewed and SCE has determined that all
charges were correctly calculated. New accounts were established as a
result of the change in direct access status and financial relationship and
all amounts are properly due and owing.

Please feel free to contact your Account Manager Matt Pagano should you
require assistance with regard to payment.  These bills are due and payable
and subject to further collection activity which may include Late Payment
Charges and/or reversion to dual billing if they remain unpaid.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions regarding this
matter.

Janet,

With reference to the bills listed on the attached, pursuant to Rule 22 and
Rule
10A we are disputing that any charges are properly due and owing on these
accounts.  Each of these accounts has a credit balance.  We are therefore
withholding payment.

EES seems to want to go to court on the PX Credit -- I believe we need to follow the tariff FIRST.  That involves going to the utilities and then to the CPUC if we can't work it out. If we don't do that first, the court will throw us out and make us do than anyway-- and WHY make that play -- it just raises everyone's temperature and gets them into fighting mode right off the start. Jeanne Bennett agrees with this but Laboeuf is giving EES this recommendation.

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
"free-for-all" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding --
the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

As you will read in the message below, CERA is still making some final revisions to this report regarding its figures on interest on DWR debt.  I will forward the final paper on to you as soon as I get it.  

Attached is the first version of the report - numbers in this report may not be final.

Jennifer, 
We have revised the analysis with the June 19 FERC Order, so that sum has changed. Through 2005 the figure is closer to $8 billion according to our estimates. That number includes carrying charges (at a borrowing rate of 6 percent) on total utility debt associated with buying energy in California up to this point, and past and future energy purchases by the state. 
I've seen a couple public estimates of this number other than our own but don't have the sources in hand. The state Controller Kathleen Connell has not shared the Governor's rosy views on the energy crisis and may have a realistic number out there. Let me know if you need more detail on this.
Sorry for the delayed response. I was on vacation last week.

In response to your inquiry about the availability of the paper "Short 
Circuit: Will the California Energy Crisis Derail the State's Economy?", 
currently we are updating the analysis to incorporate the effects of the 
June 19 FERC Order implementing price caps. The paper will be available 
some time next week through the CERA website. 
Please don't hesitate to call with other questions.

The Calif. EOB has released information on the size of the FERC-approved, tracked, but-as-yet-unimplemented underscheduling penalty.

See the attached PDF file, especially the figures in the attachment at the end.

The total liability for PG&E and SCE is approaching $1billion. (EOB says that DWR is off the hook but I am not sure that is true.)

As a generally balanced SC, Enron would likely be eligible for some of these proceeds.  How the proceeds would be allocated is less than fully clear.  MURRAY O'NEIL: Have you seen anything on who would receive the revenues from this tracking A/C if it were to be billed and paid?)

Also the probability of ever extracting these $s out of noncreditworthy counter parties must be taken into account.

Jeff and Jim --

I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be able
to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to October
if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far, my
research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule against
retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may subject
a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to a
methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates became
subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because the
formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to refund.
The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The change
in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very well
be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

Jeanne

It seems that since we've already contributed, we're invited.  Given where Davis' numbers have gone recently, Riordan's imminent announcement and potential, and the fact that the Rs have played it about as well as could be expected under the circumstances (save for Morrow, who we may want to bring up with Brulte if the lunch is attended, this could be a useful gathering.  And it doesn't require crossing the border into California, to boot.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is an invitation letter from Reliant's CEO Steve Letbetter to the
CEO and President's of your company/energy client.

Jim Brulte and Dave Cox asked Reliant to host a lunch for them with energy
industry executives in Houston and we will be doing do on October 29th.
Jim and Dave will be making follow up calls to the principals.  I wanted
you each to know this was happening and see the invitation.  The financial
commitment is attached to attending the lunch but the pitch will be made to
support the Senate/Assembly Leadership account at the CA Republican Party.

This invitation is only going to energy industry executives, although there
is a possibility a few other Texas companies might be included.

Expect a call from Jeff Miller encouraging you to support attending when
asked by your client/company.

Hope to see you in Houston on the 29th.

Let me make sure I understand this.  Prior to April 2002, the UDCs want the=

hey can collect from DA customers to help pay for the QFs.

Subject:        Summary or PX Credit Proposals=20


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August=
 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything. =20

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso=
ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve S=
wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is t=
o have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th. =20

Current Issues:=20
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undeterm=
ined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)

2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E =
is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)=20
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX =
clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised =
PX credits=20

4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D=20
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charg=
es), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions

6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE=20


The four proposals are as follows:=20

SCE Recommended Approach=20
        This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 1=
8, 2001 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the=
  gross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed=
.   This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no    generation/c=
ommodity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent) =
 will be applicable to Direct Access customers. =20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        1) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to=
 EES or EEMC=20
        2) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an "all=
owable claim" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if p=
ossible. =20

        3) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument=20
        4) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit =
Balances on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility=
 parent   level.=20

        5) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if=
/when an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC=20

        Other consideration:=20
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


PG&E Recommended Approach=20
        This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective Janu=
ary 18, 2001 would include an "avoided cost"  component.  This avoided cost=
 =20

        component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDW=
R purchases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchase=
s.        This resulting "avoided cost" would be used in lieu of the PX cle=
aring price in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDW=
R purchase  costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embe=
dded gen costs)  should be included in the calculation. =20

       =20
        Enron would request the following:=20
        Same as above=20

        Other Consideration:=20
        Enron  would continue to be exposed to "price" risk attributable to=
 the actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would h=
amper     Enron's ability         to hedge the positions in the retail port=
folio.=20

Hybrid Approach=20
        This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from Jan=
uary 18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is       =
  applicable from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary=
 as a compromise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposa=
l.=20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        Same as SCE and PG&E approach=20

        Other considerations:=20
        Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concer=
n re CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


Enron Model=20
        This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 a=
nd SP15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.  =20

        Enron would request the following:=20
        It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from eithe=
r PG&E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial =
is        the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   Howev=
er, understanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the=
 "value"    Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utiliti=
es and CPUC.

        Other considerations:=20
        This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge "price" risk, b=
ut this is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated wit=
h the     actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu=

I think ABAG has a good point and the principle is one we are also trying to establish - if you weren't using DWR power, you shouldn't have to pay for it.  But I wonder if Enron's endorsement of ABAG's petition wouldn't contaminate it.  I think we should let them win on the merits of their own argument and use their success (if it occurs) as precedent for our position on similar issues.

Also, there is some downside if they win.  Our customers were on the utility for those 3 months, and are now off - the direct opposite of the situation ABAG is in.  So if they escape the burden of the 3 month surcharge, it would (should) be reimposed on customers who were on the utility at that time - which in theory could include our customers, even though they are back on DA and otherwise exempt from the surcharge.

So while I think we want them to win, like always, its hard to figure if that's good or bad so let's just stay out.

Importance:	High

Attached is a petition for modification of Decision 01-05-064 (the rate
design decision) filed by the Association of Bay Area Governments. The
Petition requests that the decision be modified to exempt customers which
were direct access for the period of March through May 2001 from the 12
month procurement surcharge which is designed to allow the utilities to
collect the three cent increase authorized by the March decision which then
did not go into effect until June (i.e., collect the revenues foregone due
to the time lag in implementation).

Given the fact that most of Enron's customers were on bundled service during
the March-June time frame, I do not believe that the requested modification
would provide them any benefit. Let me know if I am wrong on this and if
Enron wants to chime in  in support of ABAG's petition.

Jim,

Attached is an updated list of customer's likely interested in supporting our regulatory and legislative DA efforts.  This is slightly updated from the list we sent week before.

Let me know if you still need help soliciting customer support.

Here's the proposal:

There is NO reason for the PUC to suspend DA since 1) 18XX passed--therefore the bonds are taken care of; all Davis has to do is sign the bill, 2) Angelides has said that money's not an issue, at least for the next several months, and 3) the Senate passed a resolution on Friday night stating that there is no reason to continue the "state of emergency" put in place by Davis on Jan. 17 and that the state of emergency should therefore end.
The PUC should therefore keep DA intact and begin putting the ratemaking in place to enable DA, while achieving other important objectives (e.g., no cost-shifting, make sure bonds get serviced, etc.)
If, however, the PUC rejects this rational, sensible proposal and decides to suspend DA, then that date must not be any earlier than Sept. 20th; and if it is, we will sue.

Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

SBX 1 (Soto/Scott) The bill passed out of the Assembly Revenue and Taxation
Committee, as amended, on a party line vote.  The bill now goes to
Appropriations.  Amendments should be available tomorrow.

SBX 78 (Polanco) - The Governor's office called a meeting earlier today of
the business community to discuss a strategy for moving SBX 78 out of
Appropriations and off of the Assembly floor.  The Governor asked that the
business community try to get support from Republicans.  Assemblyman
Leonard, who was the lone Republican to vote for the bill yesterday, is
meeting with Republicans now to try and get their support.  It is widely
held that his rationale for voting for the bill was because he was concerned
that if the bill did not get out in its current form, liberal Democrats
would have amended the bill to look more like the original bill. This is
likely the reason why they need Republicans now.  Assembly session begins at
8:30 a.m. tomorrow and Appropriations will be held off the floor.  Language
is still not available.

We will need to clarify early next week the exact status of the Second
Extraordinary Session.  Through conversations I had today, it appears as if
only the Senate adjourned the second special session and not the Assembly.
Both houses need to adjourn the second special session otherwise it runs
through November, 2002.  In referencing a Third Extraordinary Session, the
Governor likely assumed that the second special session would be adjourned.
We need to get clarification from Rules as to what this means.

Subject:	RE: CA Extenstions/Amendments

SCE and PG&E have raised these questions.  The questions came up at a meeting with the utilities on Oct 2 and again on OCt 25 -- SCE went so far as to say that in a response filed last week, I believe. The questions arise because, once you have a date cutting off direct access -- what can be allowed thereafter and what can't?  Once DA, always DA? (we say) What consitutes a written DA "contract".  (the utilities ask) You'd think the utilities would have better things to spend their time on.  Actually, SCE most likely benefits (pays off its debts sooner) if it can capture more customers. These are similar to issues Commissioner Wood is investigating and may result in a decision along those lines that goes to the Commission for a vote.  We are opposing as are 95% of the customer groups.  A pre-hearing conf is being held at 2 pm today with Wood's friendly ALJ to talk further about these type of issues.  I will keep you apprised.

I heard that the CPUC and/or the utilities have taken the position that any amendment to a contract after 9/20, like a pricing amendment, is a new contract entered after 9/20 and therefore invalid.  Is this true?  Does this hold any water?

JIm - This is a summary of our claims against PG&E.  Let me know if you
want something changed.  I believe the last slide will be the most
useful.

Gang:

The final letter and document will be given to the Speaker shortly.  As you
may know, TURN ultimately decided not to participate.  Also, late last week
the Utility Workers had an elected change of leadership and there was not
enough time to bring the new officers up to speed by our deadline.

The Speaker plans on using our product to simultaneously encourage the PUC
not to close the door on direct access and, if necessary, convince the
Legislature to pass this year a meaningful direct access program (if the PUC
goes south on us).  Also, I believe he hopes that our work will help
convince the Legislature to move to restore SCE to financial stability - and
to do so rapidly.

This last month has been very interesting to me - "oddly satisfying" is how
I described it, even if most of you did object to the phrasing - and I
appreciate the opportunity of working with you.  For whatever reasons, there
is nothing like an intractable social and political problems to get me
interested.  Thanks very much for participating.

Phil

On Sept 20, the CPUC implemented a system average 1.46 cents per kwh rate increase for bundled service customers of SDG&E.  This is an interim increase specifically designed to alow SDG&E to provide funds to DWR.  

While DA is excluded from the increase, the PUC said it will revisit that issue if it finds that any services "funded by the DWR revenue requirement ... provide any benefit to direct access customers."  

The decision does not address other surcharge amounts necessary to maintain the small customer rate ceiling or large customer rate freeze (6.5 cents), or whether DA will help fund those additional amounts.

In the case, we had argued that DA should not have to pay either type of surcharge, so, so far so good.

Folks:

We're getting down to the wire.  The Legislature has failed to come up with a solution.  The Treasuer (Angelides) has been marketing the bond issuance.  The key component of his sales pitch to investors is his guarantee that the PUC will suspend DA at its August 23rd meeting, period.  Loretta's in a box with few options other than suspension.  

Attached is a proposal that Sue and I pulled together yesterday (all defects, errors, lapses of judgment, etc., included in the proposal are mine, not Sue's).  It's got two options:

Option A
Cap DA at the net short position for the next 12 months on a first-come-first-serve basis.  "New" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt and 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present.  "New" DA customers would be exempt from DWR long-term charges, however.  "Old" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Option B
No cap on DA eligibility.  However, "New" DA customers would pay fixed charges for 1) utility past debt, 2) the bonds to cover DWR purchases from Jan to present, and 3) above-market costs of DWR contracts. "Old" DA customers would be exempt from everything.  Absent legislation addressing DA, PUC would revisit in 12 months.

Clearly, these are not "first best" DA constructs.  But the situation we face is arguably binary----DA suspended altogether, or a significantly compromised DA market, but a market, nonetheless.

Tomorrow is a meeting of the Direct Access Coaltion, where Sue and I intend to present the options and attempt to get "everyone" on board.  If successful, we would file the proposal (as a very large coaltion) with the PUC on Friday, accompanied by a noisy press release.

Please review and determine if there are defects in the options that would prevent us from going forward.

We'd like to discuss further on today's 1:30 (CDT) California call.

Best,
Jeff

Jim:
 
During the CA call today, you requested a copy of this bill and asked about its language concerning rates after March 02.
 
* This is the link to the bill: <http://info.sen.ca.gov/cgi-bin/postquery?bill_number=sbx2_78&sess=CUR&house=B&site=sen>
 
* The mechanism for setting rates is a little unclear, however, at the end of this message I have attached part of a Senate analysis of this bill that may provide you with the information you need. Please let me know if you require additional information. 
 
* FYI - Scott and I are finalizing a matrix of relevant CA legislation and will circulate it shortly for feedback.  I will keep it updated and distribute updated versions to the group on a regular basis.  I will also update the binders in the CA meeting room with the most recent versions for our reference.
 
Jennifer
 
*********************
 
          "Existing provisions of the Public Utilities Act  
          restructuring the electrical industry establish a process  
          for the recovery by electrical corporations regulated by  
          the Public Utilities Commission of uneconomic transition  
          costs for a certain period of time, and requires the  
          commission to establish a mechanism for recovery of these  
          costs.

          This bill would also provide for recovery by a specified  
          electrical corporation of qualified costs, as defined,  
          subject to verification and approval by the commission, if  
          the corporation and its holding company enter into a  
          specified binding and enforceable agreement with the state  
          for performance of various requirements including, the sale  
          to retail end-use customers of and the application of  
          cost-based rates to all electricity produced by generation  
          assets owned by the corporation, dedication of certain  
          generation output to the state, conveyance of certain lands  
          to the state, termination of actual or potential  
          litigation, agreement to resume procurement of full  
          electricity requirements for its service area as soon as it  
          is deemed creditworthy or January 1, 2003, whichever is  
          sooner, providing an irrevocable option to purchase  
          transmission facilities, and application of a specified tax  
          refund to reduction or elimination of debt.  The bill would  
          require the commission, until December 15, 2006, to approve  
          an irrevocable financing order for the recovery by the  
          electrical corporation of an electrical corporation debt  
          repayment set-aside, in an amount not to exceed  
          $2,500,000,000 of qualified costs.  The bill would require  
          the electrical corporation repayment set-aside established  
          pursuant to these provisions to be paid exclusively by  
          customers with electric loads exceeding 125 kilowatt  
          billing demand.  The bill would enact various other related  
          provisions in that regard, including authorizing the  
          issuance of electricity market stabilization bonds by the  
          electrical corporation secured by the set-aside and  
          requiring the approval of the commission of those bonds.   
          The bill would require the electrical corporation to apply  
          the net proceeds from the sale of electricity market  
          stabilization bonds to certain of the corporation's debts.

          Existing law requires the commission to identify certain  
          generation-related costs of electrical corporations that  
          are uneconomic under the restructuring of the electrical  
          industry, and provides for recovery of those uneconomic  
          costs by the corporations from customers in a specified  
          manner.

          This bill would provide that these and certain related  
          provisions are repealed on January 1, 2002.

          The Public Utilities Act provides for the continued  
          regulation by the commission of the facilities for the  
          generation of electricity owned by any public utility prior  
          to January 1, 1997, but pursuant to Chapter 2 of the  
          2001-02 First Extraordinary Session, also prohibits any  
          disposal of a facility of this nature prior to January 1,  
          2006.

          This bill would enact new provisions authorizing the  
          commission to require an electrical corporation to make  
          direct investments in generation facilities, and providing  
          for the commission to approve rates sufficient to support  
          that investment.  The bill would prohibit the commission,  
          on or before January 1, 2006, from reducing a specified  
          electrical corporation's authorized rate of return on  
          generation assets below a certain level, if the electrical  
          corporation has entered into the specified binding and  
          enforceable agreement with the state described above."

 
Existing provisions of the Public Utilities Act restructuring the electrical industry establish a process  for the recovery by electrical corporations regulated by  
          the Public Utilities Commission of uneconomic transition  
          costs for a certain period of time, and requires the  
          commission to establish a mechanism for recovery of these  
          costs.

Subject:=09EES Billing Issues

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issues--recoupment =
of the PX Credit and the $10 surcharge.  I would appreciate it if those of =
you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct=
 or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone e=
lse with an interest in this matter.

A.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the "Negative CTC")

     1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE =
are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  P=
rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills =
would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have=
 now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo=
r T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in=
 PX Credits.  The PX credit has been replaced with the PE credit, so we are=
 receiving an energy credit, just not calculated the same way as the PX.   =
This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opinion of perhaps =
three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be collected as a bi=
ll credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer, expressed his=
 strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was improper, and t=
hat we should challenge the action by making a filing with the CPUC.  Note:=
  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which accrued to prior=
 to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX Credit accrue=
d during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the proper methodol=
ogy for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Furthermore, PG&E and=
 SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the Credit that h=
ad accrued as of December 31, 2000.

    2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluatin=
g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a=
 process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust=
omers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an=
 interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equiva=
lent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an in=
junction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysi=
s is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the=
 CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluat=
ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.

    3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  I will need to c=
onfirm when late fees will begin accruing.  SCE late charges are calcuated =
at .9% of total owing.  The first disconnect notices would not be received =
until September 19.  Disconnect notices will be directed to Enron not the c=
ustomer.  PG&E will begin demanding payment before SCE.

    4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour=
t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit   to our bills has no eff=
ect on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and =
prospectively.  Both utilities are providing a credit (PE) at this time.  I=
t is their methodology we are disputing.

B.  $10 Surcharge

     1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10=
 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when ma=
de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of =
power on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases f=
or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 sur=
charge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene=
ration for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct =
access should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the C=
PUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.
Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no dir=
ect benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as =
a tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the del=
ivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not im=
pose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing ma=
de at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only. =
 SCE is NOT imposing the $10 surcharge as it is credited back to us in the =
PE credit. =20

     2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead i=
n advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to =
direct access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry g=
roup rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we wou=
ld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th=
e CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we=
 would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o=
ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success=
ful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w=
hen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi=
rst imposed.

     3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will=
 need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no=
tices.

     4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze=
 with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on=
 other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17=
, and prospectively). CTC's have not been collected since the PX prices wen=
t out of control last year.  It is the Procured Energy Credit we need to ch=
allenge.

Jim, I spoke with Mike Alexander, PG&E, last night.  Their legal team met yesterday afternoon regarding our request.   He expects we will receive a response from Peter Ouberg today or tomorrow.  They are saying that the credits are listed as part of Schedule F of their bankruptcy filing and cannot be reinstated.  Mike also commented that they do not view this as a billing dispute and will refer us to Rule 22, Section L. 2. e &f, ESP responsibilities.

Janet Covington, SCE, said their legal and credit team are crafting a response.  She did not have a feel for how SCE will view our request.  I think it might be a good time to contact Steve Kean.

Let me know if you have questions.

Talked to Fielder. He said that he agreed with us (i.e., the PUC decision supports our position) and that he would talk to Edison's DASR people.  He said that if there were any problems, etc., he'd call us on Monday.

Jeff will be talking to Fielder on this.

SCE said at our meeting Monday that they DID NOT want to talk about these issues at the PHC -- they wanted to address it through the advice letters. This one shouldn't even be up an issue at all.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access
service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern
California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,
2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject
to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your
DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or
verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit
the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.

The CEOs you contact may not know who their representatives are on the CMTA board, especially if the company is based outside California.  Word should be sent down from the top to these folks that direct access should be elevated within CMTA, as well as within other associations they belong to.
 
Key names at CMTA among the companies we discussed:
 
Marsha Kwalwasser, Northrup Grumman -- She's on the CMTA executive committee.  Her title is not listed.
 
Edward Munoz,  Raytheon, is a board member.  He is listed in the lobbyist directory as "regional director," with a contact number of (310) 847-6531.
 
Michael Jackson represents Boeing on the CMTA board.  His title and contact number are not listed.
 
FYI, Steve Chaudet from Lockheed Martin also sits on the executive committee.

Subject: Update on the Implementation of the Suspension of Direct Access


Below is a summary of the events which have been occurring since last week's
meeting between the UDCs and ESPs re the implementation of the suspension of
direct access:

1. On October 3rd, a small working group comprised of representatives of the
three UDCs, Enron, Commonwealth and UC/CSU had a conference call to discuss
the filing of a joint proposal on the numerous issues surrounding the
implementation of the suspension of direct access.  While SCE was
represented on the call, it was clear that they were not interested in a
joint proposal and would file their own plan.  On the call, drafting
assignments were divvied up and another call was scheduled for Tuesday the
9th.

2.  On October 4h (as directed by the decision suspending DA), the UDCs
submitted letters to the Energy Division on their progress in implementing
the suspension.  PG&E and SDG&E submitted a joint letter which basically set
forth what they had done to date and their progress of working with the
ESPs.  They stated that they anticipated filing a joint proposal with the
ESPs soon.  SCE, however, was more specific in its submission.  Therein, SCE
states that "SCE will not accept connect DASRs after October 20, 2001." The
submittal also states that "SCE will not process connect DASRs for service
accounts which did not exist on September 20, 2001."

3. On October 9th, a conference call was held between SDG&E, PG&E, Enron,
Commonwealth, NewWest and UC/CSU.  At that time, SDG&E and PG&E informed the
ESPs that they would not be able to file a joint proposal.  That, instead,
they would be filing an advice letter (probably joint between the two UDCs)
which proposed a connect DASR cut off date. While a definitive date was not
stated, they indicated that it would be around the end of the year.

4. PG&E and SDG&E stated that they would file such advice letters by the end
of the week.  Parties would have approximately 10 days to respond.

Follow-up on Monday California conference call, regarding passthrough of the 1 cent surcharge.

SCE:

Does NOT appear to be passing through the 1 cent surcharge to Direct Access.  

In a letter to the PUC's Energy Division on June 19, SCE said:  "By incorporating both the 1 and 3 cent per kWh surcharges into the generation component of total rates in Advice 1545-E, SCE has effectively exempted DA customers from these surcharges by including them in the new DA credit. ..  SCE, however, is not entirely sure whether the Commission intends to exempt the DA customers from the 1 cent per kWh surcharge and has previously requested Energy Division's opinion on this matter."

This letter was responding to a request by AReM for clarification of this very issue.  In a prior Advice Letter 1529-E, of April 5, SCE seemed to say that the generation rate (that forms the basis of the PX credit) does not include the 1 cent surcharge.   

So, SCE seems to think the PUC has been unclear about whether the 1 cent surcharge applies to Direct Access, and as a result is not billing it to Direct Access.  This is in spite of the PUC's January 4 order, where it said "All other customers, including direct access customers, are subject to this surcharge." (p. 21)  

Of course, it is not at all clear what SCE will do if the PUC clarifies for SCE that they could have been billing the surcharge to Direct Access customers.

PG&E:

Is passing through the 1 cent surcharge to Direct Access.  PG&E's Advice Letter 2119-E, of May 22, clearly exemps Direct Access from the 3 cent surcharge only.

Where are the $$ from the surcharges going?

March 27 PUC Order of Commissioner Lynch:

"PG&E and Edison shall enter the revenues from the rate increases into balancing accounts and the revenues shall be subject to refund if, at a later date, we determine that the utilities failed to use the funds to pay for future power purchases.  The revenues the utilities have collected and continue to collect from the one-cent per kilowatt-hour rate increase authorized on January 4, 2001 shall be used to pay for power purchases and not for any other costs incurred by the utilities. " (p. 55)

"It is reasonable that a certain amount of the revenues from the rate increases will be provided to DWR for its power costs, once DWR provides us with its revenue requirement. " (p. 51)

So, the utilities have been directed to hold the money from the surcharges in balancing accounts pending the PUC's acceptance of DWR's revenue requirement.  

Call me with any questions.

Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.

A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be "equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.

Subject: Re: Retroactive Suspension - SDG&E's message


It would be surprising if the Commission did what SDG&E is suggesting.  From a strictly legal perspective, it is unlikely that the Commission would vote to suspend direct access retroactively.  Although an argument could be put forward that the Commission has the authority to do so, such an act could be challenged on U.S. Constitutional grounds as being violative of the Contracts Clause.  Moreover, from a practical perspective, retroactive suspension would be politically unpalatable and cause a good deal of protest from affected parties.  However, the Commission might choose to so regardless of these factors, due to political pressure from Sacramento to ensure the saleability of the power revenue bonds.
 
The Commission has frequently reserved to itself the power to modify existing contracts, particularly those entered into by utilities subject to its jurisdiction.  It has exercised this right often, using as justification wording contained in utility contracts that make the agreements subject to the Commission's continuing jurisdiction, including such modifications as it may direct.  For example, the standard ESP Service Agreement used by all three of the state's electric utilities provides that, "This Agreement may be subject to such changes or modifications as the CPUC may from time to time direct or necessitate in the exercise of its jurisdiction, and the Parties may amend the Agreement to conform to changes directed or necessitated by the CPUC."  This phraseology is typically referred to by the state's utilities as a "regulatory out" clause.  
 
However, this sort of wording has not been required to be included in the contracts entered into by ESPs, as the Commission does not regulate these entities.  ESPs that plan to offer electric services to residential and small commercial customers must fulfill certain registration requirements, as adopted by the Commission in Decisions (D.) 99-05-034 and D.98-03-072 in accordance with Public Utilities Code Section 394(b).  However, ESPs who serve larger customers are not even subject to this registration requirement.  Most importantly, ESP terms and conditions of service are not subject to regulation by the Commission.  Therefore, the regulatory out language cited above is not customarily included in standard contracts signed between ESPs and their customers.
 
The absence of a regulatory out clause would make Commission efforts to modify retroactively contracts entered into between ESPs and their customers extremely suspect.  This is due to the fact that such action could be seen as violative of Section 10 of Article I of the United States Constitution.  It provides in part that, "No State shall . . .  pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts . . ." [Emphasis added] 
 
Under the Supreme Court's Contracts Clause jurisprudence, the threshold inquiry is, "whether the state law has, in fact, operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship."  Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, 438 U.S. 234, 244 (1978).  "This inquiry has three components:  whether there is a contractual relationship, whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and whether the impairment is substantial."  General Motors Corporation v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 186 (1992).
 
The Contracts Clause only applies to contracts that exist at the time of the law's passage.  Also, the Contracts Clause has been deemed to apply both to legislation or other government action, but not to court decisions.  The judiciary has the power to invalidate a contract without violating the Contracts Clause.  See Tidal Oil v. Flanagan, 263 U.S. 444 (1924).  In a case involving a private contract, the law or governmental action must substantially impair a pre-existing contractual relationship.  Once this hurdle is met, the government must demonstrate that the law imposes reasonable conditions appropriate to achieving a significant and legitimate public purpose.  Often, when faced with such an issue, the courts defer to the legislative judgment.  However, this does not prevent an independent investigation of the relevant factual situation.

This is probably far more than you wanted to know.....just wanted to give a quick overview on the subject.  Bottom line:  CPUC would be dumb to suspend retroactively, at least from a legal perspective.  On the other hand, when has brilliance been a hallmark of recent decisions from this Commission?

Dan,  I need your help to make sure we get the appropriate evidence of these receivables into the record, so as to offset refunds deemed to be due (if any, after netting purchases and sales).  As you will recall, we submitted some documentation of the $40MM receivable to Judge Wagner.  I expect that we will have to provide quite a bit (more) detail regarding this and the other receivables.  Also, who do you suggest for a witness on this, or will affidavits be sufficient?  Need your input on this, since we may have to do additional research and now is the time to do it before the August 13 prehearing conference.  Thanks!  Ray

Subject:	California Refund Proceeding
Privileged and Confidential
Attorney Work Product
Attorney-Client Communication

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

Subject: CPUC/Supreme Court Petition


Attached is the final draft of the Petition for your review and comment.
 
Please provide your comments no later than noon PST on November 8, 2001.
 
There are several changes, all of which are cosmetic.  In summary:
    1.  Douglass has been added as an attorney of record so it is not necessary to obtain substitutions.  Instead, we will file an association of counsel which does not have to be signed by the party.
    2.  The Rules of Court are unclear regarding page length.  Since one set of rules could limit the length to 30 pages, I decided to stay within that limit.  This was done by restructuring the pleading, reducing the lines to 1.5 rather than 2 spaces, and editing.  
    3.  There has been no sacrifice of substance.  In fact, I added the nine factual questions enumerated by Bilas to show why hearings were necessary.
 
Tomorrow we will complete the Exhibit Folio and Motion for the Supreme Court to judicially notice certain exhibits:  rhe January 17 Proclamation by Davis, Resolution No. 46 and the Preferred Policy Decision.  We will also insert the page references for the exhibits.
 
Everything will be delivered to the copy service at noon to make the required copies for filing and service and to bind the pleadings.  It is my intent to file the Petition, Exhibit Folio, and Motion on Friday morning, have the CPUC personally served and every other party served by mail on Friday.  EWD

?	We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
?	Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down; 
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection. 
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
?	Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
?	In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
?	We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
?	We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
?	We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

This filing strongly endorses the GridSouth Market Monitoring Plan in lieu of the non-plan filed by WestConnect?  Are we OK with that?

Dave or Christi--Can you send me or point me to the GridSouth MM Plan?  Thanks,

Ray or Dave, can you make the Wed  EPSA call where this filing will be discussed?

Jim,

I was not aware EPSA was filing an intervention to the WestConnect tariff.  After a cursory review of the attachment however, it very much lines up with what I have sent to Ray and Steve.  We focus a bit more on the lack of definition of a congestion management plan as well as hit on "hints" of where WestConnect is probably going to stay (contract path) based upon some clues in the filing.  We focus more on existing contracts (lack of conversion) as well as additional comments on the planning appendix.  They hit just about every other point we cover, independence, or lack thereof being the key.

Thanks,

Dave

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
      Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
           Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
           Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy
           Erin Perrigo, Manager of Policy

DATE: November 12, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Motion to Intervene and Protest in the
      WestConnect RTO filing
?			Filing due November 15th
?
Attached is EPSA's motion to intervene and protest in the WestConnect RTO filing (Docket Nos. EL02-9-000 and RT02-1-000).  The draft primarily focuses on independence and governance issues, however also highlights the WestConnect tariff, congestion management, market monitoring, pricing and interconnection aspects of the filing.  For example, the draft argues that the participating transmission owners retain too much authority over RTO operations, that FERC should require all RTO load to take service under the WestConnect tariff, and that WestConnect should adopt the GridFlorida market monitoring plan.

Interventions are due to FERC on Thursday, November 15th.  Please have any edits or comments to Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org by noon on Wednesday, November 14th.   We'll also discuss the draft on this week's Regulatory Affairs conference call on Wednesday, November 14th, at 3:30 P.M. (EST).  To access the call, dial 1-800-937-6563.  Ask for the Julie Simon/EPSA Call.  If you have further questions or comments, please contact Erin Perrigo at eperrigo@epsa.org or 202-628-8200.

Attached is the CA rate exposure model we discussed with you last week in Houston.  
 
Per our discussion, we are assuming you have numbers for CTCs in another model and thus, have left space in the model for this data.
 
Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
Also, we would appreciate if you could send us the CTC numbers once you get them.
 
Thanks,

On July 16th, SDG&E filed a Motion requesting certain actions from the
Commission necessary to implement its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR.

There are ten CPUC Implementing Decisions provided for in the MOU.  The
motion either requests that the action occur or references another CPUC
proceeding where the matter is pending.

Please let me know if Enron is interested in pursuing any matters related to
the SDG&E MOU.

Harry and Jim,

I am back from vacation and am trying to get caught up. I understand that pretty much everything (both the Direct Access vote and the PX credit language)  at the CPUC has been postponed.  I wanted to make sure you and Jim stay in the loop re the calculations (as best as we can make) estimating the difference between Enron's recommended market rates vs. the utilities interim methodology for PX credits.  

Please read the e-mail below and call if you would like to discuss.

Subject:	PX Credits - PG&E, SCE Calculation after Jan 18

Michael - As a follow-up to our meeting several weeks ago, I have performed a rough calculation of the impact of PG&E and SCE's px calculation after Jan 18 as follows:

PG&E  $24.9MM
SCE     $34.6MM 

As we discussed, this would be incremental receivables from the utility if the CPUC agreed that the utilitities should have been using NP 15 and SP 15 rates for calculating PX credits.  Let me know if you'd like me to schedule a meeting to review these calculations and discuss next steps.  Thanks.

Harry/Sue:

Have you looked at the places in 82XX that Scott FedEx-ed to you that implicate the "PX credit?"  I've gotta assume that Edison put it in, and I frankly, ain't had the chance to peek at it.  For that reason, I'm worried.  Can you page me and let me know your take?

Best,
Jeff

Sue, let's you, Mike, and I talk to Ed Duncan about revising the Brief.  I don't think it matters that a draft went to some customers.

Bob,
AS you can see from the e-mail I sent you, I believe it has aleady been circulated to customers -- by today, if not yesterday. This is the same draft that you received from me on Monday. Bob, we have to move fast -- we have to be prepared to file within a few hours of any CPUC action.  Believe me, chaos will begin if the CPUC votes for retroactive DA suspension

Others,
Given Bob's request, please do not circulate to any more of our customers until further notice.

Sue, there are some statements in the brief that would be contrary to positions we would take in arbitration on ouu unwind rights.  For now, please don't circulate to any customers.  I will take a look at the language more closely.

Importance:	High


As of this point in time, the CPUC is NOT expected to vote tomorrow. The CPUC has not said when a new meeting would be held.  Although we continue to keep the pressure on, the CPUC vote could be for DA suspension as of July 1.  We need to be prepared to take immediate legal action in that event.  Here is the plan and what we'd like from customers.

Within a few hours of a CPUC vote, we plan to file at the CPUC for an emergency stay and request for rehearing. As part of that filing, we would need to include all of  the points we would raise in the court and declarations from each individual aggrieved party.   The decalarations would be held completely confidential by the attorney, transmitted directly through our outside attorney and would be filed under protective seal at the Commission.  The attorneys are preparing a pro-forma declaration that each party can use to prepare their own. I will e-mail that as soon as I have it. The draft court case is attached.  It will form the basis for our CPUC filing.
We would expect the CPUC to ignore the filing.  If the Commission failed to act on our request by the next regularly scheduled meeting, we would file in court immediately. We would use the same declarations and much of the same filing info in the court case.
To the extent we have customers on our filings, we have a much better shot at winning. I have gotten agreements form a number of other ESPs who will join with us.  They are: APSES, Strategic Energy, AES/New Energy, American Utility Network, and perhaps Commonwealth. Each of these, in turn, is working to get some of their customers to sign on. I am working with UC's attorney to see if they will join.
Our strategy is similar if the Legislature enacts a law with a retroactive date.  The major differences are that we would go directly to court and we would have to wait until the bill was signed by the Governor. Some of our ESP and customer friends would likely drop off at that point, because they have less financial harm from an Aug 25 date.
If you have customers intersted in signing on, please let me know.  The customer may contact me or the attorneys directly.  Here is contact info:

Rush to beat direct-access purchase ban spurs fear
By Ed Mendel 
STAFF WRITER 
September 12, 2001 
SACRAMENTO -- Some utility customers, mainly businesses, are rushing to sign
contracts with generators for cheaper power before regulators enact a
long-delayed ban, raising concern that costs may go up for the remaining
customers. 
The state plans to ban "direct access" contracts with generators to keep
customers with utilities in order to help pay for power bought by the state
since January. Those state purchases will be covered in part by a $12.5
billion bond paid off by ratepayers over 15 years. 
But many businesses, which say they need cheaper power now to remain
competitive, are signing contracts to bypass the utilities before the Public
Utilities Commission bans direct-access pacts, an action that could come as
soon as tomorrow. 
"We have seen a significant increase in the last month," said Ed Van Herik,
a spokesman for San Diego Gas & Electric Co. 
He said the amount of the annual SDG&E power load shifted to direct-access
contracts with generators increased from 10 percent at the end of July to
17.4 percent at the end of last month. 
Allowing customers to shop around for cheaper power was the main promise of
the state's failed attempt to deregulate electricity. But when the utilities
ran up huge debts and could no longer borrow, the state began buying power
for utility customers in January. 
To avoid harming the economy with a massive rate increase, the state decided
to spread out payment of the soaring cost of wholesale power by obtaining
decade-long power contracts and issuing the $12.5 billion ratepayer bond. 
Now the state wants customers to remain with the utilities for two reasons:
paying their fair share of the state-subsidized power received earlier this
year and preserving a ratepayer base large enough to pay off the long-term
contracts and the bond. 
The power provided by the state to utility customers looked like a bargain
earlier this year, when prices on the wholesale market skyrocketed while the
state raised rates for the customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and
Southern California Edison by about one-third. 
The state has not raised rates for SDG&E customers. But an increase
averaging 12 percent for SDG&E residential customers is on the PUC agenda
tomorrow, along with several other actions that may be taken to pave the way
for issuing the $12.5 billion ratepayer bond. 
PUC President Loretta Lynch said that before wholesale power prices began
soaring last year, about 16 percent of the power provided by the three
investor-owned utilities was being bought through direct-access contracts.
By last March, she said, the amount dropped to 1 percent. 
"Certainly, the direct access tanked because the marketers dumped their
customers back on the utilities when the price rose last year," Lynch said. 
But as wholesale power prices dropped in June, direct-access contracts began
to look like a better deal, and a number of customers have left the
utilities to get cheaper power. 
At Southern California Edison, the number of customers with direct-access
contracts grew from 32,547 on June 21 to 37,718 by the end of last month --
an increase of 5,171, said Steve Hansen, an Edison spokesman. 
"Now that the market has turned, everyone is bailing as fast as they can,"
said Mike Florio of The Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco-based
consumer group. 
Most of the electricity obtained through direct-access contracts in recent
months apparently has been bought by businesses that use large amounts of
electricity. 
"Most of the providers which serve small customers have simply stopped doing
business in the state," said PUC Commissioner Carl Wood, who with Lynch
outlined the PUC's proposed actions at a Capitol news conference late last
month. 
The PUC delayed action to ban direct-access contracts, waiting for the
Legislature to act on proposals that would have allowed businesses to bypass
the utilities if they paid an "exit fee" to cover their share of
state-subsidized power. 
The ban on direct-access contracts originally proposed by the PUC would have
been retroactive to July 1. But the retroactive provision was reportedly
dropped after a lawsuit was threatened by the Alliance for Retail Energy
Markets, a group of power marketers. 
In the Legislature, a provision allowing utility customers to obtain
direct-access contracts beginning in 2003, if they pay exit fees, was added
to the Assembly version of a plan passed last week to keep Edison from
joining PG&E in bankruptcy. 
The addition of the direct-access provision is one reason that the Assembly
version of the Edison plan is supported by the California Chamber of
Commerce. But the Assembly plan pushed by Gov. Gray Davis faces opposition
in the Senate. 
Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the Senate
would send an Edison bill back to the Assembly after making it a
"less-egregious giveaway" to the utility. 
The main provision in the Assembly plan would allow Edison to eliminate most
of its debt by issuing $2.9 billion in bonds that would be paid off by
ratepayers. 
The Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights, a consumer group in Santa
Monica, calls the Edison plan a "bailout" and is threatening to place a
measure on the ballot that would ask voters to overturn the plan should it
be approved by the Legislature and governor. 
And TURN, the San Francisco consumer group, says the Assembly version of the
Edison rescue plan is more generous to the utility than a tougher plan
approved by the Senate in July and giving Edison an additional $1.8 billion.

The consumer group also says the direct-access provision in the Assembly's
Edison plan has "major loopholes" that would allow large customers to leave
the utilities without paying their fair share of state power costs. 
"TURN opposes the reintroduction of direct access, because any 'savings'
that are claimed to occur are really nothing more than the result of cost
shifting to those who do not or cannot abandon utility service," the
consumer group said in a statement.

The FERC order appears to be putting a significant crimp on the  real time (R/T) desk of Enron and other marketers whenever market prices are at or near the cap.  The initial west wide cap is approx $108 an we hit that today in R/T. Briefly:

Marketers cannot sell above the cap.  So when prices reach the cap, generators are on their own to find buyers. (Generators can sell above the cap; if the generator is thermal they simply make a end-of-month cost filing.)  Marketers which provide an important function of making the market and providing transmission are simply shut out.

Even if a marketer makes a deal below the cap, the deal could be cut due to transmission problems.  Should the cost of replacement power exceed the cap (which can easily happen), the marketer may be left holding the bag because, again, the marketer cannot sell above the cap. 

When CAISO declares an emergency, the cap will change hourly.  R/T deals are usually done several hours out.   A marketer will essentially have no idea what the relevant cap will be when it is making its deal.

Cash markets can also face all these same problems.  However, the cash desks may be able to sell more than 24 hours out. 

Because these impacts are disproportionate on marketers, we should consider an appeal of this order separate from EPSA.

On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs.

It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.  The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do). After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action.

Most agreed on the following plan (with the CPUC staff to check on the appropriate procedural vehicle):
We will endeavor to reach agreement on a joint filing at the CPUC to modify Rule 22 (the rule that governs CPUC/ESP interactions) (a Petition to Modify was also discussed as a vehicle) - a small working group of attorneys has been set up to draft this.  The group includes Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich, who represents UC/CSU.
The new Rule 22 will add a section that acknowledges the CPUC action and sets forth therein (or in an Appendix) a verification procedure.
Each ESP will submit a list of customers by this Friday, October 5, for ALL contracts -- existing and new -- to each utility. It will be diificult and perhaps impossible to add customers later, so be complete.
Each ESP will submit to each utility the account level information for each customer on the list by November 1. All customer accounts should be on this list including facilities that have not yet been switched to DA, but may be switched sometime in the future.  Also, to the extent customers have plans for new facilities, put them on the list -- even if we do not yet have account information. Anyone who has the right to add DA later needs to be on the list.
Any DASR submitted for an account on the November 1 list will be accepted by the utilities -- no matter when it is submitted.
Additional accounts not on the November 1 list can be added through a verification process, such as an affidavit submitted by the ESP or by both the ESP and the customer.  This process is being worked out by the attorney working group.
The CPUC will be asked to approve this approach quickly.  

There is risk that the CPUC will NOT approve the approach and will cutoff DASRs on some date certain, in which case legal action would be required to allow for futher submission of DASRs. Steve Roskow of CPUC Energy Division said the CPUC has two factions -- one wants to cut off DA and the other wants it to continue.  He could not guarantee how the CPUC will respond to the joint approach.  He also mentioned that there are many lawyers at the CPUC looking at the retoactivity issue and the Commission's ability to affect existing contracts. Several participants, including Enron, UC/CSU and APSES, made strong statements about the legal problems the CPUC would face if they go down that road.

The utilities will be making a filing at the CPUC tomorrow that describes the steps they have taken to enforce the order.  PG&E and SDG&E will discuss the meeting and the joint plan -- PG&E may also say it will stick with some DASR cutoff date unless it hears otherwise from the CPUC.  SCE did not attend the meeting in person and at the end made clear that they had not agreed with the joint plan.  SCE is sticking with its original plan -- a customer and account list by September 24 and a DASR cutoff of October 20, no DASR accepted unless the name is on the customer list. The Energy Division staff is trying to move SCE off this position but I believe it comes from "on high."  We'll take our own run at it through a higher level at SCE. For now, we should continue to submit DASRs and follow the proposed joint plan and just keep records of our interactions with SCE (and the other utilities as well). If the situation does not improve in the next few days, we will reassess.

There is also the risk that the CPUC will not act on the joint approach quickly, leaving these issues in limbo and the utilities assuming "risk" that they have done the wrong thing and will be "punished." Not surprisingly, the utilities seem to favor a drop dead date for DASR submission, as a way to minimize this risk.  During the course of the meeting, the utilities mentioned a "compromise" of January 1, 2002 for a DASR cutff date.  They thought this would give the CPUC time to act on the joint plan, but allow them to minimize their risk in the event the CPUC decides that the utilities should have cutoff DASRs from the beginning.  This notion may appear in the filings to be made tomorrow.  I told them that any drop-dead date for DASR submission would be unacceptable to Enron. UC/CSU said the same.  A few ESPs seemed ready to accept the 1/1/02 cutoff but most do not.

Call with any questions.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE August 21, 2001 CONTACT: PG&E News Department (415) 9=
73-5930   PG&E Asks Court to Require DWR to Hold a Public Hearing Before Ch=
arging $13 Billion in Power Contract Costs to California Consumers  San Fra=
ncisco - Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced it is asking the =
Sacramento Superior Court to require the Department of Water Resources (DWR=
) to abide by state law and hold a public hearing before determining whethe=
r its $13 billion in power purchase contract costs are just and reasonable =
and should be charged to electric retail ratepayers. "There is evidence tha=
t DWR is attempting to overcharge electric customers in PG&E's service area=
 by over $1.4 billion in 2001 and 2002 alone, but DWR is refusing to hold a=
 hearing on whether its costs are reasonable and supportable," said Roger P=
eters, Pacific Gas and Electric Company's senior vice president and general=
 counsel. "DWR should not be given a blank check to pay for its high-priced=
 power contracts. The public needs to be able to review DWR's contracts and=
 hold them accountable for the billions of dollars they are spending."  Bas=
ed on limited information provided by DWR, PG&E's analysis indicates that D=
WR has padded its revenue requirement for 2001-2002 by more than $3 billion=
 due to overestimating the cost for spot power purchases and natural gas. A=
s a result, PG&E's customers would overpay over $1.4 billion in the next tw=
o years alone.  DWR determined that its revenue requirement was just and re=
asonable without providing any type of prior notice and without conducting =
a full and complete public review of its costs or revenue requirement.  Und=
er the California Administrative Procedure Act, Water Code, Public Utilitie=
s Code, and the due process clauses of the federal and state constitutions,=
 DWR must hold a hearing to allow utility customers, consumer groups and al=
l other interested parties an opportunity to comment on the justness and re=
asonableness of their revenue demands. DWR's determination of its revenue r=
equirement must then be based on those comments and the overall evidence in=
 the record. Ultimately at stake are $68 billion of costs to utility custom=
ers over the next ten years under DWR contracts which have never been revie=
wed in a public hearing. This works out to an average of $6,800 for each of=
 the 10 million electric customers within the service areas of PG&E, Edison=
 and SDG&E. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, along with consumer groups an=
d other utility companies, has urged that DWR's revenue requirement receive=
 the appropriate level of public comment and review prior to adoption and i=
nclusion in rates. DWR has repeatedly refused the requests for additional i=
nformation and public hearings, saying it is exempt from any review by the =
public or the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) regarding the b=
asis or reasonableness of its request or costs.  The petition filed today r=
equests the court to order DWR to withdraw its determination that its reven=
ue requirement is just and reasonable until it complies with federal and st=
ate laws and holds a public hearing to determine if their power costs are "=
just and reasonable."  Pacific Gas and Electric Company understands the imp=
ortance of selling the revenue bonds and continues to want to work with all=
 parties to find a comprehensive solution.=09

In response to the Commission's suspension of DA, numerous market participants--including Enron--filed "Petitions for Rehearing."
The California PUC has issued a decision denying the petitions.
Many of those participants are likely to file for appellate court review of the Commission's denial.
In its decision denying the Petitions, the Commission did however modify its initial decision in several respects.
Key among those is a modification regarding facility adds.  
Those comments refer to the ability to continue to submit DASRs for new facilities under contracts signed prior to September 20th that provide for facility adds.
The Commission agreed and has ordered the utilities to accept DASRs for facility adds under contract terms executed prior to 10.20.01.  The precise language is cited below.
If you would like a copy of the decision, please contact Joseph Alamo.

Best,
Jeff

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20th, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service.  Thus, for example, with respect to the specific ESP contract described by UC/CSU in their rehearing application, the utilities are required to accept, even after September 20, 2001, any DASRs they receive that legitimatley relate to that contract...[W]e want to make it clear that...utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts executed on or before September 20, 2001."  pp 20-21

Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

All,
I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

I received a call late today from the CPUC (Joyce @ 415-703-2199).  Someone from Pac Tel called and said that his service was switched without authorization - Mike Benson with Payphone group @707-253-8892 or 707-292-1766.

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

FYI.  This is the bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR contracts (recall that the argument to end DA by the Gov's finance folks, the bond folks, and Angelides, the Treasurer stems directly from this linkage).  

Though Hertzberg was initially a supporter, his legal consultant has been scared off by the Gov's people (i.e., to de-link would "impair" the contracts, triggering breach, liquidated damages and the end of Western Civilization as we know it).  The Senate ain't buying that line.

As a result, it's now a Senate play, but they need Republicans to get the 2/3's necessary for passage, which ain't likely to be easy.  We urging Brulte to go along, but only  in exchange for deleting the "no DA" language in AB1X and for legislative language assuring that DA will continue.

Best,
Jeff

bill language was formerly associated with ABX2 10 (Hertzberg).  The bill
could be heard by the Senate Energy Committee as early as today however as
of this moment it is still not on calendar.

Will do.  P.S.  Mike Florio informs me that the order from the 9th Circuit
requires TURN to file papers with the District Court judge justifying their
request for a permanent stay within 5 days.  Following a hearing at some
unspecified time, the District Court judge will rule on that request.  If,
as expected, he denies the stay, TURN will get one more bit at the apple by
appealing that order to the 9th Circuit.  Needless to say, these
developments could deny Edison certainty regarding their precious settlement
for 2-6 months.  Mike Day

This story reflects fairly well the debate underway regarding the DA suspension date.
The Treasurer, Angelides, is taking a hard line.  We are working with others to get the date pushed back.
California PUC staff has started calling around trying to estimate how many customers have very recently switched or are trying to.  They have made inquiries to our customers, including UC/CSU.

State fights 6,000 firms' energy deals 
Discount power contracts deemed unfair to consumers 
Bernadette Tansey, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:btansey@sfchronicle.com>
Sunday, September 2, 2001 
?2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright> 
URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/09/02/MN155174.DTL>
Thousands of California businesses may reap cost breaks on electricity while other utility customers live with record rate hikes if the state lets stand a spurt of last-minute contracts with private power suppliers. 
More than 6,000 firms, including big retail chains and industrial plants, signed discounted power contracts in July and August as market prices dropped. 
State officials are incensed, saying the private "direct access" contracts with electricity providers could shift the burden for millions of dollars in state power purchases onto households and small businesses. 
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said the same companies that benefited as the state depleted its budget surplus to keep the lights on now want to escape paying their share of the billions spent to ensure power supplies for California. 
"I think it's wrong and it's immoral," Angelides said. 
State officials argue that the summer contracts can still be canceled retroactively because California businesses were on notice that their option to shop around for better deals on electricity was about to be suspended by the state Public Utilities Commission. The PUC is set to consider the retroactive ban Thursday. But energy firms say the summer deals were perfectly legal because the PUC had not yet taken action and made a series of draft decisions that put off the effective date of the direct access ban until as late as yesterday. 
"The drafts were not consistent," said Tracy Fairchild, a spokeswoman for Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, a consortium of generators and energy suppliers. "Which one were we supposed to take seriously?" 
The energy trade group is threatening to sue to protect the summer contracts. Angelides fears that a prolonged court fight could block a $12.5 billion state bond sale to reimburse the treasury for California's emergency power purchases. 
The burgeoning conflict is part of a continuing fight by energy firms and some of their business customers to preserve direct access -- a core provision of the state's 1996 deregulation law. 
Deregulation supporters predicted energy consumers would enjoy lower prices if private generators were allowed to compete with the utilities as power suppliers. But the direct access program was thrown into disarray last year when wholesale electricity prices skyrocketed and the state stepped in to buy power. 
To make sure the state's outlay would be paid back by all ratepayers, the Legislature in January directed the PUC to suspend direct access. By that time, 
most direct access customers were fleeing back to the utilities to benefit from a rate cap that protected them from the soaring market power prices. 
The PUC postponed action on the direct access ban while some legislators were sponsoring bills that would have allowed the program to continue under certain conditions. 
But by July, market prices had come down, and energy providers like Enron Energy Services, AES New Energy and Strategic Energy were again offering direct access contracts. 
Businesses were looking for relief from the record rate hikes imposed on utility customers in June, said Phoenix energy consultant Gina Coleman. Coleman said she helped five retail chains with "a significant number" of stores in California negotiate contracts with Strategic Energy this summer. 
"Business is business, and if you can get a better price for something, you should," said Coleman, who declined to name her clients. She said the lower costs will help the stores keep doing business in California and hold their prices down. 
Daniel Douglass, an attorney for the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets, said any attempt by the state to cancel contracts retroactively would violate the constitutional law. He said energy firms have purchased power to serve their customers under the contracts and would suffer losses if they were canceled. 
Angelides said the same firms that ran to the state for protection when their market contracts became too expensive now want to take advantage of lower power prices he attributes to the stabilizing effect of the state's long- term power contracts. 
"You can't take advantage of the state's stabilizing the rates, then say, 'Thank you very much,' and stick everyone else with the bill," Angelides said. 
State officials have not tallied the total number of customers who signed up in July and August, nor have they estimated the revenue loss that would have to be covered by remaining utility ratepayers. 
Figures compiled by the PUC show that commercial and industrial firms signed more than 6,000 new direct access contracts in July alone. A rough calculation suggests that, as a result, the firms might contribute as much as $64 million less annually to the repayment of state costs. 
The loss might not be significant enough to risk a court fight that would delay the bond sale, state officials said. 
Bu Angelides said the same power firms that helped create the energy crisis by charging exorbitant rates are now threatening a bond issue desperately needed to restore funds needed for education, health care and children's services. 
"What they're talking about doing," he said, "is holding us hostage until they get what they want."

OK Matt,

You're answer ignores the very direct order by the CPUC that specifically prohibits you from setting this type of deadline.  What am I missing?  Please explain your rationale for violating a specific order of the CPUC.

By the way, it was interesting to learn that you now want to discuss this at the PHC.  At our meeting Monday (10/29), the utilities (including Edison) were quite firm that they did not want to address these issues in the PHC, but wanted to complete the Advice Letter process.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

Diann,

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a
certified
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on
10/5/01
@ 3:58pm (attached below) as your certified list.

We have attached the template below to use for your convenience.


(See attached file: DA Cust List Template.xls)

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.



Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access
service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern
California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,
2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject
to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your
DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or
verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit
the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.

Jim, I spoke with Janet Covington, SCE, and Calvin Yee, PG&E today.   My request has been escalated to both UDC's legal and credit departments.  SCE should have a response to us by the end of the week.  PG&E will probably not respond until next week unless I request a more immediate response.  Should I push them?

Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.  

Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding this request.   Page me if you need to.  888.740.8480.

Thanks.

Q. What is the most likely approved methodology for calculating the PX credit after Jan 18?

A.  The utility's weighted average acquisition cost, excluding DWR.  Will include retained generation, ISO purchases, QF purchases.  Will exclude DWR because these were not purchases made by the utility.

Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order the utilities to implement the post-January 18 PX credit methodology by re-billing rather than prospective adjustments?

A.  Credits are likely to be calculated on a customer specific basis and applied to future billings for that customer.  

Q. Will the PUC allow PG&E and SCE to modify the historic PX credit calculations (from Oct 2000 through June 2001) based on the FERC refund decision for California energy markets?

A. Yes.  Agree with Sue's comments. Implementation should be same as above question.

Q.  What is the likelihood that the CPUC will order PG&E and SCE to reinstate Enron's outstanding Net Bill amounts if the utilities fail to?  And, will the CPUC order PG&E and SCE to allow this Net Bill amount to be applied against future payments for T&D?

A. Credits will be re-instated but on a customer by customer basis.  In other words, the credit shows up on a customer's bill, not some Enron bill.

Q. What is the likelihood that the CPUC will modify its application of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (a) retroactive to January 4, 2001 or (b) retroactive to March 27, 2001 or (c) prospectively?

A.  Very low.  At best, PUC makes the change retroactive to June 1, which is when the 3 cent surcharge was billed.  If the PUC reversed itself, most likely would be prospective.

All, I finally got an answer from PG&E concerning the residential customer who had an amount transferred to his utility bill after he was switched from direct access.  PG&E admits that they transferred accumulated credit balances off of the residential accounts BEFORE they calculated the final direct access bill.  The final bills were all debit amounts due to the rate increases and the new procured energy credit calculations.  

PG&E then transferred these debit balances on to the customers' first utility bill.  We found out this had happened when we received calls from angry customers who had received disconnect notices.  They had been told by PG&E that Enron had refused to pay the final bills.  My guess is that most customers paid the balances rather than risk disconnection.

I requested a list of all credit balances transferred from PG&E so we can do an analysis of how much money is involved.  However, I have not sent a written request.  I thought I should confer with you before I send any formal request.

We also have an issue with SCE.  They are transferring debit balances  to residential customers for service PRIOR to direct access.   If you recall, their argument for not reinstating prior balances was that they consider these new accounts.  If that is indeed their process, this is inconsistent.

There was a discussion on this morning's call regarding the status of PUC actions regarding DA suspension.  We requested a legal opinion from out outside regulatory counsel.  It is attached.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact Sue Mara (415.782.7802) or me (415.782.7822).

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Status of CPUC Proposed Decisions on Direct Access Suspension


Jeff:

At your request I am offering this memo to explain the status of the agenda
items before the CPUC on the issue of suspension of the direct access
program.  There are two pending draft decisions at this time, the first is
the proposed decision of ALJ Barnett (Item H-7 on the last agenda) which was
modified by a changed version submitted by Pres. Lynch at 2:45 pm on 9-5-01,
the day before the last meeting.  This version indicated that direct access
was suspended as of the date of the order (which would have been Sept. 6)
and states in another ordering paragraph that the utilities are to advise
their customers that the suspension is effective Sept. 6, 2001, specifically
naming that date.  This order would have been interpreted to suspend direct
access as of Sept. 6 if it had been voted out that day.  The other item,
Agenda Item H-7A on the last agenda, is the Bilas alternate decision which
calls for hearings to determine the impact of direct access on the issuance
of bonds, and does not suspend direct access at this time.

Please be advised that the suspension date contained in H-7 can and probably
will be changed before the orders are considered at the CPUC meeting on
Sept. 20.  Either the Sept 6 date will be changed to the 20th of Sept., or
some other specific date could be inserted at all the locations in the order
dealing with the suspension date.  All that is required to make this change
is the distribution of a changed page on the Escutia table before the
Commission meeting.  Thus, it is important for all direct access supporters
to continue to urge the Commission, especially Commissioner Brown, to
support a suspension date later than Sept. 6, because it is so easy for the
date to be altered under Commission procedures.

Please let me know if you require any additional information on this
subject.

ALJ is allowing CDWR to assert $1.7B in Pacific NW case.  
As noted the other day, their claim against Enron is small ($200,000), but this will expand ripple claims in a big way.

Latest word, as of 5 pm is that Commissioner Bilas has requested a hold on
the direct access suspension item, but that his office does not know why
Loretta Lynch indicated an intention to vote on the matter at her press
conference, and expects that there may be a vote to overturn the hold.  She
is suggesting that parties lobby Comm. Brown to support the hold--which is
the strategy that we have tried to put into effect.  We have not been able
to get any firm response from Brown's office.  We will continue our efforts
to support the hold and monitor the Commission meeting tomorrow and advise
of the result.  Mike Day

Subject: Potential Action Against CPUC RE: Retroactive Suspension of DA
Importance: High


I've asked Sue Mara to try and develop through AReM some form of legal
action that the industry could file if the CPUC goes through with its
current plans to retroactively suspend DA as of July 1.

Our goal should be to file tomorrow evening (assuming CPUC action).  To
make sure that we are on board, it probably makes sense to have a phone
call to discuss the draft sometime tomorrow early afternoon (1pm PST?).
I will leave it to Sue Mara to arrange with the people on this e-mail a
conference call to discuss the draft.

My choice would be to not have Enron file the paper, but rather work
through AReM.

Thanks,

Jim

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding -- the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

Subject:	RE: Call Regarding Prehearing Conference on Our Negative CTC complaint

OK.  Haven't heard back from Bob, but we may be able to avoid the call.  Mike Day got in touch with Edison's attorney this morning and here's the end result.

Edison has agreed to tell the judge on the 7th that, with respect to the complaints we've filed, they agree to take them off calendar until and unless parties ask to put them back on calendar.
Edison will  take the view that the proceedings underway at the commission (and presumably attempts to "settle" with parties) will resolve the issues in the complaint.
The assumption from out end is that the status quo remains intact.  That is, we will continue to pay the Commission, not Edison, for T&D charges during the "time out" on our complaints.  
Mike and Jeanne will make sure that this critical piece, i.e., that we continue to place payments in escrow, will remain intact as part of the "time out."  If it turns out there are any doubts about this aspect, we'll likely need regroup and reconsider our options.

If anyone has any questions or concerns please speak up, and/or if folks would still like to have a very brief call to discuss, we can do that and ensure that Bob is kept in the loop and can weigh in when he returns.

Comments/thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

As Mike Day has indicated, we are 99% sure the CPUC will bifurcate the PX credit payment and DA suspension issues, and vote only on DA suspension on Thursday.  This gives more time to work on a SCE PX credit stipulation.

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1.	Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2.	Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

Late last evening the Assembly committee passed its version of the Edison MOU (SB 78).
Despite attempts by consumer groups to weaken and/or eliminate the DA provisions in the bill, the bill passed with the DA provisions intact.
The DA provisions in the bill that passed out of the committee are essentially the same as those discussed previously (see previous note attached).
The Assembly will now attempt to get the bill out of the Appropriations committee today or tomorrow--the expectation is that the bill will make it out of that committee.
When and if the bill makes it out of the Appropriations committee, the Assembly will attempt to pass it out of the full Assembly.
If it makes it out of the full Assembly, it will then go to the Senate for approval, where the leader of the Senate, John Burton, continues to say publicly that the chances of passage in the Senate are slim.
On the PUC front, efforts are underway to stop the PUC from passing the proposal it issued last week.  
The current PUC proposal would suspend DA retroactive to July 1.
In conversations with the Governor's point people in charge of getting the bill passed, they indicated that they are aware of the problems with the PUC proposal and are working to resolve it.

We'll continue to provide updates.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	California Update--08.27.01

The California PUC
Loretta Lynch held a press conference in Sacramento today to discuss changes to the Commission's previously released proposal regarding Direct Access and the rate agreement between the PUC and DWR.
In the amended proposal discussed and distributed today, Direct Access would end retroactive to July 1.  Customers with contracts executed as of July 1 would would remain Direct Access customers.

The Legislature
The Assembly version of the Senate MOU (SB 78) has not yet been reviewed and voted on in the Committee.
It is scheduled to be reviewed and voted on at 6:30 PM PDT today.
Amendments on Direct Access were released this afternoon (based on negotiations between Davis' office and business customers):
Customers who have consistently been DA since May 2000, including those "involuntarily" returned to bundled service, would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts, and DWR-related exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have consistently been on DA between May 2000 and Jan 17, 2001 would be exempt from charges for Edison's undercollection, DWR's forward contracts and DWR-realted exit fees, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customers who have been on DA between Jan 17, 2001 and August 24, 2001 would be exempt from exit fees related to DWR forward contracts, provided that the PUC finds that no additional stranded costs are created for Edison's remaining customers.
Customer's leaving after August 24th would not qualify for exemptions.
There is considerable work underway to make the August 24th date the deadline for contract execution, rather than the date by which the customer must be DASR'd, in order to qualify for the exemptions.
Direct Access would not be suspended, however, until 90 days after the bill is signed by Davis (if he signs it), i.e., the "effective date" of the bill.
So anyone going to Direct Access between Aug 24 and the effective date would not qualify for any exemptions.
After the 90-day period, DA would be suspended until 1.1.03.
Self-gen in service consistently from May 200 to August 24 would be exempt from Edison's undercollection and DWR charges.
Self-gen that submitted an application to the Energy Commission by August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line.
Self-gen that comes on line after August 24 would be exempt from DWR charges beginning the date that the self-gen comes on line, but the total number of exempt MWs in this category would be limited to 250 MWs per year, on a first-come-first-serve basis.
At least 30% of any increases in net short due to increases in demand would be reserved for self gen.

The choice is between locking in our exposure to our customers at four months versus risking exposure for the full period of time but with an argument that this is either a "tax" or an "indirect" consequence of our re-sourcing them to the utilities.

Subject:	RE: $.01 surcharge as "tax"

The EWS West Power URM desk will need to determine the $$ at stake and help us manage our financial exposure and the appropriate policy response.  It's their $$.  So far, my understanding from the desk is that our current policy recommendations (as outlined in the Mike Smith memo) are the "preferred" outcome - I'll reconfirm.

We could not do that.  On the other hand, if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted, and the CPUC adopts that reasoning, we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot.  I think you are right that we need to understand the implications, both financially and contractually, of the options before the Commission.

Subject:	RE: $.01 surcharge as "tax"

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	$.01 surcharge as "tax"

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Sue --
 
My thoughts on the filing.
 
1.    Pretty hard line with Comm Wood.  I don't have any problems with it as written, but comments like "CYA not Calif Youth Admin" is not appropriate.
2.    We don't deal with the requirement to submit contracts?  Should AReM address this?  My understanding is that for contracts with customers below 20kw we need to submit something (maybe with the price and term blacked-out)?  Is this correct?
3.    In the conclusion, don't we want to ask the PUC to take some affirmative action - tell the industry that they will never implement retroactive suspension, that their is no cost shifting, and that DA customers can extend without penalty?  The filing simply asks for no harm.  
 
Thanks,

Jim

Attached for your review and comment is a second draft of tomorrow's comments on the Wood ACR.  I have added a significantly expanded section dealing with how the Commission's inaction and subsequent action contributed to the flow of customers back and forth between DA and bundled service.  My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section.
 
Also, I have deleted the "CYA - not the California Youth Authority" quip --  I had to have some fun while writing this on Halloween night!

Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chie=
f Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that =
"you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  Below is a C=
liff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 =
PM today.  Attached is the complete work. =20

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "While the amount of=
 such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, th=
ey do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billi=
on dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?At the same time, while there are vast su=
ms due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy seller=
s by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California. =
 Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller=
?  The Chief Judge thinks not."  Another notable quote:  "?it is the opinio=
n of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has=
 not and cannot be substantiated." =20

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which wa=
s summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate=
 offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also =
rejected.=20
 =20
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales =
in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recomme=
ndations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales that a=
re 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to de=
livery."=20

Evidentiary Hearing- "The differences between what the State of California =
believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what =
the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise mater=
ial issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds =
involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-ty=
pe, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to =
the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer =
to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule=
.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating pot=
ential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be =
appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an =
after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the m=
ethodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceede=
d the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund =
period."

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in t=
he June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order =
to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAIS=
O's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period O=
ctober 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001. =20

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (asso=
ciated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) pro=
vide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based =
upon a daily spot gas price.  "In the event that the marginal unit is locat=
ed in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate a=
nd Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the =
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If =
the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas=
 price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by t=
he marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  =
The daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Fina=
ncial Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned deliver=
y points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the =
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and hol=
idays)."=20

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the cal=
culated market clearing price. =20

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the ma=
rket clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may s=
ubtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearin=
g price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E =
and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service=
 prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the rea=
l-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the =
same as set forth in the June 19th Order.=20

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge r=
ecommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculat=
ing refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergen=
cy requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual p=
rices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated=
.

Offsets-  "Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a ref=
und calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all char=
ges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts=
 due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset a=
gainst accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their=
 purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period."

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless=
 the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

I have drafted a detailed outline on our receivables due from the underscheduling penalty.  Because the penalty has not been implemented by the CAISO, our case needs to clearly lay out the CAISO has failed to implement FERC orders and what our receivable is even though we have no invoices to rely on.

The biggest "to dos" on this are: (1) update our receivable amount to the extent we can get more data from CAISO (we have asked for data informally from CAISO), (2) lodge discovery questions re: the computation of our receivable (I drafted questions in Section 5), and (3) review Enron's past positions on this matter.

I am assuming that sections 1. and 2. will go in our pleading and/or policy testimony and that sections 3. AND 4. will be beefed up and/or updated by Murray O'Neil (with help from Stokley and Blair).  

I am on vacation from 8/11//01 - 8/24/01 so please look at this ASAP so that I can answer any questions before I leave.

Dear Colleague,
The Edison Electric Institute just published a paper, The California Electricity Crisis: Lessons for Other States, which I wrote. The paper is available on the Publications page of my website, www.EHirst.com << File: http://www.ehirst.com/ >> . Please let me know if you have any comments on the paper.
Here is a summary of the paper:
        California was supposed to show the rest of the nation a brighter electricity future. That future, as outlined by the California Public Utilities Commission in 1994, envisioned an electricity industry featuring competitive markets. Such markets were intended to produce lower costs and more choices for consumers, while ensuring profits for efficient energy suppliers and encouraging the retirement of old, inefficient power plants.
        Although the first two years of restructuring (beginning in April 1998) seemed to bear out these promises, the last year has been a disaster for California's electricity consumers, taxpayers, and electric utilities. Part of the fallout from California's electricity crisis is considerable concern-even opposition-in other states to restructuring the electricity industry. 
        Although a few states have decided, based on the California experience, not to restructure, I believe that is the wrong outcome. Instead, the primary lessons other states should learn from California are that competitive markets can work; competition is not to blame for California's problems; and basic economic principles of supply, demand, and prices affect market outcomes.
        Section 2 of this paper briefly reviews the history of electricity regulation and restructuring in California and the problems that occurred beginning in May 2000. Section 3, the heart of this paper, offers guidance to other states on the key ingredients of a competitive electricity industry. This section makes several points:  
Maintain a favorable investment and regulatory climate for new generation to ensure that enough generation capacity is online and planned to meet growing loads.  
Ensure that enough infrastructure (transmission capacity and natural gas pipeline capacity) is in place and planned to meet growing loads, maintain reliability, connect new generators to the grid, support large regional markets, and provide fuel to power plants.  
Encourage retail customers to participate in dynamic-pricing and voluntary-load-reduction programs (i.e., couple retail and wholesale markets).  
Create honest retail competition: avoid standard-offer rates with artificial discounts and create conditions that encourage many companies to offer retail services without favoring individual competitors.  
Encourage electricity suppliers to manage and diversify their supply and price risks.  
Create efficient and integrated wholesale markets for energy, ancillary services, and transmission congestion.  
Monitor and minimize horizontal market power (generation) and vertical market power (combined ownership and operation of generation and transmission).  

        Ultimately, competitive markets for electricity will lower costs and prices, better align consumer prices with producer costs, improve producer efficiency in both investment and operation, maintain or improve reliability, and yield greater innovation in customer services and pricing options. 
        But, this transition from one industry structure to another is turning out to be long and complicated. It is complicated because electricity is so important to our modern, high-tech society; electricity is our most flexible fuel, providing light, heat, motive power, and the energy to operate all our electronic equipment. Also, electricity truly is a real-time product for which production and consumption must occur at the same time. 
        Although the problems that have occurred in California are substantial and worrisome, regulators and legislators in other states should focus on the long-term benefits of competitive electricity markets and accept the possible short-term problems that may occur. They also need to recognize that wholesale markets are regional in scope and extend far beyond the boundaries of any single state. Finally, competition in retail and wholesale markets must be coordinated; in particular, it is not possible to have competitive wholesale markets unless at least some retail load faces time varying prices. 
        If states restructure properly to create competitive markets for wholesale energy and retail services, we should all benefit. Consumers will enjoy lower prices, they will have many more choices of energy services and price-risk tradeoffs, reliability will be improved because most reliability services will be obtained through markets instead of by engineering edict, and the financial risks associated with building and operating power plants will be assigned properly to investors rather than consumers.

Subject: IMPORTANT ! : Motion of San Diego Gas & Electric Company (U 902-E)=
 for Adoption of an Electric Procurement Cost Recovery Mechanism and for Or=
der Shortening Time


Yesterday, SDG&E filed a motion for adoption of an electric procurement cos=
t recovery mechanism and for an order shortening time for parties to file c=
omments on the mechanism.  The attached email from SDG&E contains the motio=
n, an executive summary, and a detailed summary of  their proposals and rec=
ommendations governing procurement of the net short energy requirements for=
 SDG&E's customers.  The utility requests a 15-day comment period, which me=
ans comments would have to be filed by September 10 (September 8 is a Satur=
day).  Reply comments would be filed 10 days later.

The filing provides the following discussion of direct access:


  _____ =20

"Developing the net short requirements of consumers depends on the extent t=
o which they might be served instead by third party providers. The level of=
 direct access will affect these net short requirements. At present, there =
is substantial uncertainty concerning the future disposition of direct acce=
ss and third party supply of retail customers that jeopardizes creation of =
an optimal plan. This uncertainty has the potential for increasing costs to=
 San Diego retail customers as a result of unnecessary over- or under commi=
tments. To resolve this uncertainty, the Commission needs to coordinate dir=
ect access with resource planning, at least on an interim basis. SDG&E disc=
usses below how to provide for this coordination.=20

As the retail market matures, SDG&E expects that direct access elections wi=
ll gain stability and will not be characterized by severe volatility. That =
stability will allow planners to make reasoned assumptions on direct access=
 and rely on them in developing a procurement plan. However, today, direct =
access is subject to substantial uncertainty. Before the high prices of the=
 summer of 2000, approximately 20% of SDG&E's retail load had elected direc=
t access. By the beginning of 2001, direct access had reduced by nearly hal=
f. More recently, SDG&E has seen an increase in direct access, perhaps as a=
 result of two factors: first, would direct access customers be able to avo=
id paying a share of CDWR contract costs, and second, would the state suspe=
nd direct access, as appears to be permitted under ABx-1 1. Furthermore, th=
e legislature is considering legislation that would permit direct access, a=
nd other bills that would encourage municipal aggregation of load. The effe=
ct of this latter bill is similar to direct access, but it could cause larg=
e quantities of load to leave or return to the system quite abruptly.=20

These events illustrate the need for added coordination between direct acce=
ss and resource planning. The necessary coordination could come by using an=
 open enrollment period each planning cycle under which direct access elect=
ions take place. During that enrollment period, the utility is provided inf=
ormation on the amount of load electing direct access (or municipal aggrega=
tion) and the length of the direct access commitment. This open enrollment =
period would last for 90 days and commence 180 days before SDG&E is schedul=
ed to submit its procurement plan. Customers over 20kW would make commitmen=
ts to service by suppliers other than SDG&E of at least 5 years. Smaller cu=
stomers would make minimum one year commitments. These commitments and the =
use of a specific enrollment period would provide SDG&E with the informatio=
n it needs to plan to meet net short requirements and minimize the risk of =
over- or under-commitment.=20

In order to ensure an orderly process that protects consumers, change of se=
rvice would not occur until the commission ruled on the procurement plan, a=
nd, to the extent that the commission determined that excessive direct acce=
ss placed an unreasonable burden on utility customers, it could choose to l=
imit direct access. Those electing to leave utility procurement would pay a=
n exit fee to cover the costs of commitments made by CDWR and utility retai=
ned generation committed to those customers in order to protect remaining c=
ustomers. As a result of this change, SDG&E would not plan to provide commo=
dity service to departing customers. Customers returning from direct access=
 prematurely would be subject to a re-entry fee and to spot energy pricing,=
 again to protect those customers who did not elect to switch.
=20
Coordinating direct access with the planning process, at least for a near-t=
erm period, is important to ensuring a reasonable procurement plan."

  _____ =20


The filing also briefly discusses competitive default supplier role:

  _____ =20

"When the State embarked on industry restructuring, one purpose was to take=
 advantage of the benefits that competitive markets can provide. Although C=
alifornia's experience with markets has not been as anticipated, it is stil=
l possible that a disciplined application of the market with adequate regul=
atory oversight can offer advantages to consumers. In fact, some states hav=
e undertaken to use the competitive market to meet customers' net short req=
uirements. For example, in parts of Pennsylvania, the State decided to auct=
ion off a piece of the procurement obligation to the competitive market. Ca=
lifornia may decide that it wants to do the same type of thing. If a portio=
n of the net short is auctioned off in this manner, from a planning standpo=
int, it should be treated the same as direct access: SDG&E will need adequa=
te notice and information to facilitate its planning for any net short posi=
tion remaining to be served, and the same use of exit fees and re-entry fee=
s should also apply."

  _____ =20


There are a number of issues here which I think WPTF may want to comment up=
on, as we have dealt with many of these issues in previous filings.  Please=
 let me (and others) know if you agree.

Based on information received at 4 pm this afternoon from Comm. Brown, the
CPUC is reportedly set to suspend direct access tomorrow with an effective
date of Sept. 20 for the suspension.  There has been a huge drop in state
tax revenues this week as a result of economic inactivity due to the
terrotist attacks, and this appears to have reinvigorated the need to issue
bonds--if they can be sold.  In any event, it appears Brown is a solid vote
for suspension as of tomorrow.  Mike Day

The workshop conducted by the Energy Division on Friday on the DWR revenue
requirement submitted to the Commission on July  23rd was basically a
question and answer session. A representative of DWR was present as were
several representatives of the consulting firm Navigant which assisted DWR
in constructing its revenue requirement request.  The representatives of
Navigant fielded most of the questions.

Not much new information was garnered.  A little more clarity was shed on
certain areas. Of interest to Enron would be that in determining the net
short for each of the UDCs for which DWR was purchasing it assumed no change
in the current direct access levels (which is approximately 2% of the load
in the state) through 2002.

Other points of clarification included:

(1) A question exists with respect to whether DWR is responsible for the ISO
costs billed to the UDCs for the period of January through June of 2001.

(2) Any payments which were made to DWR to date by the UDCs would be netted
against the revenue requirements requests for the first and second quarter
of this year.  PG&E indicated that DWR's numbers for the revenue received
from PG&E to date do not match its own accounting.

(3) The net short calculation for each UDC was derived by using the net
short forecasts provided by each of the UDCs an modifying them to take into
account (1) a 4% reduction in load due to conservation efforts; (2) a 2%
reduction in load due to price elasticity increasing to 3% by January 2001;
(3) estimated impacts of the 20/20 program (assuming also a similar program
for next summer); (4) the impact of the UDCs curtailment programs.  Once
again, PG&E indicated its belief that DWR's net short projection for PG&E
was erroneous.

(4)  DWR explained that the basis for the projection that they would need
1.65 cents out of the three cents rate increase was that for sales made by
DWR they already receive the UDC generation rate (i.e., approximately 6.8
cent for PG&E and 7.2 cent for SCE).  On top of that, they need the 1.65
cents.

SCE submitted four pages of written questions to DWR on their revenue
request.  DWR is to respond in writing (and serve on all people on the
service list ) by Tuesday the 31st.  To the extent that the questions are
applicable to PG&E, they will answer the question with respect to both UDCs.

Please call if you have any questions.

Subject: CRITICAL!! IMMEDIATE REVIEW NEEDED 


THE COMMISSION HAS ISSUED A REVISED DRAFT OF THE BARNETT DECISION TODAY
WHICH RETROACTIVELY SUSPENDS DIRECT ACCESS TO JULY 1.
 
The cover letter states as follows:  
 
"This version differs from the draft mailed on August 15, 2001 in several
ways. First, the effective date of the suspension has been changed from
September 1, 2001 to July 1, 2001 (as proposed in the draft mailed June 15,
2001). Second, the draft decision clarifies that customers who have executed
direct access contracts prior to July 1, 2001 may continue to receive power
from electric service providers for the initial term of the contracts.
Several other editorial and explanatory changes have also been made. 
 
Assembly Bill No. 1 from the First Extraordinary Session (AB1X) requires
that direct access be suspended until the Department of Water Resources no
longer supplies power to the customers of the three largest regulated
electricity companies. It directs that the Commission determine the
effective date of the suspension. In order to reduce the possibility of harm
to customers and to resolve potential conflict, parties should comment on:
(1) whether AB1X suspends the entire direct access program, including all
transactions under that program, (2) how the Commission can comply with AB1X
if it exempts written contracts for direct access executed before July 1,
2001 from the suspension, and (3) whether July 1, 2001 is an appropriate
date for the suspension......Comments on the draft decision are permitted.
Those comments are to be electronically served on the service list (for
those who have electronic addresses) no later than 10:00 a.m. on September
4, 2001, and shall be filed with the Commission by 5:00 p.m. on that date."
 
The specific wording in the Decision is:
 
"The Legislature has directed this Commission to suspend direct access until
DWR no longer procures power for the retail end-users, and we find it should
be suspended effective July 1, 2001.  The Legislative direction is clear;
and the suspension should apply to SCE, Pacific Gas and Electric Company
(PG&E), and San Diego Gas & Electric Company (SDG&E).  In the interest of
providing cost stability for current direct access customers, written
contracts for direct access signed before July 1, 2001 are exempt from the
suspension for the initial term of the contracts."
 
It also provides that:

"In comments on the draft decision, several parties questioned the need for
the Commission to implement the legislative suspension of direct access as
soon as July 1, 2001.  By the draft decision mailed for comment to the
parties on June 15, 2001, market participants were provided notice that
direct access would be suspended as of July 1, 2001.  The Commission
postponed its consideration of the draft decision.  However, we do not
change the effective date of the suspension.  The underlying legislation was
introduced on January 3, 2001, enrolled and sent to the Governor on February
1, 2001, and signed by the Governor the same day.  Market participants have
now had eight months since then to prepare for this event.  We do not wish
to reward customers who have switched to direct access since July 1, 2001 in
the hope that we would change the effective date of the suspension when this
switch could disadvantage customers who continue to receive bundled service
from the utility." 

The decision also states that no parties have raised any factual issues
which would justify hearings, which presumably, although not explicitly,
disposes of the joint AReM/WPTF filing.  I presume we will want to file in
strong opposition.  Suggestions on strategy?  It might be a good idea to
have a conference call on this and get started immediately with raising a
movement to counter this.

Subject:	RE: California AG's Invesigator/Gray Davis' Customer Contact

We are considering four courses of action:  a suit against Gray Davis for tortious interference with contract; a suit for an injuntion against the AG; a letter of to our customers; and a letter to the press from one of our customers.  

California counsel is researching whether under California law state officials can be sued for tortious conduct.  The answer depends upon whether the State has waived its sovereign immunity that would normally protect it from such suits.  We may not have a definitive answer to this question until Monday.  If California law does provide for such a waiver, we could sue the Governor and the State for tortious interference with conduct.  

An additional obstacle to enjoining the AG is that the California statutes give the AG broad authority as to how he conducts an investigation.  Still, if we can get evidence that the AG's investigator is making untrue or misleading statements or engaging in some other misconduct (we would need an affidavit from a customer as proof), we could go into court to complain that the AG is abusing his authority.

A letter to our customers could cause Davis and Lockyer to back off.  Neither wants negative reports about them circulating among California businessmen (who they primarily see as potential campaign contributors).  The letter would lay out the "truth about the California energy crisis and Davis/Lockyer's misguided and politically-motivated search for a scapegoat."  We could perhaps use Judge Kobayashi's statement in the Dunn subpoena proceeding that the California energy crisis was "created in part by all arms of the California government" to support our case.  We could also use published reports (if verifiable) about the DWR's imprudent purchases of power, and cast the AG's investigation as an attempt to divert attention from Davis/Lockyer's lack of any success in addressing the the crisis.  We could thank our customers for not being swayed by the demagogery and rhetoric, and for continuing to be our business partners.  We would want this to be positive in tone.

A fourth response would be a letter from one (or more) of our customers to a newspaper complaining about the harassment by the AG's office.  This letter could make some of the same points as the letter from us to our customers. 

We are still thinking of other approaches.  We will have the answers to the legal questions buttoned up by Monday at the latest.  Please call me with any questions or comments (x52402).

Subject:	SF Giants / California AG's Office Communication

David Tagliarino, Enron Sports Marketing Group, received a call today from John Yee, CFO of the SF Giants.  David, John and I got back on the phone this morning.  Following is a summary of our discussion:

John Yee, CFO, SF Giants, received a letter from the CA AG's office requesting their cooperation in an "....investigation concerning Enron....".  (John will fax that letter to me and I will circulate it)
John called the AG's office per their request in the letter received
The AG's office was digging for a bunch of information:
total MWH consumed
contract start date
term of contract
general questions about T's & C's
whether Enron had cancelled the contract
who was supplying electricity
copies of the agreements and letters of communication from Enron to the SF Giants
John was generally responsive and indicated that Enron has been great, has honored its contract, still has a contract in place, etc.
John pushed back on supplying any more information without a written request from the AG's office, and then also indicated that they would only supply what was required by law
The AG's office responded by indicating that they may have to subpoena the Giants
John will wait and see what the AG's office does
He will keep us in the communication loop and make sure that we have copies of the communication from the AG's office

Thanks - Dan

Wednesday morning, June 27 (before the CPUC decision to delay the vote on DA), I gave Marty Sunde this view on exit fees and surcharges for DWR costs in the California market:

There is a 75% probability that customers who go to direct access and who used utility service between January and June 2001 will pay an exit fee calculated as the difference between market price and utility rates during that period.  The exit fee could also include the going forward costs or alternatively, those costs could be passed along in the form of a uniform surcharge.  In other words, with regard to past costs, regulators or legislators would require DA customers to pay the amount they belive had been sucked from the state during the January-June crisis period.  I said the "retroactive ratemaking" argument is a nicety that California could easily dispense with.

Now that we know the CPUC decision will be delayed, I think the probability of exit fees for retroactive costs is even higher - either the DA legislation will pass between now and July 3, or Carl Wood will change the PUC order to get the "jailbreaking" customers to pay up.

Every day at Enron I learn to be a little less modest.  I am not there yet, but I keep on trying.

In terms of $s, we can add $30 million to our receivables.  I will try to get the backup from Chris Stokley.

Attached is an Assigned Commissioner's Ruling issued yesterday by
Commissioners Lynch and Brown soliciting comments on the Revenue Requirement
submitted by DWR on July 23rd.

The revenue requirement is increased from the $9.2 billion submitted in May
to $13.072 billion, but covers a longer period of time (the period of
January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002).  The revenue requirement is
expected to pay for 118,930 GWh of power.  The revenue requirement is
divided among the three UDCs as follows (1) PG&E = $5.2 billion; (2) SCE =
$5.8 billion; and (3) SDG&E = $2.1 billion. The revenue requirement was
divided among the three UDCs based on a uniform cost per MWh of net short
energy purchased by DWR.  The bond proceeds will be applied in a manner to
supplement the revenue from the customers to DWR such that the net revenue
requirement falls within the retail rate adjustments adopted by the CPUC for
PG&E and SCE (i.e., the three cents), and assumes a comparable rate
adjustment for SDG&E

The ACR asks for comments on the revenue requirement submitted by DWR,
particularly in the areas of (a) the relationship between the UDCs retained
generation revenue requirement and the DWR revenue requirement ; and (b)
DWR's request for the establishment of "specific charges payable to DWR for
the power sold by DWR to retail end use customers" (e.g., should this be in
a form of separate rate element or in the form of a gross revenue amount to
be derived from rates).

The ACR also requests more information from DWR.  Specifically it requests
information on (a) the revenue DWR has already received from the UDCs; (2)
how the revenue requirement for ancillary services was calculated; (c) more
specifics on Operating Costs; and (4) a numerical illustration of the
derivation of the 1.65 cents per kWh as representing the average portion of
the 3 cent rate increase that DWR needs to generate its $13 billion revenue
requirement (a figure that was apparently reported in the press).  DWR is
suppose to serve this information on the Commission and parties to the
proceeding by Thursday the 26th.

There will be a technical workshop held on Friday the 27th to address DWR's
revenue requirement.

It is the Commission's intent after the receipt and review of comments to
issue a PD and to vote on the revenue requirement at its August 23rd
meeting.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like to submit comments
on the revenue requirement or have me attend the workshop.

Ursala:

The CPUC set up many road blocks to forward contracting.  The history is complicated.  The following note came from a chronology published by CA legislature Republicans.

I think the bullets could say:

?	Load serving utilities were given extremely limited authority to enter into PX administered block forward contracts before spring of 2000.
?	
?	With the run up in spot prices, all three utilities request and receivedthe ability to enter into forward contracts during Summer 2000.  However, preapproval or clear review guidelines were not forthcoming by the CPUC. Utilities, faced with second guessing and claims that forward prices were "too high," did not enter into contracts.
?	
?	By Fall 2000, the utilities still had not forward contracted in any substantial way.  Despite numerous requests made to the CPUC, it had taken no meaningful actions to improve the certainty of recovery of prudent foward contracts entered into by utilities.  To this day, contracting guidelines do not exist.





Excerpt/Source:
October 16, 2000 PG&E files documents with the FERC showing huge cash
flow shortfalls. PG&E writes Loretta Lynch that after 9 weeks, the CPUC
staff has not produced guidelines for long-term contracts and still has not
done so today. SCE later concurred that they were hitting roadblocks with
the CPUC staff while trying to get approval of long-term contracts. Edison
asks a total of seven times in 20 months for broader authority to make the
kind of electricity buys the governor now says will deliver us from the
crisis. Each time, the CPUC either denies Edison's request or approves it
only after applying significant restrictions that ultimately make it
impractical for the utility.

Mary lynne, thanks for the numbers.  It is exactly the information that I was hoping for.

I ran some quick totals on the data.  Here is what I saw for the commercial customers:
72,559 MWh delivered for commercial during this time period.
Total positive CTC owed to utility of $1,749,741
Average CTC for these customers of $24.11/MWh


Without opining on whether we owe these or not, I still need to figure out whether they've been booked and if so how, and as more come in we need to figure out what to do with them.  A few accounting/booking questions:
Have these been booked as a payable to PG&E
Do we think that they can be offset against any negative ctc's that PG&E owes us.
Is there a clean process in place for tracking and booking these.
Can we do a flash vs. actual on these volumes for the time period.
Who has the schedule of historic negative CTC receivalbles and what the accounting treatment has been?
I think we need to prepare a "one stop shopping" binder or folder with all of the positive and negative ctc information going back through time.  Perhaps this has been done already, but I haven't seen it.

A couple other questions / observations:
Steve, do we have any idea how they calculate this?
In September we will receive charges of approximately $14.6 million applying our load against a $24/MWh CTC.
JIm, what is our process at the CPUC to dispute these charges and clarify PG&E's methodology?
I need to get a handle on this ASAP.

Here is the DWR revenue requirement, which is good news for creditors.  It is significantly less on an annual basis, $2.66 B per annum vesus $4.2 B to $4.4B per annum shown before.  This difference can largely be explained by the fall-off in spot curves which explains $1.3 B per annum of the decrease.  All eyes will be on the utility's generation rate cases at CPUC on their retained gen, QF and billaterals.

I mislabled the starting time-period as 2000, instead of 2001.   The rest of the figures are correct.  Jeff and I spoke about a comparison with the prior DWR forecast from April 27th, which is added.  Note that the definition of  non-contracted now is really those volumes which are either true spot or contracts less than 90 days in duration.   In other words, heavily exposed to price risk.   A revised file is attached above.

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative "mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Sue is right, of course.  But....

Her argument turns in part on her assumption that going into the deal back in 1996, the utilities were agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices.  Like most parties back then, they never contemplated a world where energy prices would exceed their capped average rate of $65 (+/-).  In other words, they assumed they would recoup most, if not all, of their stranded costs.  They may have even assumed (certainly they seem to be arguing for it now) that they DESERVED to recoup their stranded costs, and that AB 1890 was designed to guarantee it.

I do not know all of the details of the history, but y'all have spoken of a ruling (PUC? Court?) to address the specific issue of negative CTC, zero minimum bill, etc.  Obviously, this ruling was in our favor, which lends a lot of credibility to Sue's argument.  But the fact that the original dereg plan was so vague as to require a ruling on this issue ex post opens the door to a counterargument by the utilities, namely that at the time of AB 1890's passage, they were not explicitly agreeing to take on the risk of high wholesale prices -- they were instead forced to do so by later interpretations of the law.  If they had known then....

Please note that I do remember what side I am on. :)  I am not saying that this counterargument is correct.  Indeed, the negative CTC ruling is de facto evidence that they are wrong, even if they didn't know it going into the deal.  I only present all of this b/c I think it is the only halfway sensible argument they can make in the face of Sue's impeccable logic, and I think we ought to at least have given it some thought in case they try to bring it up.

Attached is a Word document with my notes from the PG&E meeting last Thursday August 1.
I am also including an Excel spreadsheet that shows how the PX credit is calculated under the various methods that have been discussed.

My conclusion is:
PG&E continues to make unpredictable and arbitrary decisions without applying with the CPUC.  If not for the PX receivable, I would recommend an immediate protest to halt this behaviour.
They are also bending the existing rules so far as to strain credibility.

The SCE method of calculating a PX credit is the best choice both from a logical perspective and does not require an adjustment to our mark.  (Again, setting aside the PX receivable issue.)  Many external parties support it, the CPUC is heading in this direction.
It makes sense because it keeps DA customers paying for the services they use, i.e. T&D.
DA may be getting a "break" to the extent the current generation rate pays for "past sins", i.e. if market prices are below embedded generation plus the 3-cent surcharge.  This is where a yet-to-be determined nonbypassable CTC may come from.

Setting the PX credit equal to the Market Price is unlikely to be approved, on a go-forward basis.  If PX Credit = Market, the  DA customer will only pay frozen rates.  Although this confirms to AB1890 since the rate freeze is not technically over, it is unlikely that this will go forward since:
bundled customers are paying more than rate-freeze rates
there is no agreed-upon market price

Tim,

It appears that they are following their "adjusted" formula almost exactly as we had calculated it a couple of weeks ago.  The spreadsheet I put together shows PG&E's Adjusted CTC for the months of Jun, Jul, and Aug (the time period in which >96% of the volumes appear) to be $23.13, $25.41, and $23.79 respectively.  The average of these three?  $24.11 !!!  (Okay, it's a simple average, not weighted, but we are certainly well within the ballpark.)

New West called to say it had settled with SCE on the PX Credit.  I asked if they agreed to the reduction in the pX credit going forward.  She said that they have no customers buying commodity from them, so it doesn't apply.  I'm guessing this means that they agreed to Edison's proposal, but it has no affect on them.  I asked if they would be supporting SCE's plan at the CPUC.  She said "no".  We'll see. 

New Energy and Krogers met with SCE and had the same kind of meeting that we had.  Krogers (grocery store chain) had a Sr management person fly out for the meeting and was incredulous with what he heard.  So far, they are taking the same position we are.

I'll let you know if I hear more.

Subject:	Follow-up Meeting w/Edison re: Negative CTC

As we anticipated, today's call did not advance the ball from where we left off last week with Edison.
Edison is sticking to its guns, claiming that all customers, DA and bundled alike, should pay for Edison's undercollection, i.e., they don't owe us money, we owe them money.
The call was short and ended with an agreement that:
	1) we'll both continue plodding along in the PUC process with all the other stakeholders who are arguing over these issues, 
	2) we'll keep lines of communication open--to the extend that anyone has any new ideas they want to share, contacts will 	be made, and 
	3) if nothing has happened at the PUC by the time Edison starts readying itself to pay people in Q1'02, then we'll get together 	to try to get agreement on a number as the PUC process continues to work itself out.

If anyone has any questions, just let us know.

Best,
Jeff

A few weeks ago, we (government affairs) approached John Fielder of Edison to see if there was any chance that Edison might be willing to reach a deal on our Negative CTC/PX credit claim.
After discussions with RAC, we offered to take 90 cents on the dollar for amounts owed through March 1. (There's general agreement with Edison on what the number is up to January 17, which would only leave 1.17--3.1 in dispute.  But recall there's still the FERC refund issue which complicates the issue.) 
We asked for 10% down immediately and a binding agreement that Edison would pay us by a date certain sometime in the next quarter.  
In exchange, we said we'd drop our law suits at the PUC. In one suit, we're asking the PUC to have Edison pay us. In the other, we've stopped paying Edison for transportation costs until the PUC gets Edison to pay us.  We're depositing what we owe Edison in an escrow account pending resolution.
We also agreed to work with Edison to get the PUC to end the whole residual CTC/PX credit framework retroactive to March 1, 2001.  (That would reduce Edison's exposure to negative CTC and our exposure to positive CTC.)
For his part, Fielder was looking (in addition) for 1) an agreement on our part to forebear, and 2) an agreement that everyone, including DA customers, should pay what they rightly owe for a) Edison's undercollection, b) the bonds, and c) DWR's stranded contract costs.
We never resumed the talks in earnest because soon after our talk, Edison struck its bailout deal with the PUC. 

With respect to what else we could offer them:
>From a commercial standpoint, I'm sure you're scouring that front, and I may not have much to add.  But given the credit risk associated with the utility and Edison's other subs, devising a commercial option to help settle the negative CTC claim seems like a challenge.
One possible avenue might be the $250 MM in hedging activity the PUC agreed to in its bailout settlement with Edison.  Edison is authorized to hedge its generation and QF fuel costs for up to $250 MM under the settlement. (But this would expose us to PUC regulatory risk, in addition to Edison's credit risk.)
Another commercial angle might be Mission Energy, but again, not sure how much better Mission fares from a credit perspective.
One idea that we've bounced around that might appeal to Edison--but may or may not be appealing to us--us is to agree to take a note from Edison.  That is, in return for 100 cents on the dollar, we'd agree to take, for example, a 3-year note at some agreed to coupon.  
This should appeal to Edison since 1) it takes us off the list of folks who might take them in, 2) it might provide a useful template that Edison could use with other creditors, and 3) it lessens the overall financing Edison needs to arrange (bridge loan, etc.) in the near-term to pay its creditors.
The "note" angle could be packaged up with the other regulatory issues explored in the first call with Fielder.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff

Gang:

Further clarification on what happened at the pre-hearing conference today:

The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time (most likely the ruling will be out within a week):

1.  PX Audit -- The Commission will decide the issue on the current record (this is fine with us)
2. Implementation of Suspension of DA. -- This includes all the DASR issues, ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like.  The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings.  The following schedule was agreed to:

11/16 -- Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities
11/28 -- Parties file comments on utilities' proposal; may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed (although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary)
12/4 -- Parties file responses on the comments

All other issues will be addressed at another Pre-hearing conference on 12/12. 

In response to a question, the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time, but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue.

He also said several times, however, that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents. (To most logical people, this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue  --  but, hey, this is California.)

Bottomline:  This turned out better than we had expected.  We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side.

Subject:	Update on California PUC Hearing--DA Suspension Implementation; Exit Fees; PX Credit, etc.--11.07.01

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.
>From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

I spoke to Allan Zaremberg, Pres. of the Cal. Chamber of Commerce.  He
met with the Governor's folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to
discuss undercollection strategies, the MOU, and direct access.  He is
not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the
Chamber's satisfaction.  The Gov's folks truly believe that the
successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even if
Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation,  Allan believes she doesn't
really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I told
him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen
agrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see
much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides.
Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that
nothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation with
Hertzberg's office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy
agenda at this time, although they have not given up.

An update from the meeting we had with SCE on August 9:  SCE said that it h=
as TEMPORARILY stopped charging CTC because it doesn't know what to charge =
for DWR. Meanwhile, it continues to keep track of the dollar flows through =
the TCBA and the new account set up for DWR.  Once the CPUC decides on the =
DWR's revenue requirement, SCE expects that it will charge generation-relat=
ed CTC again.  There is also continuing CTC related to QF contracts that wi=
ll return (and goes beyond 3/31/02) once QF contracts are above the "market=
".  SCE is also considering filing a petition with the CPUC to get guidance=
 on all these matters. Once the CPUC rules on SCE"s advice letter approache=
s, SCE plans to go back and re-bill begining with Jan 18 (it used some diff=
erent PX credit approaches early on and switched to this approach for bills=
 going out June 4). I didn't ask the question about calculating CTC back to=
 Jan 18.  I guess if the DWR rev req is retroactive and leaves room for CTC=
, they will bill it.  The other twist I had forgotten about is that they ha=
ve a one-half cent charge added to the embedded gen rate of 10.27 cents (ma=
king it about 10.77 cents) that collects the $400 million that was uncollec=
ted while the CPUC played around with a rate design for the three cent surc=
harge.  The half cent addition is for 12 months.

Subject:=09Summary or PX Credit Proposals


I wanted to summarize the conclusions from our meeting on Wednesday, August=
 8th.  Please let me know if I have misrepresented anything. =20

Below is a description of four proposals which may help resolve issues asso=
ciated with PX credits or mitigate Enron's exposure to PX credits.  Steve S=
wain has the responsibility for evaluating each proposal, and his goal is t=
o have recommendations for EWS/EES management on August 14th. =20

Current Issues:
1)  The methodology for calculating PX credits after January 18 is undeterm=
ined (SCE and PG&E have implemented different methodologies)
2)  Applicability of the 1 cent surcharge to direct access customers (PG&E =
is passing thru to DA customers, SCE is not)
3)  Impact to Enron if  FERC implements  retroactive changes to the CAL PX =
clearing prices from Oct 2, 2000 thru January 18th which result in revised =
PX credits=20
4)  Recoupment of outstanding PX credits against future payments for T&D
5)  Uncertainty surrounding future tariffs (CTC or other pass through charg=
es), making it difficult to hedge price risk in forward positions
6)  Large uncollected receivables from both PG&E and SCE


The four proposals are as follows:

SCE Recommended Approach=20
=09This approach assumes no PX (or PE) credit effective from January 18, 20=
01 forward.  Mary Lynne and Diann will work with Steve to quantify the =09g=
ross PX receivable (as billed by each utility)  which would  be reversed.  =
 This approach will ensure that only charges for T&D (no =09generation/comm=
odity costs, CTC charges, or surcharges for CDWR, including the 1 cent)  wi=
ll be applicable to Direct Access customers. =20

=09Enron would request the following:
=091) Assurances that no surcharges for CDWR will be passed through to EES =
or EEMC
=092) SCE will support our historical PX  credit receivable as an "allowabl=
e claim" at a minimum and would provide additional credit support if possib=
le. =20
=093) PG&E will support Enron's recoupment argument=20
=094) Both utilities will immediately reinstate the Cumulative Credit Balan=
ces on utility bills and agree to a netting arrangement at the utility pare=
nt =09level.=20
=095) Both utilities agree to not adjust the historical PX credits, if/when=
 an adjustment of historical PX clearing prices is mandated by FERC=20

=09Other consideration:
=09Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re =
CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


PG&E Recommended Approach
=09This approach assumes the PX calculation methodology effective January 1=
8, 2001 would include an "avoided cost"  component.  This avoided cost =20
=09component would include, owned generation, QF purchases, actual CDWR pur=
chases for the utility, bilateral purchase contracts, and ISO purchases.  =
=09This resulting "avoided cost" would be used in lieu of the PX clearing p=
rice in the old PX formula through March, 2002.    If the actual CDWR purch=
ase =09costs are not included, then the surcharge (along with the embedded =
gen costs)  should be included in the calculation. =20
=09
=09Enron would request the following:
=09Same as above

=09Other Consideration:
=09Enron  would continue to be exposed to "price" risk attributable to the =
actions of the utility at a minimum through March, 2002.  This would hamper=
 =09Enron's ability =09to hedge the positions in the retail portfolio.=20

Hybrid Approach
=09This approach assumes that the PG&E approach is applicable from January =
18, 2001 through September 1, 2001 and that the SCE approach is =09applicab=
le from September 1st forward.   This approach might be necessary as a comp=
romise for both utilities to provide their support of the proposal.=20

=09Enron would request the following:
=09Same as SCE and PG&E approach

=09Other considerations:
=09Ability to hedge price risk in the retail portfolio, without concern re =
CTC or other surcharge amounts. =20


Enron Model=20
=09This approach assumes we continue to support a market based (NP15 and SP=
15) calculation methodology for the PX credit.  =20

=09Enron would request the following:
=09It is unlikely we would receive any level of cooperation from either PG&=
E and SCE.   The consensus from legal, regulatory, and EWS commercial is =
=09the probability of getting this approach approved is low.   However, und=
erstanding this amount, at a minimum, can be used to help defend the "value=
"=09Enron is foregoing in order to reach agreement with the utilities and C=
PUC.

=09Other considerations:
=09This approach would give Enron the ability to hedge "price" risk, but th=
is is somewhat offset with  incremental credit exposure associated with the=
 =09actual collection of the PX credit.


Again, please let me know if this does not clearly represent what we conclu=
ded in Wednesday's meeting.

Thanks,
Wanda Curry

FYI.  New amendments out on DA that Keeley's accepted that I'm faxing to you right now.  Also, it's 82XX we're talking about, not 83XX.  83XX is the bill that Wright's authoring with the Rs.

Also faxing to you Reliant's "Dear Dunn, Go to Hell, Sincerely, Reliant" letter.

Best,
Jeff

The games continue in California.  

The date of suspension now being considered in 83xx is July 12.  We are still working (1) to define this in a way that is favorable to getting our recent DASR group authorized for DA service or (2) supporting some other solution.

Will keep everyone informed as information comes in.  

By the way, I've asked Evan Hughes for a detailed listing of how moving the date impacts our success ratio.

Subject:	FW: California Update--0717.01

Both 82XX and 83XX are to be discussed in committee today.  Significantly, an amendment that is expected to be included in 82XX would establish July 12 as the start date for when the PUC may not authorize any new or replacement direct transactions.

By contrast, 83XX directs the commission to authorize direct transactions on an open enrollment basis not less than 2 times each year, conicident with the expiration of DWR purchases.

Nothing more yet from the CPUC on its intended action.

What people know:

Hertzberg (et al's) bill (82XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow (perhaps beginning at 10 AM) , at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  Most, including us, oppose unless significantly amended.
The Wright (D) -Richman (R) bill (83XX)was heard in an "informational" hearing today and still sits in the Assembly Energy Committee.  It will be heard again tomorrow, at which time parties will have a chance to support/oppose and ask for amendments.  From our perspective, this is the best bill out there yet, though it still has serious problems---it isn't available electronically yet, but should be tomorrow, and I'll distribute then.  The chances of the joint D-R bill being successful are slim, however, since it's up against the Speakers competing bill.  There is talk that the Speaker will try to negotiate with Wright/Richman tonight and include any agreement in his bill (82XX).
The original version of the Governor's MOU bill sits in the Senate.  Most believe that Burton will put it up for a vote this week and it will fail.
The Senate's version of the MOU (Sher-Peace-Kuehl) (78XX)came out today.  It will likely be heard in the committee tomorrow or the next day.  Notably, it kills Direct Access completely and makes Edison shareholders responsible for that portion of Edison's debt owed to suppliers.  In short, a very bad bill.
Burton's 18XX, which would de-link the bond issuance (to pay back the General Fund) from the DWR contracts is likely to pass the Senate tomorrow or the next day.  Many--including Enron--support the bill (though we are supporting it behind the scenes).

What people don't know:
Whether there's the time or the will in the Assembly and Senate to achieve by Friday a single, comprehensive bill that can be sent to the governor for his signature. 
Whether the Legislature would postpone its month-long recess if the Legislature hasn't finished a bill by Friday (most folks think they will not postpone).
Whether it's true that, irrespective of the energy issue, the Legislature will fail to get the budget completed by Friday and therefore have to postpone their recess anyway, in which case they might continue to work on the energy legislation at the same time.

Odds-makers still say it's better than 50-50 that the Legislature does not get the Edison bills done by Friday and leaves on on its 30-day vacation.

Best,
Jeff

Sacramento is one goofy place.

Now that we have the SCE bills showing that they are not going to credit past PX Credits against the T&D charges, here is the preliminary plan for challenging SCE's (and PG&E's anticipated) action.  As Diann explained, the bills begin becoming past due August 19, with late fees of 1.5% accruing thereafter.  Disconnect notices could be received 30 days thereafter, or about September 19.  Our target date for filing is Monday, August 20.  

     1.  Charley Ferguson (LeBoef Lamb) will prepare an analysis of the pro's and con's of challenging the action in federal court versus at the CPUC (considering, e.g., bias of CPUC, timing, disconnect protection, etc.).  Charley will draft alternative Complaints.   He will get the input of the bankruptcy lawyers on the draft PG&E complaint.  I will circulate these drafts as soon as they are available.

     2.  Charley will first meet with Jeanne Bennett for a "download."  After that meeting he will likely also wish to speak with Wanda and Diann for additional background information.  (Thank you for your generosity with your time.)

     3.  I will check with Sue Mara to see what, if anything, the other ESPs may be planning to do to challenge SCE's action.  Not many still have direct access customers, but some do.

     4.  I will talk to Jim Steffes about an unofficial approach to SCE.

Please let me know if I have missed anything, and I would appreciate it if you would forward this along to anyone else who you think may like to have this information.  Thanks.

Subject:	RE: CTC - Stat(EESO)

Mary lynne, thanks for the numbers.  It is exactly the information that I was hoping for.

I ran some quick totals on the data.  Here is what I saw for the commercial customers:
72,559 MWh delivered for commercial during this time period.
Total positive CTC owed to utility of $1,749,741
Average CTC for these customers of $24.11/MWh [Ruffer, Mary lynne - I provided rate class if you want to see it by rate class]   


Without opining on whether we owe these or not, I still need to figure out whether they've been booked and if so how, and as more come in we need to figure out what to do with them.  A few accounting/booking questions:
Have these been booked as a payable to PG&E [Ruffer, Mary lynne - Yes - these are being booked as payables with PG&E]    
Do we think that they can be offset against any negative ctc's that PG&E owes us. [Ruffer, Mary lynne - Enron's intent is to fight this through an invoice dispute process with the CPUC basically stating that the credit balances on these customer accounts should be put back on the utility bills and therefore we do not owe this money as well as through the bankrupcy process through recoupment.  The PG&E bankrupcy attorneys asked that Enron hold off for 48 hours in the dispute process to discuss this issue.  I have not heard the outcome of these discussions, but Jim may have heard.  ]   
Is there a clean process in place for tracking and booking these. [Ruffer, Mary lynne - We are requesting the data from Operations for this purpose. ] 
Can we do a flash vs. actual on these volumes for the time period. [Ruffer, Mary lynne - I do not know what percentage of the DA bills we have received of customers that have been dasr'd to have a feel for whether we have enough data for this comparison.  I will work with Operations and Steve Swain to see what they think we can do.]
Who has the schedule of historic negative CTC receivalbles and what the accounting treatment has been? [Ruffer, Mary lynne - I will try to get this to you today.  The accounting treatment was that we booked it as part of our Net Receivable with PG&E and SCE and took the income.]    
I think we need to prepare a "one stop shopping" binder or folder with all of the positive and negative ctc information going back through time.  Perhaps this has been done already, but I haven't seen it. [Ruffer, Mary lynne - Unless Operations has this information, I have not seen it.  I will call to discuss the specific information you are trying to capture.]    

A couple other questions / observations:
Steve, do we have any idea how they calculate this?
In September we will receive charges of approximately $14.6 million applying our load against a $24/MWh CTC.
JIm, what is our process at the CPUC to dispute these charges and clarify PG&E's methodology?
I need to get a handle on this ASAP.

Attached is the CTC file for STAT (EESO).  It is basically the same as the last file I send with EEMC data except that we pulled in the residential/commercial indicator so I could split residential out.

The attached file is the latest version, go to SUMMARY page.  I still have some finalizing to do on the format/info to present, would appreciate comments, feedback, etc.  As you will see, we have veered some from our initial task of looking at "SCE" and "PG&E" method, mainly b/c I have come to believe, based on info from Sue Mara and other sources, that SCE does not intend to eliminate the CTC -- they have merely stopped calculating it for now until they can get some guidance from CPUC.  Nevertheless, if the CTC were to be eliminated, the impact is shown in the model summary.
 
I plan to speak some with Belden as soon as he gets in tomorrow AM, and then we can proceed to talking with Whalley, et al.  Thanks....

Yesterday, we discussed that Edison is likely going to try to jerk around ESPs, QFs and generators on past due amounts under its settlement with the PUC.  Here's the latest on what they're doing to the QFs.

I listed in on this afternoon's IEP call re: SCE's MOU.

According to Smutney-Jones (who was more than average mad), SCE has reneged on the "pay 10% up front" portion of the deal they struck with SCE.  According to IEP, SCE says that the banks, who are spooked by TURN's success in getting a 14-day temporary suspension of the CPUC-SCE settlement, is not interested in allowing SCE to pay any creditors like QFs preferentially. SCE said the 5.37 c/kWh commitment is still there, however.  IEP's was also unsuccessful in getting the effective date of 5.37 c/kWh changed in return for the loss of the 10% up front.

CCC/Jerry Bloom, who represents gas-fired QFs is seperately negotiating with SCE and may be willing to give up 10% in return for commiting to 5.37c/kwh outside of the CPUC.  (They are concerned with CPUC overturning the IEP-SCE "deal.")

Several parties on the call, including CalEnergy, indicated they may sue SCE outside the CPUC over reneging on this deal.

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

Thanks very much.  I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist for Wild Goose on this one?  

Can you please let me know 1) the outcome of the meeting and 2) any actions the group intends to take.  I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.  Give me a call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.  

Finally, what information do you have about where generators and other large customers groups (i.e., CMTA, the Chamber and CLECA) are on the bill?

Best,
Jeff

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.

As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.

Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.
Few questions.

Mike,
   I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on
   behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active
   in any discussions on this bill?
   What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably,
   their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the
   bill)?
   What about large customers?  They been screaming for more
   infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not
   delivering it.
   Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or
   opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the
   electric mayhem.
   There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the
   interstates from building into the state.
   If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when
   doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and
   noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e.,
   interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want
Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more
regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill
actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Sue,
 
Attached is a draft of the Petition which can be circulated.
 
I recommend that an Alliance member join the Alliance as a Petitioner to eliminate any issue about standing.  I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
 
The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
 
I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.
 
I look forward to your comments.  EWD

Subject: Direct Access Petition


Attached please find the draft Petition for Writ of Review before the California Supreme Court.  We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning.  The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application.  If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). 
 
Enron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner.  I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity.
 
The Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted.  The Petition does not  address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review.  Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed.  Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition.  The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely.
 
Dan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.  If you need to reach me at any time my office number is (818) 596-2291, my cell number is (805) 796-2198, and my Email address is eduncan2@arterhadden.com <mailto:eduncan2@arterhadden.com>.  EWD

Good draft.  Few comments:

As much as we may not like it, the commission is where the action is right now, and we're going to have to work with them.  As such, I think the comments would be significantly more effective if you go through the document and edit out the invective and other highly charged adjectives, which, while therapeutic, tend to incent the Commission to ignore or be even more hostile to our interests. In short, I don't see an upside to it and there is downside.  Rather than try to edit, I've simply compiled those paragraphs that in my view should be deleted or require serious toning-down. In addition to these specific areas, I would recommend going through the document and toning it down generally.
Seems that it would be useful, up front and at the end, to give OUR answer (maybe I'm repeating Jim's comments here):  e.g., The Commission should 1) not do retroactive, 2) permit customers to do what the contracts permit (e.g., add facilities, renew, etc.), 3) hold hearings on all of Wood's unsubstantiated assertions, and 4) anything else we want to be part of the solution as it relates to the issues raised by Karl.
On page 2, do we run the risk of affirming  what Angelides and others are saying, i.e., that DA could bankrupt the state?  Sure we need to say it, since it seems to play into their spin and everyone already knows of the bind they're in?  Could backfire.
Point # 6 on page 14:  are  we inviting the Commission to ask parties to submit contracts?  Possible to re-write or eliminate this so that it doesn't appear we're advocating having folks submit them?

Good job.  Thanks for your efforts.  Seems that the key thing is to let the Commission know unequivocally that it must hold extensive hearings on the many factual issues in dispute.

Best,
Jeff

With respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:

Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.
Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.
Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.

We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Proposed SCE Negotiation Strategy

Following last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.

1.	Form Enron Negotiation Team

	My recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.  My understanding was that Lisa M. was the lead negotiator - I would not change this.  Jeff should only be there to make introductions.

2.	Meet & Confer (10/29)

	Sue Mara and Jeff Dasovich will listen and report back to everyone on what happens.  

3.	Reformed Stipulation

	I would propose that we take a wait and see approach to this document.  Based on Dasovich's idea to get together with SCE on Thursday, maybe let this ride.

4.	Meeting

	My understanding is that (Jeff D. please correct) SCE can meet with us this Thursday.  Can everyone make it that needs to be there?  Probably meet in California.  We should put the laundry list on the table.

Please let me know what else we need to discuss or if anyone disagrees.

Thanks,

Jim

You may recall that the last summary included SCE advice letter 1586-E.  This was the advice filing that seeksto implement a number of the regulatory components included in the October 2, 2001 Settlement Agreement between the CPUC and SCE.  The summary noted that Edison asked for comments to be due on November 28.  That request has been denied (see the attached letter), and comments are instead due on December 4.

Subject:=09CA Contracting

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

Below is the proposed "7/7" and early termination language for the current =
CA contract push.  Please review and provide me any feedback.  This languag=
e is the same as what we used in late June, with the exception that the ter=
mination date is 8-27 at 1:00 pm.  One concern I have that we need to work =
through:  In June our termination date was after the CPUC meeting but befor=
e the date we believed DA would end.  Recall that this changed upon the CPU=
C delay.  Here, it sounds like 8-23 is both the date of the meeting and the=
 date DA could end (in fact, it might even end as of some retroactive date)=
.  Thus, we have some increased risk that a regulator could decide that our=
 contract was not effective before the 23rd because of the termination righ=
t.=20

It is my understanding that we are pricing new CA deals off the master betw=
een now and 8-23, with the inclusion of this language.  There is a list of =
about 10 prospects that Lamar will be circulating later today. =20

Please send me any comments or questions.  MDS

Alan,

This is a very valid question and one which was asked by Steve Hall about 6 weeks ago.  We have been working with the ISO the get the following information.

Based on the latest information provided by the ISO Client Reps.  Enron would be eligible for receiving part of the Allocation.  There were some questions regarding this in the past because, the tariff was written in our favor to receive part of this allocation but the Settlement documentation by the ISO did not represent the same.

Per John Gooden at the ISO

The CT 1480 is used to allocate the revenues received by the ISO through CT 480.  Such revenues will be allocated to the SCs with a positive Uninstructed Demand Deviation and to those with a negative Uninstructed Demand Deviation with a magnitude less than or equal to 5% of the metered Demand.  These SCs will receive revenues based on the ratio of each SC's metered demand to the sum of all such SCs metered demand in the control area.

Chris Stokley has placed a request with the ISO to provide us with information indicating how much of this has been allocated to Enron.  If they are truly calculating this today they should not have any problems providing this information.

If you have any additional questions please let me know.

Thanks - MO

Subject:	Underscheduling Penalty--CONFIDENTIAL

The Calif. EOB has released information on the size of the FERC-approved, tracked, but-as-yet-unimplemented underscheduling penalty.

See the attached PDF file, especially the figures in the attachment at the end.

The total liability for PG&E and SCE is approaching $1billion. (EOB says that DWR is off the hook but I am not sure that is true.)

As a generally balanced SC, Enron would likely be eligible for some of these proceeds.  How the proceeds would be allocated is less than fully clear.  MURRAY O'NEIL: Have you seen anything on who would receive the revenues from this tracking A/C if it were to be billed and paid?)

Also the probability of ever extracting these $s out of noncreditworthy counter parties must be taken into account.

Alan Comnes

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.

Jim,

We can talk at greater length if you want, but the quick answers to your questions are:

1. PX Credit: Make it simple and transparent.  Best outcome would be no credit -- DA pays T&D costs only, as they appear in the tariff.  Period, end of story.
2. The UDC Financial Hole: The more relief we can get from these items, the better.  Duh.  The small surcharge ($10) is currently factored into in our curves, so the hope is that whatever ultimately emerges from the sausage factory, the ultimate amount that they try to stick on DA customers is < $10.  If our contract language ends up protecting us further, all the better, but I would prefer that not to be our last resort.

We could not do that.  On the other hand, if we advocate that it should only apply to those who directly benefitted, and the CPUC adopts that reasoning, we would be shooting our tax argument in the foot.  I think you are right that we need to understand the implications, both financially and contractually, of the options before the Commission.

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Please forward along to others I may have missed but need to know:

The Commission held a hearing this afternoon to discuss the need for hearings on issues surrounding the DA suspension.
With minor exceptions, the utilities told the Commission that the Commission didn't need to conduct hearings, and that the Commission could just go forward with implementing the suspension and assess exit fees.  
The utilities said that hearings could be held "sometime later" to determine the exact level of exit fees and how the utilities ought to calcualte the PX credit going forward.
A large group of business customers and suppliers disagreed strongly and made a very good case for hearings.
There were lengthy arguments in front of the judge, at the end of which the judge decided that it would useful to hold another prehearing conference.
The next hearing will be on Dec. 12th.
The judge wanted another hearing to permit folks to have the opportunity to respond to the first round of comments on the issues submitted by everyone last Friday.
In sum, there will be another hearing on Dec. 12th to further discuss the need for hearings prior to the Commission making decisions on these issues.
At this point, it appears that the judge is leaning toward having comprehensive hearings.
Of particular note, at the end of the hearing the judge said that he is NOT inclinded to recommend a retroactive suspension of Direct Access to July 1, and that he didnt' think that the PUC commissioner assigned to the case was either. (Worried that he said too much, he then said he couldn't/shouldn't spead for the commissioner.)
The judge, and the Commissioner who was at the hearing, went on at length abouth the fact that no one submitted their DA contracts to the PUC (as requested in the document the PUC issued asking folks to submit comments on the issues).
Our attorney and the attorneys for suppliers and customers told them that 1) the Commission didn't need to see the actual contracts to get the information necessary via hearings to decide the issues and 2) the Commission doesn't have the authority to ask to see contracts and they ain't likely going to get them without a fight.  
Though the probability many not be high, there is at least the chance that the Commission may try to subpoena folks to get the contracts.  Seems prudent to at least be prepared for the possiblity.
Interestingly, Edison made a run at getting the Commission to implement by January 1 its proposal to charge all customers--DA and bundled alike--for Edison's undercollection.  
The judge (literally) laughed off the request, and then said no.  
As a result, Edison didn't get the leverage it was hoping for prior to our follow up meeting with them tomorrow to discuss the Negative CTC issue.
The judge also gave the DWR representative a pretty good thrashing, e.g., "why are you here, you refuse to be a party, you refuse to provide info," etc.
>From today's hearing it appears that DWR will come under increasing pressure to open the kimono and have its numbers scrutinized.  
In related news, Davis has announced that he's asked Sempra to meet to renegotiate their DWR contract and said that he'd thus far met with two other generators in "serious negotitations."

Jim and Jeff --

I spoke with Brian Cragg about the Commission's adjustment of QF prices.  He
said that to date they have only done it on a going forward basis.  They did
say when they issued their decision in March which changed the formula for
QF  pricing that they were going to continue their examination of the
formula inputs and additional future changes could be made retroactive to
March.  To date they have not taken further action.

In the past, when the Commission has made changes to rates to reflect
overcollections or undercollections, they have not gone back and
recalculated each bill. The corrections are made on a going forward basis.
Thus in the case of the PX energy charge, the energy charge on customer's
future bills would be reduced to reflect the past over payments.
Conversely, the PX credit would be reduced to reflect the fact that they
were to high in the past.

Jeanne --

Not quite sure that I am getting the picture.  Let me lay it out more
directly.

The PX Credit for October 2000 was $225 based on the actual market rates.

Now FERC is saying that October 2000 hourly prices for CalPX DA and CalPX
HA markets were "too high" in June 2001.  Can the CPUC change the PX Credit
for October 2000 and make the Utilities recalculate our Negative CTC?

What is prospective?  Have they ever done this before?

   Subject:  CPUC Authority to Adjust Rates

   Jeff and Jim --

   I have done some research into the issue of whether the CPUC would be
   able
   to restate the UDC's PX Energy Charges (and thus PX Credits) back to
   October
   if the FERC were to apply its mitigation plan back that far. Thus far,
   my
   research indicates that the answer is yes (or at least there is a strong
   argument that the answer is yes) and it would not violate the rule
   against
   retroactive rate making.  The reasoning is as follows:

   The Commission (as affirmed by the courts) have ruled that they may
   subject
   a utility's rates to refund to account for adjustments made pursuant to
   a
   methodology or formula adopted before the date the utility's rates
   became
   subject to refund. Thus any ratemaking is considered prospective because
   the
   formulas are in place before the utility's rates are made subject to
   refund.
   The PX Energy Charge is calculated pursuant to the formula/mechanism set
   forth in the utility's tariffs.  These charges were always subject to
   adjustment on a prospective basis due to the settlement process.  The
   change
   in energy prices which would be effected by the FERC ruling could very
   well
   be viewed as an adjustment made pursuant to a formula.  Thus the change
   would not be considered retroactive ratemaking.

   I had a chance to talk with Mike Day for a couple of minutes about this
   issue.  He concurred with my analysis.

   Jeanne

Commissioner Wood has issued extensive questions on direct access, continuing his harassment of ESPs.  He raises the issues of moving the termination date back from September 20 and supposed cost shifting.  He also asks for copies of contracts with customers and extensive information about those contracts. Comments are due Nov 2 with replies due Nov 8.  We plan to respond aggressively through our coalition, Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM). We WILL NOT be providing any contract information.

Attached is a petition for modification of Decision 01-05-064 (the rate
design decision) filed by the Association of Bay Area Governments. The
Petition requests that the decision be modified to exempt customers which
were direct access for the period of March through May 2001 from the 12
month procurement surcharge which is designed to allow the utilities to
collect the three cent increase authorized by the March decision which then
did not go into effect until June (i.e., collect the revenues foregone due
to the time lag in implementation).

Given the fact that most of Enron's customers were on bundled service during
the March-June time frame, I do not believe that the requested modification
would provide them any benefit. Let me know if I am wrong on this and if
Enron wants to chime in  in support of ABAG's petition.

The attached memo discusses the conference call that was held today to discuss how best to present to FERC for its approval the proposal that the  Official Committee of PX Participant Creditors developed in the PX bankruptcy proceeding.  The Plan is a broad proposal that deals with all remaining issues related to the PX's wind-up, including the return of the collateral.

Edison has dripped out information over the last 48 hours that reveals what the team had anticipated for some time:

Edison will pay ESPs what they are owed w.r.t. the negative CTC when they pay everyone else ("sometime in Q1'02").
However, Edison has told us and will tell ESPs today that they intend to very aggressively push the PUC to charge DA customers for "their fair share of the PX credit," since in their view DA customers (through the negative CTC) "contributed to the undercollection no more and no less than bundled customers did." 
They claim they are "on the side of the angels" because it is an "equity" issue, and that allowing DA not to pay would be a massive "jailbreak."
Their calculation is simple:  If DA represents 10% of the load, then DA is responsible for paying down 10% of the undercollection.
Edison wants the undercollection recovered over the period of its settlement (they claim that, based on their calculations, they can recover it over 2 years).
In short, Edison is zero-ing out payables tied to negative CTC by forcing ESPs/DA customers to pay it back through rates over the next two years.
In a conversation yesterday, Edison said that it is not attempting to link the two.  That is, they are not making payment of PX-credit-related debt on agreement by ESPs to pay a portion of Edison's undercollection through rates over the next two years.
Presumably, in this way, Edison can say, "We said that we would pay our creditors, and we did.  It was the PUC who sets the rates and decided to claw back by charging ESPs/DA customers as part of the normal course of fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities." 

Implications
Clearly negative from the perspective of expeditiously recognizing earnings for amounts Edison says it will pay us when it pays everyone else in Q1.
Equally important, it may increase significantly the risk of recognizing earnings for what PG&E will pay us.  If the PUC addresses whether ESPs/DA customers should contribute to pay down Edison's undercollection, it will likely also want to address the issue for PG&E.  We need to discuss the extent to which the PUC can meddle with PG&E in this regard given that PG&E is pursuing its work out through bankruptcy.

Impact on tomorrow's meeting:
I still think it is constructive to meet face-to-face with Edison tomorrow, but wanted to give folks the option of doing it by conference call:
We still have to determine whether we have agreement on what they owe us.  This includes calculations up to Jan. 17; the period from Jan. 17 to when we put our customers back on bundled service; and the period since they've been returned to DA status.
Since Edison claims they will pay everyone at the same time--sometime in Q1'02--there seems to be some value in determining what that number is, and getting the agreement in writing.
Second, it would be useful to explore with Edison why they have chosen to take an extreme, hardball stance on the issue (given that the PX Credit issues represents about $243MM/~$6B = 4-5% of the total debt).
In addition, it would be useful to let Edison know that they are in for a very long, protracted litigation struggle if, once they've paid us, they attempt to take it back through ratemaking shenanigans at the PUC.  
In yesterday's conversation with Fielder, I told him that Edison is ensuring World War 3 and that they'd better prepare for it if they intend to pursue this unreasonable approach. However, I tried to keep things as cordial as possible in an effort not to close down communications altogether.
Other ESPs and DA customers are likely to oppose Edison's proposal.  Sue's informing the ARM coalition of what Edison's up to.

Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill for awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did the best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amounts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rush now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King
probably belong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities contact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to see a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor's office.

Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give them direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legislation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.

Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard back.

Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be affected by the Aug. 24th date?

Having failed to resolve either the budget or the energy issues, the Legislature is likely to postpone its recess and work through the weekend, at a minimum.
In sum, though many claim that the Legislature will "vote for something," it still doesn't appear that the "something" will include a measure that will keep Edison out of bankruptcy.
The Senate and Assembly remain extremely far apart in their approaches to amending the Governor's original MOU (which is dead).
The ranks of politicians that view bankruptcy as the best alternative is growing.


In the Senate:
SB18XX---Bill to de-link the bonds from the DWR Contracts
In the only bipartisan move to date, SB18XX passed out of two committees yesterday, but has not yet been voted on by the full Senate.  
The bill de-links payment of the bonds needed to backfill the state budget from payment of DWR contracts.
The bill is being driven by increasing concerns over the volume and price of the DWR contracts.
The DWR contracts are being held up as the reason California must suspend, or end, Direct Access.
Republicans on the Assembly side are supportive of 18, but Hertzberg--the Speaker--has joined with the Governor's people in the view that the bill would impair the contracts, consititute a breach, and expose the State to substantial damages.
As a result, when the bill passes the Senate and gets over to the Assembly, its chances of passage there are low.
SB72XX---The Senate's MOU
The Senate's version of the MOU--SB72XX--limped out of its final committee yesterday before going to a vote by the full Senate, but its chances of passing the full Senate at this point are 50-50.
The problem is that many democrats believe they will be attacked for voting for a bill that will likely drive Edison into bankruptcy, while many other democrats fear it will look like they bailed out Edison----the courage and leadership is awesome.

In the Assembly:
The Assembly two versions of the MOU---AB 82XX and AB 83 XX (now AB 50XX)
The Assembly is severely divided over how to address the energy issue.
The Speaker is having a very difficult time getting democrats to support his own bill (82XX).
Many moderate democrats support a bipartisan bill developed by a democrat (Rod Wright), who has broken ranks with Repbublicans, and Assembly Republicans.
In the end, the Speaker's bill is likely to prevail.
Things are complicated by the fact that the Assembly is having a very difficult time getting a budget passed.
As noted above, the Assembly democractic leadership opposes SB 18XX and is trying to cobble together an alternative to 18.

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Sue,
 
Attached is a draft of the Petition which can be circulated.
 
I recommend that an Alliance member join the Alliance as a Petitioner to eliminate any issue about standing.  I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
 
The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
 
I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.
 
I look forward to your comments.  EWD

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable "HC" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its "Est RT$".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the "HC" or  "Est RT$"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

Here's the draft ad.  Edelman is finishing up getting approvals from all the
organizations listed, so please don't send this anywhere as a final product
until we've talked.  Once you have approved the ad and the signatories are
finalized, the graphics firm will send the ad directly to the
papers--several of the papers have special digital software that must be
used when forwarding ads--email doesn't work.

In all cases the copy deadline is tomorrow morning (deadlines on the grid I
sent earlier)

Looking forward to talking with you.

Subject:	RE: Negative CTC Issues

On point #1 - I think that at the end of the day, FERC will not deal with the Negative CTC directly.  All they will do is reset prices.  The Utilities and the CPUC will then have to decide the legality and the equity of modifying the PX Credit and hence the Negative CTC.  We have tried in the CA Refund process to highlight the fact that much of the "high" prices were due to inappropriate policy and actions of the CPUC, Governor, and Utilities.  The core problem with this line of argument is that the Refund process didn't ask the first question - what or who is to blame.  It simply took dysfunction and ran.  We are trying in the context of the Rehearing case to ask FERC to restart with the right question.  Also, remember that we aren't going to have a solution in the FERC case until sometime next year, probably after SCE gets its money.  Finally, I think that the right policy decision is not to "re-bill" Negative CTC but rather to prospectively recover the costs.

On point #2 - See point above.  I doubt, however, that all "high" prices can be seen as just a result of underscheduling.

Two questions:

    1.  How do we fight the notion that a FERC retroactive determination of "just and reasonable rates" should be re-injected into the calculation of negative CTCs?  It seems to me that there are at least equitable arguments against that.  Will this be a CPUC or FERC issue?

    2.  Can we use the utilities' underscheduling to push them back on this, legally or in negotiations?   Since they contributed to the market disfunction, shouldn't they have to live with the consequences?

On Friday (October 19), DWR released a revised revenue requirement.  The
result was to lower the Customer Revenue Requirement by$2.4 billion from the
revenue requirement submitted on August 7th.  The stated reasons for the
change are:

1. Reduction in Gas Prices.     For example, the August estimate included a
fourth quarter 2001 gas price forecast of $7.68 at the Southern California
border.  In the recent submittal, this was reduced to $3.54.

2.  Change in Load because of Direct Access.  As a result of the Commission
delaying the suspension date from July 1 to September 20th there was a
significant bump up in DA load, thus reducing the load fo which DWR must
buy.  For example, the August submittal contained an estimate of 448 GWh in
the fourth quarter 2001 for direct access load.  The October 19th submittal
factored in a direct access load of 6,571 Gwh for fourth quarter 2001.

3.  Changes in Forecast due to DSM.  DWR has decided not to engage in any
demand side and demand bidding programs and has deferred decision on whether
to reinstitute the 20/20 program next summer.  The result of these decisions
was a decrease of $513 million in the revenue requirement, while also
increasing the load that DWR must buy for by 1896 Gwhs.

4.  Changes to Contracted for Power.  An additional 156 MW (which is
expected to be available to meet summer 2002 peak) has been contracted for
since the August 7th submittal.

5.  Adjustments to the calculations of ancillary services costs.

6. Changes in Debt Dervices Costs.  For example, on October 11 (the day
after the Commission rejected the rate agreement), the interest rate on the
interim financing went up from .75% to  2.75%.

7.  Changes in Receipt of Funds from UDCs.  Until the rate agreement between
the Commission and DWR is approved, the UDCs have been withholding on the
remittance of DWR's share the revenue receive from the sales of the UDCs own
volumes.


If any one would like a copy of DWR's entire submittal, let me know.

I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.  Few questions.

Mike, 
I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill?
What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)?
What about large customers?  They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it.
Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem.
There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state.
If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state?

Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.

Thanks again for the heads up.

Best,
Jeff

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.

This was filed on 11/09/01. Enron is not a named party -- just as part of the retail alliance.  AReM sent out a press release today, which is also attached.  AReM and others, including some of Enron's customers, appealed to the Supreme Court to seek reinstatement of direct access becuase of legal errors made by the CPUC.  Commonwealth, another ESP, also filed an appeal on broader issues.  I will keep you apprised of progress.

Subject: Direct Access Petition


Attached please find the draft Petition for Writ of Review before the California Supreme Court.  We are currently working on the Memorandum of Points and Authorities and anticipate sending a draft sometime tomorrow morning.  The Petition is based on the assumption that the Commission will adopt an order with retroactive application.  If the Commissions issues an Order consistent with the draft Interim Decision published today, then retroactivity will not be an issue and there wll be no need to seek judicial relief (at least on that ground). 
 
Enron Energy Services, Inc., is named as the Petitioner.  I am uncertain, however, whether this is the correct name or entity.
 
The Petition must be filed in the Supreme Court because the Legislature conferred exclusive and original jurisdiction on it when Public Utilities Code section 1768 was enacted.  The Petition does not  address the timeliness of the request for Supreme Court review.  Generally, all administrative remedies must be exhausted before a Petition is timely and Section 1768 appears to require that an application for rehearing be denied before a Petition can be filed.  Since there will undoubtedly be an argument that the Petition is premature because there has been no application for a rehearing, the Points and Authorities (and probably the Petition) will discuss the timeliness of the Petition.  The exceptions to the exhaustion doctrine should control making the Petition timely.
 
Dan Douglass and I will be available for your 1 p.m. conference call.  If you need to reach me at any time my office number is (818) 596-2291, my cell number is (805) 796-2198, and my Email address is eduncan2@arterhadden.com <mailto:eduncan2@arterhadden.com>.  EWD

Here is the discovery we tried to send out last week.  The people on  the A list (attachment A) are the ones to whom the non-ISO discovery is  directed.
I've made all the changes to the e-mail list that I received this morning  --I think.  If you send names, please indicate whether they are destined  for the e-mail list or the restricted service list.  Although we have ended  up as custodians of both (at least until we file the request for a restricted  service list) we'd really like to avoid mixing up the names.

As I mentioned previously, ARM is supporting the SCE approach which does not charge DA customers for the 1 cent.  ARM is working with the Energy Div staff to get a favorable ruling on it.  We decided that approach had the highest probability of success.  But ARM will seek to change the earlier order charging DA if this approach doesn't work. 

 I have not really talked to other ARM members on the PX Credit balances.  I can if you like.  I believe we should follow the requirements in our tariff and ESP/UDC agreement for a dispute as the best first step.

Sue,

Any information about whether ARM plans to challenge the passthrough of this?  Also, on a separate subject, are there any plans to challenge PG&E's and SCE's removing our PX Credit balances from customer's bills?

We need to start figuring out as soon as possible:
What we want to accomplish at the hearing.
What our posture/message will be.
What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond.
What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond.
How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference.
How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations)

Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.  Please let me know if this works for everyone.  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

I spoke to Robert Flemming who is Boeing's lobbyist.  He has been instructed
by his client to work on the issue so I told him he needs to have his client
contact the Administration directly and push for the September 1 date.  He
also indicated that he is going talk to Los Angeles area legislators who are
directly affected by Boeing's business and recommend that they push for a
date change.

I also spoke to Wal Mart's lobbyist Barry Brokaw.  Wal Mart has discussed
the issue with him but has not instructed him to work on it.  He can not
proceed until he receives direction from the client.

Thanks, Jeanne.

Just to be clear (since we had a bit of a different take last Friday in the meeting that Jim and Sue and I had with Mike).  Mike's take was that we'd be addressing just about everything under the sun, including why we think that hearings are necessary.  This takes a much narrower approach.  Just want to make sure that we're all on the same page.  I understand that Mike was travelling yesterday and the first part of today.  Likely makes sense to have a call this PM to make sure out ducks are all in a line.  Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.

1.  I'll take our case over theirs any day.

2.  I suggest that, if appropriate, we offer to relinquish our claims to this money as part of the FERC settlement in lieu of actually writing a check to California.

Subject:	Underscheduling Penalty--CONFIDENTIAL

The Calif. EOB has released information on the size of the FERC-approved, tracked, but-as-yet-unimplemented underscheduling penalty.

See the attached PDF file, especially the figures in the attachment at the end.

The total liability for PG&E and SCE is approaching $1billion. (EOB says that DWR is off the hook but I am not sure that is true.)

As a generally balanced SC, Enron would likely be eligible for some of these proceeds.  How the proceeds would be allocated is less than fully clear.  MURRAY O'NEIL: Have you seen anything on who would receive the revenues from this tracking A/C if it were to be billed and paid?)

Also the probability of ever extracting these $s out of noncreditworthy counter parties must be taken into account.

Attached for your review and comment is a second draft of tomorrow's comments on the Wood ACR.  I have added a significantly expanded section dealing with how the Commission's inaction and subsequent action contributed to the flow of customers back and forth between DA and bundled service.  My thanks to Aaron Thomas for his assistance on this section.
 
Also, I have deleted the "CYA - not the California Youth Authority" quip --  I had to have some fun while writing this on Halloween night!

Rick:
Based on your voicemail, here's a quick-and-dirty synopsis of a proposal that I've been quietly discussing with a select few out here in California (e.g., John White, large customers).  It could include more bells and whistles, but the intent of this proposal is to get DA back as soon as possible.
**************************************************************************

Reduce DWR L-T contract volumes by at least 33-50%
To "back fill" increase in net-short created by contract reformation, permit noncore customers (20 KW and above) to elect to go DA to fill the position
DA provides a significantly more efficient hedge against price volatility than DWR contracts
Election is first-come, first-serve, capped at the aggregate net short position
Customers decision to go DA will constitute a 3-year commitment to stay DA (i.e., can't go back to IOU for 3 yrs; must stay in the market)
If a net short position remains after noncore customers have elected DA (i.e., not enough elect to fill the net short), then the IOUs will hold an auction to fill the net short
The auction would seek a portfolio of 3 month, 6 month, 1 year and 3 year deals (both peak and off-peak) to fill the net short.
Noncore customers choosing DA would not escape costs of DWR power consumed when the customer was receiving utility service (i.e., prior to electing DA)
Likewise, if the noncore customers choosing DA was a utility customer during the period when the utility accured its "undercollection," (i.e., when wholesale prices exceeded the retail cap), the customer would not escape those costs by virtue of electing DA status
Noncore customers would not bear responsibility for recovery of DWR L-T contracts.
Potential add-on to deal:  Core customers (less than 20 KW) could choose "green only" DA, but, like, noncore customers could not escape costs for which they are responsible.

CAISO is continuing to make these adjustments, which are basically meter corrections and approved scheduling coordinator disputes, for prior periods.  These will probably continue for a few more months because of the recent FERC ruling regarding refunds.
Please feel free to call Don Deach (626-685-9876), Rachel Axelrad (626-685-9843) or Clark Cheng (626-685-9846) with any questions.
Thank You.

The FERC apparently has a very short memory:


1.	In its Dec. 15, 2000 Order, FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with FERC.   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov. 1 through April 26 are subject to refund?  The Dec. 15 Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability.  Otherwise, refund potential for transactions over $150/MWh would close after 60 days.  Presumably, liability for transactions under $150/MWh would close after 60 days, too.

Here is the excerpt from the Dec. 15 Order:

"We clarify that, unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the Commission.  The institution of a 60-day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff."  Dec. 15 Order at 58.


2.  	In its Nov. 1 Order, FERC said that it would limit refund liability to seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs---much less opportunity costs---to offset potential refunds.

>From the Nov. 1 Order:  "However, should we find it necessary to order refunds, we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs."  Nov. 1 Order at 39.


FERC's July 25 Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding.  Arbitrary and capricious, anyone?

I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.  If PG&E reduces going-forward procurement costs to reflect FERC-ordered refunds, I do not understand why it would affect already-issued CTC charges.  The cost of power would be cheaper going forward.

Thanks for the thoughts.  I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.

On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to "collect" the overpayment of Negative CTC.

All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.

I assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable "HC" in the formula laid out in the attachment.

It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its "Est RT$".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.

My comments are:

The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the "HC" or  "Est RT$"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.

Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  

Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.

Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).  We continue to try and get a handle on how the FERC Refund case will impact the PX Credit and Negative CTC.  If anyone has any issues or comments, please let me know.

Jim,

I would think you need to get Tim Belton and Wes Colwell comfortable with any proposal to settle with SCE.   "Final" invoices have been received for ISO settlements for the months of December and January.  However, I believe the ISO can continue to make changes to these months, if they chose to.  I do not have an issue with the below, however, these should be the easiest months to settle as there is little disagreement re this period  (FERC refund case is the only outstanding issue).  I would want to get some understanding of what they will support for the period beginning January 19, 2001.  

Please consider something like this for the pro-ration language:
The utility bills for the month of January should be  bifurcated into two periods, days on or before January 18th and the days after January 18th.   Prorating or allocating the bill cycle for January would be incorrect.  I believe SCE actually calculates a daily rate, and therefore it would be appropriate to only pro-rate volumes, but not rate.  

Call to discuss. 

Wanda

Wanda --

Who do I need to call at EPMI West Power to discuss the following -

We are considering proposing a Settlement for SCE.  The language we are considering on the Negative CTC is as follows.  Does this help or hurt?  Do we have "final ISO invoices"?  

Please call me.

Please note this PG&E Motion seeking to defer a the DWR financing order and
related orders impementing a rate agreement between DWR and the commission,
but not the direct access suspension order, because the State Treasurer has
told the financial markets that the state has enough money to pay for the
energy purchase program even without any bond repayment revenue this year.
the same logic should apply as to the direct access suspension program if
the bond revenue is not critical to the state this year.  We should
disseminate this information to the direct access coalition, particularly
the Treasurer's statement, and use it to advocate the Comm. Brown defer the
direct access suspension or support the Bilas alternative.  We could also
consider a parallel motion seeking to delay a direct access suspension for
the same reasons, but it would likely be more effective if this motion were
to come directly from a source other than Enron.

The Commission issued a draft decision yesterday (September 4) on DWR's
revenue requirement.  While the Commission had been scheduled to vote on the
revenue requirement at tomorrow's (September 6) meeting, the vote has been
postponed to allow for comments on the PD.  Comments are due on September
11th.  Cmmr. Lynch stated at her press conference held today that it  was
her intent to vote on the PD no later than the next regularly scheduled
Commission meeting on September 20th, and perhaps earlier if a continuation
meeting can be scheduled.


The PD approves the entirety of DWR's requested revenue requirement of $12.6
less the costs of certain demand side management programs which are not
included as "authorized costs" under AB1X.  The PD does not follow DWR's
approach of a pro rata allocation of the revenue requirement among the three
UDCs.  Rather the PD follows a "cost of service" approach.  The PD allocates
DWR's energy procurement costs on a geographic basis, depending on whether
the energy is delivered over facilities in northern California or Southern
California (Transmission Path 15 is the line of demarcation).  Energy
sources procured north of Path 15 are allocated to PG&E customers and those
procured south of Path 15 are allocated to SCE and SDG&E customers.  The
result of such allocation is to have 54% of DWR costs allocated to PG&E, 33%
to SCE and 13% to SDG&E.  Each of the UDCs are then allocated the same
percentage of bond proceeds.  In revenue requirement terms this means that
for the period of January 17, 2001 through December 31, 2002, PG&E is
allocated $6.53 billion; SCE is allocated $4.01 billion and SDG&E is
allocated $1.53 billion.

Along with the revenue requirement allocation, the PD adopts a DWR charge
for each UDC.  The UDCs are directed to begin dispersing payment to DWR
based on the relevant DWR charge for each kWh sold by DWR to the UDC's
customer.  For PG&E this charge is 13.99 cents/ kWh; for SCE the charge is
10.03 cents/kWh; and for SDG&E the charge is 9.02 cents/kWh.  The PD also
notes that given the fact that PG&E's DWR charge is  !3.99 cents it may need
to remit to DWR an additional 4  cents for each kWh that was provided to its
customers by DWR since June 1 until this order becomes effective.

As for the necessity of raising PG&E and SCE rates to account for the DWR
revenue requirement, the PD states that such a determination cannot be made
until a decision on the revenue requirement for the UDCs' retained
generation is issued.  That proposed  decision is due out later this month.



If you have any questions or would like a copy of the order, please contact
me.

Jeff will be talking to Fielder on this.

SCE said at our meeting Monday that they DID NOT want to talk about these issues at the PHC -- they wanted to address it through the advice letters. This one shouldn't even be up an issue at all.

Hi Sue,

I'm sure you will agree that this is one of those issues that will be
discussed at the PHC.  Since the UDCs have been ordered to verify that DA
customers entered into contracts by the 9/20/01 suspension date, SCE is
using the 10/5/01 cutoff date to fulfill that requirement. Regarding the
UC/CSU system, they are on the list Enron provided by the 10/5/01 deadline.

Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.
As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned
that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of
customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether
D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access
services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to
refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20
contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states
otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process
DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or
before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities
or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are
submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it
clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent
Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they
could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before
September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language
providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on
October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is
crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or
before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which
you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting
held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs
agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list
by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and
facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure
the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do
this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.
Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D
01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails
supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is
in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on
rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

Diann,

I received your attached customer list dated 11/1/01, however, per the
attached note sent to you on 10/03/01, SCE's deadline to submit a
certified
customer list was 10/5/2001. SCE will use the list you submitted on
10/5/01
@ 3:58pm (attached below) as your certified list.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct
access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC
order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or
verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or
366.5, after September 20, 2001, is prohibited" (Ordering
             Paragraph No. 4).

             and,

            "PG&E, SCE and SDG&E shall not accept any direct access
service
requests [DASRs] for any contracts executed
             or agreements entered into after September 20, 2001."
(Ordering Paragraph No. 7).

In order to comply with the CPUC order please provide Southern
California
Edison with a certified list of your direct access customers that have
written contracts or agreements executed on or before September 20,
2001,
for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.  This list may be subject
to
verification in the future, therefore, please be prepared to produce
evidence of these contracts or agreements upon request. The following
information must be included for each customer on this list for your
DASR
to be eligible for future processing:

Please include the following information for each customer on this list:

     ?    Customer Name
     ?    Service Account Number
     ?    Service Address
     ?    Contract Date

This list should be sent via e-mail to Sheila Advani at
Sheila.Advani@sce.com, no later than
     5:00 p.m. Pacific Daylight Savings Time, Monday, September 24, 2001

For those direct access customers that have certified contracts or
verified
agreements executed on or before September 20, 2001, ESPs must submit
the
respective "connect" Direct Access Service Requests (DASRs) within 30
calendar days following the effective date of the order.  All "connect"
DASRs submitted for accounts, which are not on the ESP's certified list,
will be rejected or canceled.  SCE will not process any "connect" DASRs
after 5:00 p.m., October 20, 2001.  SCE will continue to accept
"disconnect" and "update" DASRs (for changes to billing and/or metering
options) for existing Direct Access customers.

If you have any questions, please contact your Account Manager.

Privileged and Confidential=20

Lisa and Michael,

I  talked with two representatives from PG&E today, Robert Orbeta and Fong =
Wan, regarding the reconciliation of amounts included in Enron's Proof Of C=
laim, which total almost $404 million dollars,  to the books and records of=
 PG&E.  Both Robert and Fong agree that 1) no significant differences have =
been found, 2) the total variance, including IBM,  is approximately $2 mill=
ion dollars, and 3) the reconciliation is substantially complete and theref=
ore, the results should not change materially.  Diann Huddleson will call h=
er counterpart, Mike Alexander,  this afternoon to request a schedule, by a=
ccount, of these variances.  As you know, Enron's Proof of Claim is a compi=
lation of charges/credits reflected on PG&E invoices, and therefore, the on=
ly differences should have been the result of omissions, duplications, or o=
ther query failures.  All things being equal, the reconciliation should hav=
e been a simple comparison, but at an account level.  The sheer number of a=
ccounts for several months of activity,  made this reconciliation a challen=
ge.=20

Both Robert and Fong made remarks regarding Enron's claim for the IBM dual =
bill accounts.  Mr.  Fong also commented that another outstanding item, in =
his opinion, was the "FERC refund case".   I suggested that these items be =
included on the agenda for the settlement discussions scheduled for next we=
ek.=20

Let me know if you need anything further.=20

Thanks,
Wanda

ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATION

Below is the proposed "7/7" and early termination language for the current =
CA contract push.  Please review and provide me any feedback.  This languag=
e is the same as what we used in late June, with the exception that the ter=
mination date is 8-27 at 1:00 pm.  One concern I have that we need to work =
through:  In June our termination date was after the CPUC meeting but befor=
e the date we believed DA would end.  Recall that this changed upon the CPU=
C delay.  Here, it sounds like 8-23 is both the date of the meeting and the=
 date DA could end (in fact, it might even end as of some retroactive date)=
.  Thus, we have some increased risk that a regulator could decide that our=
 contract was not effective before the 23rd because of the termination righ=
t.=20

It is my understanding that we are pricing new CA deals off the master betw=
een now and 8-23, with the inclusion of this language.  There is a list of =
about 10 prospects that Lamar will be circulating later today. =20

Please send me any comments or questions.  MDS

i talked to david fleisig at pg&e last night. he begged for simple term sheet that could be flushed out in definitive documentation.
would you add the following for people to comment on in the term sheet:
we will oppose the assessment of an underscheduling penalty at the ferc.
they will oppose the assessment of any surcharge to da customers by the cpuc for any of their undercollections.
we will both cooperate to either get ferc alj approval of the settlement or if we waive this requirement in our discretion (e.g. if some holdup there/we want to close fast), they will immediately pay to us any refund that we end up paying that goes to them.

Not necessarily for purposes of discussion on the SCE call, but for later
reference if we have to fight SCE over the justification for their crediting
proposal, I want to chime in with my critique of SCE's analysis.

First of all, their example does not properly characterize the obligations
of the direct access customers.  A Direct access customer (with the same
hypothetical load as in the SCE example) did not pay the same $60 toward
SCE's procurement costs and transition recovery, they paid a lesser sum, $60
minus the actual PX costs for that billing cycle.  What the direct access
customer paid (assuming the PX costs were $30), was a contribution directly
to CTC transition cost recovery, in this case $30.

When the price of energy exceeded the 6 cents in bundled rates for
procurement and transition cost recovery, the utility does begin to build an
undercollection from its bundled customers, and the entire $80
undercollection in the SCE example relates to the cost of power purchased
for the bundled customer but not recovered in rates.

The same is NOT TRUE for the direct access customer.  The negative credit
provided to the direct access customer is the same as the underrecovery from
the bundled service customer, in this case $80.  However, for the direct
access customer, this amount has nothing to do with power purchased by the
utility for the DA customer, and represents essentially a credit against
amounts overpaid toward the utility's CTC recovery in earlier periods.

This is one of the many perverse effects of the residual CTC collection
mechanism.  If a fixed CTC contribution had been established from Day 1,
direct access customers could have continued to pay that fixed contribution,
also pay their $40 share of the utility T&D costs, and would not have had
any role in creating the utility's undercollection.  However, because the
CTC calculation was a residual calculation:  the generation component of the
frozen rates less the actual PX costs = CTC (which later became negative)
direct access customers' contribution to CTC was dependent on the utility's
procurement risk in the market compared to the generation component in
frozen rates.  This was also consistent with the notion contained in AB 1890
and the Edison MOU that the utility bore the risk of power price volatility
in recovering its CTC.

In order for direct access customers to contribute to CTC symmetrically with
bundled customers, when bundled customers no longer contributed to CTC
(because of high power costs) and in fact REDUCED the CTC collected (the
power cost undercollection was to have been paid first before CTC was
booked, but the PUC did not properly account for this until it adopted the
TURN accounting adjustment), then the CTC contribution of direct access
customers had to be proportionately reduced, and that is the function of the
negative CTC credit.

Thus, a reduction in the CTC contribution of direct access customers to
ensure they paid the same proportionate share of CTC as bundled customers is
NOT a matter which SCE is entitled to recover after the fact because they
sustained an undercollection of power costs.  The undercollection of power
costs was entirely their risk, and direct access customers paid their fair
share of CTC and that is all they had to pay, period.  The fact that they
paid less than SCE expected because the high power costs generated a lot of
negative CTC credits at the end of the transition period is one more risk
that the utilities assumed when they selfishly and foolishly promoted a
residual CTC calculation instead of a fixed transition cost recovery system
as was used in most other states.  SCE is entitled to NO recovery of its
undercollection from direct access customers.

As you can tell, I am more than willing to discuss this ad infinitum.  If
you have questions, please call or email.

Subject: Sue's Retort to SCE's Premise
Importance: High


I don't agree Edison's premise -- that "direct access customers
contributed just as much to SCE's procurement costs undercollection as
bundled service customers." We need to make clear that we don't buy in
to their rhetoric.

Here's my reasoning.

DA Customers are completely different from bundled customers. SCE had to
buy power to serve the bundled load.  SCE did not buy power for DA
customers.  SCE's purchases of the power to serve the bundled load
coupled with high wholesale prices and an inability to raise rates was
the direct reason for the undercollection. I can make the argument that
the undercollection is SOLELY related to BUNDLED SERVICE.

There are two big reasons that back me up: AB 1890 and Top-down rates.
I will explain.  The utilities got what they wanted out of AB 1890 --
payments of $30 plus billion in so-called stranded costs and a real
delay in any competitive retail market until their costs were paid off.
One of the tradeoffs, however, was that the utilities were at risk FOR
HIGH PRICES in the WHOLESALE MARKET.  Everyone understood that if there
were high gas prices or bad hydro years, the utilities would be squeezed
and not collect their billions by the 3/31/01 deadline. That's the risk
they agreed to.  Now, they are claiming that they were ENTITLED to that
money and more.  This is in direct conflict with the statute. I can make
the argument that the statute requires SCE to assume this risk and
therefore any undercollection is theirs alone -- now the CPUC can bail
them out -- but that doesn't make ESPs subject to any presumed
"undercollection."

Now to the rates.  At the beginning of DA, the utilities did not want to
do a real rate case and separate the costs of the wholesale business and
the retail busness from T&D. So, they did a "top-down" calculation.
This meant that there had to be a "credit" put on the bills of DA
customers to account for the costs the utility avoided by having the
customers switch to DA. So, the PX Credit structure was a direct result
of the utilities unwillingness to unbundle specific components of the
rates.  Next, although bundled customers rates were capped, the
decisions from the CPUC made it clear that there was no similar cap for
DA customers -- their rates and bills would be whatever was charged by
their ESPs.  However, when the utilities filed their tariffs with the
CPUC, they added a cap for the PX credit that was neither proposed nor
authorized by the Commission.  Enron attacked it, but got nowhere, until
WPTF and Enron brought it up in the 1998 RAP Proceeding. Our argument
was that the bundled rates were capped but not the bills of DA customers
-- and the credit was supposed to represent the full costs the utilities
avoided by not serving DA customers.  We argued that anything less is
fundamentally unfair and anticomeptitive.  The utilities must have
thought we had a good case, because they agreed to settle. The
settlement was accepted by the Commission in the proceeding. Everyone
understood that eliminating the cap on the PX Credit was primarily to
allow the PX Credit to FLOAT ABOVE THE CAP when wholesale prices were
high. So, we have a legal right to receive the full PX Credit/Negative
CTC which is separate and distinct from any undercollection associated
with bundled customers. It seems as if we should be able to prosecute
this legal right. (keeping in mind I am not an attorney)

In summary, we have leverage and should use it.

Sue

One final note on a separate topic:
A number of parties have expressed concern about submitting work papers and other supporting evidence with respect to ripple claims.  The TFG Steering Committee has suggested to its members that ripple claim testimony contain aggregate refund numbers, instead of naming individual sellers, at this stage in the proceeding.  By filing supporting documents which identify specific sellers (even if made "confidential" under the protective order) for all our transactions in the refund exposure period, group members will essentially be releasing much of the information that was originally placed only in the hands of the Judge and FERC staff.  As noted in an earlier email, Dan Watkiss will be seeking approval of Judge Cintron to allow parties to file supporting evidence of ripple claims under seal to FERC staff and to the Judge.

First cut response to Jim's message - see below.  Please respond to me ASAP.

ISSUE:  Enron's PX credits with SCE of $---- million may be "stranded" if a PUC proposed decision is approved, as is expected to occur Thursday, June 28.

SCE stopped making PX credit payments January 5, 2001, supposedly because of its financial situation.  SCE asked the PUC for authority to reflect the accumulated credits on the customer's bill, and suspend any cash payments of such credits  The proposed decision grants this request.

SCE has also asked the PUC to formally clarify the manner in which PX credits are calculated.  Prior to January 19, 2001, the PX credit was based on the actual Power Exchange clearing prices.  On January 19, 2001, the Power Exchange effectively stopped operations.  SCE's proposal is to determine the PX credit post-January 19, 2001 as the weighted average of its own retained generation and QF contract costs.  The PUC has not yet said when it would rule on this issue.  Enron's position before the PUC is that the credit should continue to be based on a market measure, like NP 15 and SP 15 indices.

Enron's P X credits with SCE could become "stranded" if they are interpreted to accrue to the account of the individual customers receiving service and not Enron.   Once Enron's customers were re-sourced back to the utility, new account numbers were established for these accounts.  This creates a loophole which allows SCE and the PUC to interpret the accumulated credits as applying to specific customer accounts and not to services purchased by Enron. 

Core Issues for a settlement with SCE on PX credit issue:

Cash payment of owed PX credits through January 18, 2001.  (For Enron, this is $123 million.)

Agreement to use SCE-proposed method of PX credit calculation starting January 19, 2001.  (Enron drops market proposal.)

PX credits accrued starting January 19, 2001 can be paid in the form of bill credits to any account so designated by the Energy Service Provider for receipt of such credits.  (Enron credits are transferable to services rendered for other Enron customers.)
 
Other SCE debts (????) are not called in immediately.

Harry & Sue --

Please work with Mike Day on Monday am to develop the following -

1.	Outline of a proposed SCE - Enron - WPTF Stipulation that resolves SCE's request for suspension of payment of PX Credit.
2.	Talking points for Jeff Skilling to call Bryson to discuss.

Get these to Skilling through Rick early Monday so that he can call.  Skilling is going to try and convince SCE to settle and not let the CPUC decide this issue.

I know it's a long-shot on getting a deal done and before the CPUC on Wednesday, but this may be our last best hope to hold this element of the Proposed Decision.

Call me on Monday am to discuss (I'll be in DC).

Thanks,

Jim

Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
"free-for-all" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding --
the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

In our litigation meeting last Tuesday, we learned that netting of spot purchases and sales is of paramount importance in limiting our exposure to refunds, under the FERC's July 26 Order, in both the California and Pacific Northwest proceedings.  However, in the California proceeding we are also afforded the opportunity in the Order to offset our receivables against any refund that would otherwise have to be paid by us.  Also, to the extent that our receivables exceed the refund amount, the Order provides for payment of interest to us in accordance with CFR Section 35.19a.  

At present, I am aware of the existence of three receivables.  As you will recall, I mentioned at Tuesday's meeting that we should be able to treat as a receivable for purposes of offset, the revenues due us from the application of the CAISO underscheduling penalty.  I communicated the possibility of offsetting this receivable against any potential refund at this mornings Western Wholesale conference call, and subsequent research conducted by Alan Comnes indicates that the CAISO owes us $30MM, as per the CAISO's own numbers.

The CAISO also owes us approximately $40MM due to nonpayment for one to two months of business.  These two figures alone, totalling approximately $70MM, exceed the estimate of our potential exposure in the California proceeding.

Finally, the negative CTC issue is another receivable due us by IOU's that, under the plain language of the Order, could potentially be used to offset any refund amount.  I am not aware of the magnitude of this receivable but do understand that there are some sensitivities regarding this issue, including concerns about revealing the amount of the credit due us.  It is likely that the amount would become public if it is presented in the California proceeding.

Please give us your thoughts as to the use of the CTC receivable to offset potential refunds in the California proceeding.

It looks like a proposed decision on the negative CTC issue will be deferre=

 it owes us before the PUC returns to the issue and once again contemplates=
 making a ruling that could jeopardize our negative CTC claim.  Mike Day, L=

esale, PGE, and EES to form a "working group" to put together and to implem=
ent an SCE collection strategy.  This would involve claims of Portland Gene=
ral and EWS as well as the negative CTC claim.  The leverage we have now th=

(2) the threat that we will put them into bankruptcy.  We may not be able t=
o get an agreement to a cash payment, but perhaps we could get acquiescence=
 in netting 100% of the negative CTC against customers' bills, dismissal of=
 the counterclaim, and other noncash value.  We are concerned that if we do=
 nothing the CPUC will eventually strip us of our right to collect this mon=

Please find attached a model showing the balances for other charges and CTC charges for QF's.  The QF numbers are from a report by MRW from last fall.  That those numbers should be reconsidered given the large changes in the QF contracts and in the change in market prices.

Please find attached the spreadsheet showing the values "TJOHNSONHISTORY" and the MRW report called "Final Report".  Please call me on my cell phone if you have any questions; the number is 503 720 0926.

This time, with attachment.

At the request of the TFG Steering Committee, we are circulating the testimony prepared by Richard Tabors that Powerex plans to submit regarding the special features of hydropower systems and their role in the PNW.  This is testimony that the TFG or a number of its members may wish to support or refer to at hearing.  The text is a slightly modified version of what Powerex filed at the July 9 hearing in the settlement conferences before Judge Wagner.

We will be circulating Richard's draft testimony on economic issues later this afternoon for TFG review.

Also, please be advised that the Steering Committee suggests that Ripple Claim testimony that TFG members may file individually contain an aggregate gross refund number, and refer to the number of sellers who would be responsible for the refunds.  To keep peace in the family, the Steering Committee recommends that individual sellers with refund responsibility NOT be named.  Since this testimony will not be admitted into evidence and will not be subject to cross, but will be placed in the record as an offer of proof, the Steering Committee believes that work papers need not be supplied.  So the identities of the first wave Ripple Claim respondents  need not be revealed under this approach.

Please be advised that Powerex intends to submit its Ripple Claim testimony  on the basis recommended by the Steering Committee.

Mike - just a couple thoughts -

slide #1 - could reinforce the near certainty of DA ending July 1
                - regarding the SDGE rate freeze, we should see a proposed order today perhaps increasing the rate freeze from 6.5 cents to something like 9.5 cents, so sales folks will need to know that outcome.

Later in the package, where the product is described - how certain are we that "Enron's commodity price will beat the UDC generation component"?    Do we guarantee this or are we just claiming it will - and if so, based on what?

Subject:	SCE - Call with Tom Walper
Importance:	High


        Tom Walper  just called to acknowledge receipt of our letter.  His tone was  cordial.  He said Ted Craver is out until Monday and asked if we could wait  to talk until then.  I said (cordially) "sure."
        Walper said  that as SCE begins to talk to our group, as it now is, it wants to get off on  the right foot.  He asked why we are interested in a forbearance  agreement - is our concern that SCE wouldn't have enough money to  pay generators if it paid others first?
        I said I  could not speak for the group, and that one point of meeting is  that creditors may have different perspectives that they will want to  express directly.  
        We then  talked "out of school" - each saying we were not speaking even for our clients -  as follows:
        I said that  I don't have enough information to know that SCE will be able to pay the  generators, so would appreciate having SCE address the credit issue Walper  raised.  The second concern I identified was that SCE would make its peace  with everyone else then declare WW3 on generators.  Thus, as we said in the  letter, I indicated that we would be interested in a commitment to make peace  with us before paying everyone else.
        Walper said  - your claims aren't liquidated; it wouldn't be fair to ask us to hold up  everyone else until your claims are fixed.  I suggested that agreeing to  some process for liquidating them (like the current FERC proceeding) other  than through endless litigation would alleviate some of my concern about  WW3.
        We left it  at that.  I expect to hear from Walper again on Monday.
 
PS to Ted Collins -  please let me have the email address for your in-house contact to I can add him  to the group list; your secreatry gave only his physical address.

The wierdness continues.....

In the Senate:
After Burton's "proclamation" yesterday afternoon that Senate bill 78XX was "all Edison was getting, period," the bill was voted down in committee and never made it to the full Senate for a vote.
The bill will be "reconsidered" (i.e., voted on again) today in the same committee.  

In the Assembly:
Hertzberg's bill (82XX) got voted down initially, until Rod Wright switched his vote and let it get out.
82 XX then went to the appropriations committee, where it was voted out, and now it's scheduled for a floor vote this morning.
83XX, the bipartisan bill led by Wright (D) and Richman (R), was also voted out of committee and will go to appropriations today.

Will report back later this AM with any additional information.

Best,
Jeff

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Very quick and dirty--not even fully proofed.   But wanted to get something out for folks to shoot at.  Let me know your thoughts. Sure I've missed about a million things and mucked up about the same amount.  Happy Thanksgiving.

Best,
Jeff

>     
> CARE contends that ample evidence of DWR's acting as the California IOU's

> Public Utilities Commission ("PUC") for a Revised Revenue Requirement and 
> Power Purchase Costs Pursuant to Water Code Section 80110 and Public 
> Utilities Code Section 451 , which is further illustrated by the PUC's

> 01-10-044, and 01-01-0045 to the PUC , which states:

> over the remaining 5 quarters of the revenue requirement period set forth

> 
> Clearly it is the intent of the DWR to act as the IOU's "designated

Subject: Two Rulings Re: SDG&E's Motion For Implementation of MOU and Prop
osed Settlement of Pending Writ of Review



Attached are two rulings pertaining to recent filings made by SDG&E in
(A.00-11-038, A.00-11-056 and A.00-10-028) and in (A.00-10-045 and
A.01-01-044).

SDG&E filed a motion on July 13, 2001 in A.00-10-045 and A.01-01-044 for
implementation of the memorandum of understanding (MOU) that was signed by
the California Dept. of Water Resources and by SDG&E/Sempra Energy.  SDG&E's
motion set forth a proposed roadmap for the implementation of the MOU.  The
attached Chief ALJ ruling shortens the time for interested parties to
respond to SDG&E's July 13, 2001 motion, and requests responding parties to
comment on certain MOU issues.  Interested parties may file a response to
this motion on or before July 27, 2001.

In A.00-11-038 et. al, SDG&E has proposed to settle all issues related to
SDG&E's pending petition for writ of review of Decision (D.) 01-01-061 and
D.01-05-035.  On July 2, 2001, Commissioner Lynch issued an ACR inviting
parties to file comments on this proposed settlement agreement.  In a letter
from the CPUC's General Counsel dated July 13, 2001 to Sempra Energy, the
letter stated that another ACR would issue setting a comment period on the
proposed settlement of the pending petition once the materials about the MOU
were filed with the Commission.  The attached ruling of Commissioner Lynch
provides that interested parties may file additional comments on the
proposed settlement of the pending writ of review in light of the MOU.
These comments are to be filed on or before July 27, 2001.

JEFF:


Here are the components of extended CTC which may be recovered beyond the
statutory deadline of March 31, 2002:

PU code Section 367(a)(1)

Employee-related transition costs as defined in PU Code Section 375(b) which
include severance costs, retraining, early retirement, outplacement and
related expenses for utility employees (mainly in the generation
departments) who are no longer employed as a result of restructuring.
These costs can continue only until December 31, 2006.  As the two year
period for contract retention of generation employees has lapsed, most of
these expenses should be declining.  However, we do not have accurate
numbers for current levels of expense at this time.

367(a)(2)

Power purchase obligations which generate CTC can continue to be collected
through the duration of the contract or the duration of any agreement for
the renegotiation, buyout or buydown of a power purchase agreement so long
as it does not extend the power purchase contract.  Some of these contracts
have 15-20+ years remaining.

367(a)(4)

Nuclear incremental cost incentive payments for SCE and SDG&E's San Onofre
plant may be recovered up to but not after December 31, 2003. 

367(a)(5)

The costs of CTC exemptions granted in Section 374 (Irrigation districts,
federal power districts and UC Davis) may be recovered through the original
deadline of March 31, 2002 and up to $50 million of any cost unrecovered at
that time may be collected after that deadline.

367(a)(6)

The fixed transition amounts related to the Rate Reduction Bonds authorized
in P U Code Section 840 may be recovered from those customers for whom the
FTA charges are allocated by Section 841 until all the Rate Reduction Bonds
are repaid.

That is the complete list of "tail end" CTC.  


NOTE these related provisions of AB 1890:

367(a)(3)

BRPU settlement agreement costs can only be recovered until March 31, 2002.
Most of the BRPU cancellation claims have been settled, but some may remain.
Payments are almost certainly still being made under a variety of
settlements.  We do not have accurate information on the number of
settlements or payments.

379

Nuclear decommissioning costs are excluded from transition costs and may be
recovered as a non-bypassable charge until fully recovered, and may be
accelerated.   The statute does not describe the process for acceleration.
Presumably the normal CPUC orders on decommissioning ratemaking will
continue to apply.



Please let me know if you need more information in this regard.

Subject:	$.01 surcharge as "tax"

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Gordon:

Thank you for your message.   To respond to your voice mail - we left space for these costs from your model to be added to Sheet 2- Assumptions/Data (under "Other Costs").  A "Regulatory Costs" column can then be added to Sheets 6 and 7, to the right of "Above Market Costs", and the weighted average total can then be recalculated.  

Please let us know if you would like to set up a time to discuss any questions about our assumptions, probabilities, etc.  If you need further assistance with additional numbers, please contact Jim Steffes.

I am reattaching our model as I found a small mistake in the one I sent earlier today. 

Thanks, 

Jennifer

I am resending the same file as before (although to a larger group) and  need to make a correction regarding one assumption.  I am told the analysis does not yet include the gas indexed contracts.  We're working on getting them  included and when they are, the overmarket value will likely increase.

Subject:	DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative "mark-to-market" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

PLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.

As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.
In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.
The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).
When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).
In effect, "core" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  
The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.
The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).
Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.
The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.
Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address "the DWR contract problem" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any "out clauses" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that "outs" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)
In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.
All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.

We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.

Thanks,
Jeff

Thanks.  One other question, which seems like a legal question.  Assume that Enron openly advocates for the PUC to apply the charges to all customers, including ours, understanding that our customers neither benefited from or caused the charges.  If the PUC does it, and we go back to our customers and claim that an indirect tax has been applied, are we in any kind of bind for having pushed for it?  I'm hoping that the answer is no.  Thanks for the info.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	$.01 surcharge as "tax"

A typical clause reads as follows:

" 'Taxes' means any and all new or existing governmental or quasi-governmental taxes, assessments, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings of any kind or nature whatsoever and howsoever described, including gross receipts, franchise, sales, use , property, excise, capital, stamp, transfer, employment, occupation, generatiion, privilege, Utility Taxes [separately defined to include "any and all franchise, utility, regulatory, BTU or energy, gross receipts, administrative services, municipality, and utility user taxes and similar taxes and energy resource and municipal land use surcharges and other similar surcharges"], regulatory, BTU, energy, consumption, lease, transaction, license, filing, recording, and activity taxes, levies, duties, fees, charges and withholdings, together with any and all penalties, fines, interest, and additions thereto, but excluding any taxes on the net income of EESI or any affilitates."

Under the contracts the Buyer is usually responsible for taxes "applicable to Power at or after the Delivery Point" (the meter); the Seller is usually responsible for taxes "applicable prior to the Delivery Point."  The surcharge would seem to be applicable "at the Delivery Point."

Support for the argument that the surcharge is not a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  The CPUC refers to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It was not imposed by a governmental body (such as a state, county, or municipality)

     3.  When first implemented, all proceeds went to the utilities

     4.  It appears that a portion of the proceeds may continue to go to the utilities

Support for the argument that the surcharge is a "tax" under the contracts:

     1.  Since the "frozen tariff" remains in place it is disingenuous to refer to it as a "rate increase"

     2.  It now appears that the proceeds will go to a governmental entity, the DWR

     3.  The definition of "taxes" under the contract is broad and includes surcharges of all types

     4.  To the extent the $.01 surcharge is to pay for generation for bundled customers, those on direct access receive, if anything, only an indirect benefit, which is similar in effect to a tax and not to a rate increase

Bob, how should we handle this?  Should Sue Mara, Jeane or I contact SCE concerning the late fees?

Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing
the amount we have disputed so far, the charges could be substantial.

I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?

Here's my take.  Slash away at will.  Sue, saw your notes, but didn't try to incorporate.  You should add anything I've missed, got wrong, etc.  Pulled it together quickly.  Hope there aren't too many errors.  And hope it helps.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Regulatory Affairs Committee
       Power Marketers Working Group

FROM: Jim Steffes, Regulatory Affairs Committee Chair
            Bob Reilley, Power Marketers Working Group Chair
            Julie Simon, Vice President of Policy

DATE: August 14, 2001

RE: EPSA Draft Petition for Rehearing of FERC's July 25th
      California Refund Order

Attached is a draft Petition for Rehearing of the Commission's July 25th Order on refunds for the California and WSCC wholesale markets.  The Petition is largely procedural, focusing on the lack of any finding of abuse of market power or an adequate factual record to order refunds.  We also oppose the Pacific Northwest refund process and argue that marketers should have an opportunity to show their actual costs in any refund proceeding.
Petitions for rehearing are due at FERC on Friday, August 24th.  We will discuss this draft on the weekly conference call this Friday, August 17th.  In addition, please forward any comments or proposed changes to the draft to Julie Simon at jsimon@epsa.org no later than noon on Wednesday, August 22nd so that we can make this filing is a timely manner.  If you have any questions or concerns, please contact Julie at 202-628-8200.

Every day at Enron I learn to be a little less modest.  I am not there yet, but I keep on trying.

In terms of $s, we can add $30 million to our receivables.  I will try to get the backup from Chris Stokley.

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

In a nutshell:

The governor and assembly leadership (without Rod Wright) have reached
agreement and believe they have the 41 votes to support the below:
o There will be a $2.9 Billion bailout that can be used to pay the QF's and
the banks, but not the generators-either directly or indirectly-and will be
recovered through a Dedicated Rate Component charged to consumers 20 kwh and
above.

o Business and consumer interests are being briefed at the moment by the
staff of Davis and Angelides on the proposal.

o The easement language is consistent with the language proposed in 78xx

o The renewable portfolio standard language is primarily consistent with
82xx however discussions on final language are continuing now.

o Regarding the transmission lines and direct access, language has not been
written and discussions are also continuing.  In fact much of the bill is
being drafted now and is said to circulate tomorrow among members.  Davis
has indicated that he wants a vote as soon as Thursday

o The Senate has not agreed, but there are staff meetings going on now.

o The CPUC has not involved in the discussions, but the administration
continues to assure that no CPUC action will be taken in contrary to the
language of the bill.

Please feel free to call with questions and as always we will keep you
posted.

Privileged and Confidential Attorney-Client Communication

This is to recap our discussion today about two billing issues--recoupment =
of the PX Credit and the $10 surcharge.  I would appreciate it if those of =
you with more first-hand information, particularly Wanda and Diann, correct=
 or clarify anything I've misstated.  Also, please forward this to anyone e=
lse with an interest in this matter.

A.  Recoupment of the PX Credit (also known as the "Negative CTC")

     1.  Background:  The issue here relates to the fact that PG&E and SCE =
are no longer reflecting credit balances on the bills for our customers.  P=
rior to our returning the customers to bundled service in March, the bills =
would reflect the PX Credit as an offset to T&D charges.  SCE and PG&E have=
 now removed the PX Credit from the bill and are attempting to charge us fo=
r T&D, despite the fact that they owe us hundreds of millions of dollars in=
 PX Credits.  This is potentially harmful particularly in view of the opini=
on of perhaps three of the Commissioners that the PX Credit can only be col=
lected as a bill credit, and not in cash.  Mike Day, our regulatory lawyer,=
 expressed his strong opinion that removing the Credit from the bills was i=
mproper, and that we should challenge the action by making a filing with th=
e CPUC.  Note:  the PX Credit to which I am referring here is that which ac=
crued to prior to December 31, 2000; the utilities do not dispute that a PX=
 Credit accrued during that time frame, and there is no dispute as to the p=
roper methodology for computing the PX Credit for that time frame.  Further=
more, PG&E and SCE are in virtual agreement with us as to the amount of the=
 Credit that had accrued as of December 31, 2000.

    2.   Action Items/Issues:  (a)  With respect to SCE, Legal is evaluatin=
g filing a suit in federal court versus filing at the CPUC.  The CPUC has a=
 process whereby we could prevent the utilities from disconnecting our cust=
omers while the issue is being determined (by depositing the payments in an=
 interest-bearing account controlled by the CPUC); while there is no equiva=
lent procedure in federal court, one can request that the court enter an in=
junction against the utilities disconnecting customers.   While the analysi=
s is worth doing, I suspect that we will conclude that we have to go to the=
 CPUC for relief.  (b)  With respect to PG&E, the banruptcy team is evaluat=
ing whether to file at the CPUC or in bankruptcy court.

    3.  Timing:  Late fees will begin accruing August 20.  The first discon=
nect notices would not be received until September 19.

    4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Pursuing action at the CPUC or in cour=
t to force the utilities to restore the PX Credit to our bills has no effec=
t on the issues of how the CTC should be calculated post-January 17, and pr=
ospectively.

B.  $10 Surcharge

     1.  Backgound:  Although when provisionally imposed in January the $10=
 surcharge went to the utilities to keep them financially solvent,  when ma=
de permanent in March it became dedicated to defray the DWR's purchases of =
power on behalf of the utilities.  This evolution gives rise to two bases f=
or EES to argue that it should not bear the financial burden of the $10 sur=
charge.  First, since the $10 surcharge is now dedicated to purchasing gene=
ration for bundled customers only, and not direct access customers, direct =
access should not have to pay it.  This is the same logic that caused the C=
PUC to exempt direct access customers from the $30 surcharge.
Secondly, if legitimately applied to direct access, because it is of no dir=
ect benefit to direct access customers it (arguably) can only be viewed as =
a tax.  Under EES's contracts with its customers, taxes assessed at the del=
ivery point are borne by the customer.  Note:  SCE, unlike PG&E, may not im=
pose the $10 surcharge on direct access customers, according to a filing ma=
de at the staff level at the CPUC, so this action may relate to PG&E only.

     2.  Action Items/Issues:  (a)  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) has the lead i=
n advising us about a challenge to the application of the $10 surcharge to =
direct access customers at the CPUC.  It may be advisable for an industry g=
roup rather than Enron to make the filing.  (b)  I would expect that we wou=
ld follow the same procedure outlined above--depositing the payment with th=
e CPUC--to prevent any customer from being disconnected.  In the interim we=
 would likely bill the customer for the surcharge and promise a credit if o=
ur challenge to the application of the surcharge to DA customers is success=
ful. (c) A decision will need to be made on how far we go back--to July 1 w=
hen the customers became DA again or to January 4 when the surcharge was fi=
rst imposed.

     3.  Timing.  Same timeframe as with the Recoupment issue since we will=
 need to have CPUC challenge on file to prevent late fees and disconnect no=
tices.

     4.  Effect on other CTC issues:  Regulatory (Jim Steffes) will analyze=
 with the appropriate people the effect, if any, of taking this position on=
 other CTC issues (principally how CTC should be calculated post-January 17=
, and prospectively).=20

End.    =20

On August 10th, SCE filed a motion in Docket 98-07-006, et al (same docket
which they filed their petition to suspend payment of the PX credit) in
which they request resolution of direct access issues.  Specifically, SCE is
seeking resolution of the following issues:

(1) How should SCE calculate the direct access credit from January 19, 2001
forward?

(2) If schedule PE is adopted on an interim basis, what should replace the
PE credit on a going forward basis?

(3) Should direct access customers receive a credit for the one cent
surcharge?

(4) Should customers who switched or will switch from bundled service to DA
after DWR began procuring energy for bundled service customers be charged
for DWR costs?

(5) How would the transition costs, if any, that are the responsibility of
DA customers be determined in the absence of a transparent energy price?

SCE is asking that the commission expeditiously resolve these issues as part
of this proceeding.

We may want to chime in an support SCE on this.  Answers to the motion are
due on August 27th.

I do not have an e-mail version of the motion, but will fax it to anyone who
wants a copy.

This is the negative CTC claim.  Transmission and other charges we owe have been set off; ie this is a net amount and the gross CTC is much larger- on the order of $900MM.  Decision to use or not is not final in Enron; keep confidential.  The potential witness would be Wanda Curry.  Thanks,  Ray

Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzberg's chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly.  He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento.  See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill:

A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today.
With respect to DA, the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill.
Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard, explaining that, since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through "exit fees," there is no reason to suspend DA. 
The Governor is resisting hard, stating that "he wants time for the market to stabilize."
So it looks like the Governor's plan is to 1) have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of 1.1.03 and 2) have the PUC "temporarily suspend" DA from September 1 to 1.1.03.
We're continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate, or significantly shorten, the suspension.
The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August 23, 2001 (yesterday) will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts.  The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs' behalf between Jan 17 and the date of the switch.
The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept 1 be responsible for DWR going forward contracts (though details of how that would work were not clear).
The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August 23rd date is to prevent a "rush" to Direct Access between now and Sept 1.
There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept 1.
Finally, the bill apparently will also give self-generation priority over Direct Access in each "open season." The bill would set aside 250 MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen.  If the self gen is not subscribed, the MWs would go to DA.
The bill, including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues, is supposed to be released today.
The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon.
We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions.
It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly.  
The politicians are very reluctant to pass any "Edison bail out bill" and the political pressure not to vote on any "bailout" is significant and growing.  But the Governor is working the bill very hard.
Mirant is actively working against the bill.  
Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a "bailout" could lose re-election.  Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes.
The bill also has to make it through the Senate.  Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President, John Burton, who said flatly that "he's not doing anything."  But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session, and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is 50-50.
With respect to the bill's provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the "dedicated rate component" included,  Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers.  Edison also said that, under the Assembly version of the bill, Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds.

More info to follow as it becomes available.  If anyone has any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.

Best,
Jeff

Subject:	Latest Legislative Version of Direct Access --08.22.01

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly. 

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

This is the last version of 27 that was floated around.  AT the time -- a couple of months ago -- Aaron had been the point person to "keep talking" to Bowen and had discussed these changes with her office.  At this point, Norm Plotkin will be point for ARM and will coordinate all the members and their lobbyists.

The following are some of the proposed amendments to SBX2 78, in concept.
The amendments were developed by the Administration and Assembly Democratic
leadership and have not been finalized, nor have they been run past the
Senate in full detail.  It is unlikely that the Assembly will take the bill
up this week.

Direct Access: SBX2 78 will contain the final DA provisions from ABX2 82
which are located in Water Code Section 80110.  The amendments, in short,
provide that customers may switch during open enrollment periods provided
that there is enough head room and in proportion to the customer class.  The
Assembly has apparently convinced the Treasurer that DA can exist provided
there are non-bypassable charges and specified exit fees.

Threshold: The payment threshold will be lowered to 20 kw for 100% of the
undercollection despite the Senate's objections.  Lowering the threshold to
20 kw will probably force some of the liberal Democrats off the bill but
will bring even more of the moderate Democrats on to the bill.

Tax Refund: SCE will keep the $400 million projected tax refund and not have
that amount applied towards the bonding amount.

Easements: The easements are currently in the bill, however, they may need
to come out in order to secure moderate Democratic votes.

Renewable Portfolio Standard:  The RPS from ABX2 82 will be included in SBX2
78.

FYI-

The attached ruling denies PG&E's motion to combine the issues surrounding
the DWR revenue requirement and revenue allocation with the utility retained
generation proceeding.  The ruling, however, sets an alternative schedule
for separate consideration of the DWR revenue requirement and allocation
issues as they relate to PG&E and SCE (not SDG&E).  The commission has
requested more information from DWR on the revenue requirement it submitted
on May 2nd and upon receipt of that information will give parties the
opportunity to review it and file comments.

The Senate, the Assembly and the Governor are either poised to engage in very difficult negotiations, or the three are about to crash and burn and Edison's going to be left dangling.

In the Senate:
The Senate bill 78XX is with about 90% likelihood going to be voted out of the Senate tonight---without a vote having taking place in any committee.
Burton announced during one of the two "informational" hearings that "this is it," despite the view of just about everyone who appeared before the committees the bill likely won't prevent Edison from going bankrupt.
The key features of the bill are:
Banks and QFs get paid in full.
Edison shareholders would be responsible for debts owed to suppliers
No direct access.
There are conflicting reports about whether the Senate will take up the bill tomorrow de-linking the bonds from the DWR contracts and whether the Republicans will go along with it.

In the Assembly:
The Committee is hearing the Wright and Hertzberg bills as we speak, with Hertzberg's the likely winner.
That bill now provides for Direct Access under certain conditions (the amendments describing the conditions were faxed today).
We're attempting to get the "July 12" date changed to "the effective date of the bill" or later.
The Assembly likely won't vote the Hertzberg bill out until tomorrow at the earliest.

The Problem:
The Assembly and Senate bills are diametrically opposed in the way each approaches the problem---in short, the bills are two ships passing in the night.
The Democratic leaders (Governor, Hertzberg, Burton) aren't talking, and Burton hasn't expressed any interest in talking---to anybody.

The likely outcome given the circumstances:  
Burton says he's done what he needs to do (i.e., passed out a "fair" bill); the Assembly and Senate can't agree; they finish the budget; time runs out; they leave Friday; and Edison's left twisting.

That said, there's still a chance that the Governor could call Burton and sit down with Burton and Hertzberg and work something out by Friday, or begin talking and postpone the recess until they get it worked out.  But given Burton, the chance of that happening seems very slim.

In short, little has changed since yesterday.

Best,
Jeff

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets." 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

Attached for your information is a copy of the Petition for Modification of=
  D.01-05-064 which ABAG POWER filed on July 13.  On behalf of ABAG, I woul=
d  like to solicit your support of this petition.  The decision in question=
 is  the Commission's May 15 decision where it approved the rate design for=
 the  three-cent rate increase. =20
=20
You may recall that the decision approved a 12-month surcharge for all  bun=
dled service customers to make up for the revenue which PG&E and SCE did  n=
ot recover during the interim period between the March 27 issuance of  D.01=
-03-082 and the subsequent issuance of the May 15 decision.  You also  know=
 that the May decision provided specifically that DA customers were NOT to =
 be subject to the rate increase.=20
=20
The ABAG petition for modification seeks to have the Commission clarify  th=
at DA customers who received DA service during the interim period between t=
he  two decisions should not be subject to the one-year sucharge, even if t=
hey were  subsequently returned to bundled service.  The arguments supporti=
ng this  position are as follows:

Direct  access customers were specifically exempted from the procurement-re=
lated rate  increase because they do not receive procurement service.  They=
 should therefore be similarly  exempted from the12-month procurement surch=
arge, even if they subsequently  returned to bundled service.  =20
The inability of PG&E to pay all amounts  due and owing under the PX credit=
 have caused the budgets of ABAG POWER  Members to be placed under signific=
ant financial stress.  The Member public agencies have  suffered extreme fi=
nancial hardship.   The application of the 12-month procurement surcharge h=
as added to that  burden unnecessarily.
In a separate  proceeding (draft Resolution E-3726),  the Commission has ex=
pressed  its intent to "guard against inequities" for direct access custome=
rs of  SDG&E.  ABAG POWER asks simply  that the Commission afford similar p=
rotection to the direct access customers  of PG&E who did not receive bundl=
ed procurement service during the  interval between the March and May Decis=
ions. =20
Moreover, in addition  to being inequitable, the application of the procure=
ment surcharge to  non-procurement direct access customers would be discrim=
inatory and would  cause the utilities to violate the anti-discrimination p=
rovisions of the  Public Utilities Code, Sections 453(a) and 453(c).

ABAG POWER  would very much appreciate the support of ESPs and other market=
 participants at  the Commission.  Under Rule 47(f) of the Commission's Rul=
es of Practice and  Procedure, "Responses to petitions for modification mus=
t be filed and served  within 30 days of the date that the petition was ser=
ved, unless the  administrative law judge sets a different date. Responses =

the petition and must  comply with the requirements of Rules 2, 2.1, 2.2, 2=
.3, and 2.5."  Filings  sooner than that would be appreciated.  Please give=

Here is the PG&E 10-K disclosure, which does not help much.


Under AB 1890, when the Utility has recovered its eligible transition 
costs, the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the 
transition period will have been satisfied. At August 31, 2000, consistent 
with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC, the Utility 
credited its TCBA by $2.1 billion, the amount by which a negotiated $2.8 
billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book 
value of such assets. Based on this credit, the Utility believes it recovered 
its eligible transition costs during August 2000. At August 31, 2000, there 
was a balance of approximately $2.2 billion of undercollected wholesale power 
costs recorded in the TRA. If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets 
is greater than $2.8 billion, as the Utility expects, the Utility believes it 
will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May 2000. The 
undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition 
period will be less than the $2.2 billion August 31, 2000 balance and could be 
zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when 
the transition period actually ends. Under current CPUC decisions and AB 1890, 
the Utility's customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs 
after the Utility has recovered its transition costs. 
  
   In one of its March 27, 2001 decisions, the CPUC adopted TURN's proposal to 
transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utility's TRA to the utility's 
TCBA. The accounting changes are retroactive to January 1, 1998. The Utility 
believes the CPUC is retroactively transforming the undercollected power 
purchase costs in the TRA into transition costs in the TCBA. However, the CPUC 
characterized the accounting changes as merely reducing the prior revenues 
recorded in the TCBA, thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost 
recovery achieved to date. The CPUC also ordered that the utilities restate 
and record their generation memorandum accounts balances to the TRA on a 
monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA. The CPUC 
found that based on the accounting changes, the conditions for meeting the end 
of the rate freeze have not been met. 
  
   The Utility believes the adoption of TURN's proposed accounting changes 
results in illegal retroactive ratemaking and constitutes an unconstitutional

All:

I changed the following:

1. Reduced total load from 185,000 GWh to 178,000 GWh.
2. Allocated the "costs" by utility based on total demand
3. Changed the DWR negative MTM on contracts from $7.5B to $9.55B
4. Added an undercollection of $.932 Billion for SDG&E (more below)

I did not:

1. Add the Nuclear decommissioning as it is funded on balance sheet.


I added the following:

1. Allocated the Bonds and Contracts on DWR share of Revenue Requirement %.
2. The CTC is the softest assumption.   The utilities wrote off considerable Transition Revenue Account (undercollection) and Transition Cost Balancing Account Balance (primarily stranded cost) at year end.  The Regulatory Asset for PG&E and Edison is assumed to be primarily TCBA at 6-30-01, but there is no footnote to absolutely corroborate this.   The Undercollection for SDG&E is assumed at the Regulatory Asset balance at 6-30-01.   This is due to the rate freeze having ended for SDG&E and therefore their TCBA should be recovered (reduced to zero). 

Results:

One of the key driver to the utility-by-utility allocation is the difference between total volume and share of DWR costs.   DWR allocated costs to have a uniform "rate" across the net short by utility.   Thus those with a larger portion of their total demand (SDG&E and to a lesser extent PG&E) which is covered by DWR, have a higher unit cost across all rates for the Bonds and Contracts.  Edison has the converse.

Any changes in assumptions are welcomed.



Regards,



Michael

Michael,

Jim has asked Jennifer and me to estimate the potential exposure (worst case) to the Company's book position for DA customers in California.  Starting from the  model you and Jeff developed we have added other possible categories of charges allowed by existing regulations.

We would appreciate if you could please review the attached and provide us with any feedback.  If available we would like to call you Wednesday morning to discuss.

Calvin,  per our discussion,  at the time we returned our commercial customers to utility service earlier this year,  all accounts had accrued credit balances.  PG&E transferred these credits off each account as they were setting them up for utility billing.

These same accounts are now being returned to direct access.  We began receiving the first DA bills from PG&E earlier this month, all with zero beginning balances.  Enron expects that all credit balances will be reinstated on the respective accounts before the next billing cycle.

Wes,
 
FYI.  

Jeff Dasovich met with SCE to discuss settlement of  Enron's PX claims.  Nothing was agreed to, but I wanted to make certain you were aware of this meeting.  It is interesting that all of SCE's comments dealt with their under collection and the DWR costs.  I have not continued to monitor current tariff assumptions.  However, I do not believe estimates for the resolution of these issues are currently included.   As I understand things, it remains anybody's guess as to what will be required of direct access customers, much less how much of the under collection SCE will be allowed to recover.  Regulatory Affairs is working closely with the desk to completely understand the impact of future regulatory decisions and work to obtain the best result for Enron.  

I will make sure you and Mary Lynne stay informed re these discussions.   If you would like to discuss, just call. 


Wanda

Subject:	Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.

Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.

Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.

We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.

Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.

Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

Best,
Jeff

Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.

Subject: RE: Pending DASR's for Existing Enron Customers
Importance: High


Matt,

I thought I'd respond for Diann.  The decision is pretty clear on this.  As you recall, the issue was raised by UC/CSU who specifically mentioned that the utilities were unilaterally setting deadlines for submission of customer names and DASRs. Let me quote:

Section F, p. 19:

"In its rehearing application, UC/CSU seek clarification on whether D.01-09-060's prohibition of any new contracts for direct access services after September 20, 2001, allows or requires utilities to refuse to process DASRs for an account under a pre-September 20 contract."

p.20:

"We reaffirm that for the time being, and unless the Commission states otherwise in a subsequent decision, utilities are required to process DASRs relating to contracts or agreements that were executed on or before September 20, 2001, including DASRs for service to new facilities or accounts if the underlying contract pursuant to which those DASRs are submitted allowed for the provision of that additional service."

p.21

"For purpose of utility compliance with D.01-09-060, we want to make it clear that, unless otherwise directed or allowed to in a subsequent Commission decision, utilities cannot set a deadline after which they could refuse to process DASRs relating to contracts excuted on or before September 20, 2001."

Matt, these are just the highlights.  The Decision has more language providing additional clarity.  By the way, this decision was mailed on October 12 -- after your October 5 deadline. I think the Decision is crystal clear.  You must accept all DASRs for contracts signed on or before September 20 and you cannot set artificial deadlines after which you will not accept those DASRs.

So, given the above.  Can you please explain your position?

Regarding the Novemver 1 date -- you may remember the Rule 22 meeting held by the utilities, ESPs and customers in eaarly October.  The ESPs agreed to make a good faith effort to provide a complete customer list by November 1, with the understanding that additional names and facilities could be added later with some verification process to ensure the DA contract was signed on or before September 20.  We agreed to do this to help the utilities meet their obligations under D. 01-09-060.  Enron has met that commitment.

Hi Diann,

It seems there is a bit of confusion.  I agree with you that there is no
longer a DASR submittal deadline in accordance with decision D 01-10-036.
However, SCE will only accept DASRs for those customers on the certified
list Enron provided by the 10/5/2001 deadline (see previous emails supplied
below).  I'm not sure, but perhaps the 11/1 date you are referencing is in
the Advice Letter filed jointly by PG&E and SDG&E?

Matt, neither Enron nor the Commission agreed with SCE's arbitrary date.
Further, SCE's approach is in violation of the CPUC's decision on rehearing
(D 01-10-036), which requires SCE to continue to accept DASRs as long as
the respective contract is signed on or before 9-20-01.

Therefore, Enron reserves the right to continue DASRing accounts for
eligible contracts until the CPUC directs otherwise.

Thanks.

Original SCE Communication Sent on September 21, 2001

Pursuant to the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) decision
issued yesterday, the right of end-use customers to acquire direct access
service is suspended as September 20, 2001.  Specifically, the CPUC order
states:

     "The execution of any new contracts, or entering into, or verification
of any new arrangements for direct access
             service pursuant to Public Utilities Code Sections 366 or

Subject:	California Contract Language 

Some thoughts --

1.	Why use the "Special" term?  Just call it DA Charges.  What makes these charges special.  Parallels the def we use of "Special Utility Charges."  Also connotes that these are often imposed outside the normal course of business.
2.	Why limit to "energy procurement" or "public purpose"?  For instance, if the Utilities were to implement a line item charge for past Negative CTC payments, I don't think your language would cover this. Isn't that "future payback of past under collections"?  Seems to me to relate to energy procurement--ie their avoided cost of energy procurement
3.	Does this include the potential for "positive CTC"?  We don't want to miss this cost.  Customer pays CTC as part of "T&D Charges."  CTC is expressly included in the definition of those charges.
4.	What do we do with post March 31, 2002 rate periods?  While the AB1890 rate freeze is premised to continue until March 31, 2002 or when generation-related stranded costs are recovered, we don't know what will be happening after then.  Want to make sure that any non-bypassable charge is paid by customers, including T&D, along with our generation rates.  All T&D is passed through to customer, regardless of when.  We have only priced "retail" generation on these deals.  
5.	How does the concept of re-billing versus prospective rate adjustments get incorporated?  Maybe it gets built into the calculation of CTC, but want to make sure that the right value goes to the right party.  I think the rebilling as opposed to prospective will follow the allocation of charges in the contract.  We talk about things like "however styled or payable" to pick up things like that.

Jim--here is the relevant language.  Customer pays all "Special DA Charges."


"Special DA Charges" means any charges, fees, assessments, adders or surcharges imposed or authorized by any Governmental Authority on "direct access" customers (regardless of whether any such charge is also imposed on other classes or types of customers), however styled or payable, that are related to (i) a Utility's, ISO's or Governmental Authority's energy procurement, including, without limitation, charges for system reliability, rate recovery, future payback of under-collections, amortization of above market purchases and energy load repurchases; or (ii) public purpose programs, including, without limitation, environmental, social/low income, renewable energy utilization, and demand side management programs.  Such charges will apply regardless of whether the energy requirements of the Accounts are being supplied by us or the applicable Utility.

The call was pretty tough. 
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it. 
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.  
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Best,
Jeff

I have attached a comparison of the revised CDWR Revenue Requirement, along with a comparison with the July 22nd figures.
 
* The total DWR dollars decrease $471.5 million over 2001 and 2002, centered in the periods 3Q 2001 and onward.  The "past problem" actually increases by $1.9 billion (1Q & 2Q 2001).
* PG&E has their share increased $730.1 million over 2002 and 2002, centered in 1Q and 2Q 2001.
* Edison ends up with a significant decrease of $1.199 billion in 2001 and 2002.

Hello all.  I am back from the CPUC and available to participate again.  As
for Sue's concern, I do not believe Edison will say that our payment of PX
credit issue (the subject of the complaints) is directly in the
"free-for-all" case, but they will assert that that case will resolve the
issues related to how to calculate the credit in the post  Jan 17 time frame
and that once that is decided, Edison will have all the information it needs
to pay all the ESPs correctly, as they still intend to pay us on the
original methodology for the pre Jan 17 period.  Therefore, they will say
that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve
all the issues in the complaint.  I should respond to SCE's attorney soon,
so we can contact the judge and ask him to take the matter off calendar.  Is
everyone in accord?  Mike Day

I'm concerned about the 2nd bullet.  We've been taking the position that
we don't want this "payment of PX credit" issue in this proceeding --
the "free-for-all" proceeding. Have we changed our position?  If not, I
am concerned that Edison will either state directly or give the
impression that it's part of the Barnett proceeding.

As part of its Memorandum of Understanding with DWR, SDG&E has filed the
attached advice letter.  If approved, SDG&E would be authorized to transfer
a $104 million overcollection in its TCBA to its Energy Rate Ceiling Revenue
Shortfall Account (the account established to record the revenue shortfall
from the implementation of AB 265).  The $104 million represents the
overcollection in utility retained generation revenues allocated to
customers which did not come under the AB 265 rate ceiling. That group would
include direct access customers.  SDG&E's rationale for the transfer is that
it is the legislature's intent that 100% of SDG&E's retained generation be
used to serve its 100 kW and below customers (i.e., the AB 265 customers).
SDG&E had advanced this theory in its recent rate design case.  It was
opposed by several groups and has not been ruled on by the Commission.

Protests on this advice filing are due August 6th.  Please let me know if
Enron is interested in protesting.

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- An administrative law judge has recommended the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission dismiss a complaint alleging El Paso Corp. (EPG) manipulated the market for natural gas sales into California . 
The ruling in the high-profile, politically charged case was a setback for California , which had sought to hold El Paso financially accountable not only for higher natural gas prices, but also for the resulting higher electricity prices in a state heavily dependent upon gas-fired power plants. 
"While ... El Paso Pipeline and El Paso Merchant had the ability to exercise market power, the record in this case isn't at all clear that they in fact exercised market power," Curtis Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, concluded in an initial decision forwarded to the commission late Tuesday. 
The California Public Utilities Commission, which filed the complaint against El Paso, said later Tuesday that it would appeal Wagner's decision on market manipulation. 
In a small victory for the state, Wagner did find that El Paso officials violated FERC's "standards of conduct" rules barring the sharing of market-sensitive information between pipeline companies and their natural-gas marketing affiliates. 
"El Paso Corp., El Paso Pipeline, and El Paso Merchant are guilty of affiliate abuse," Wagner concluded. 
"There was a dialogue between the pipeline affiliates and the marketing affiliate that gave an unfair advantage to the bidding" by the marketing unit for El Paso pipeline capacity into California , Wagner said. 
FERC had dismissed the issue of affiliate abuse on March 28 without a hearing. At Wagner's request, the commission later agreed to reopen the issue during a hearing into the market-manipulation complaint. 
The proceeding, which began April 4 and concluded August 6, resulted in a hearing record of 32 volumes and totaled 5,573 pages, while 515 exhibits were entered into evidence, Wagner reported. 
"The briefs measured approximately one linear foot," he said. 
 
     Contracting With Affiliates 
   
At issue are contracts worth $38.5 million that El Paso's marketing unit entered into with its pipeline affiliate to secure 1.2 billion cubic feet per day of firm transportation capacity into California from March 2000 through June 2001. 
California argued El Paso had used its control of pipeline space to limit the supply of gas into the state and boost prices. 
The contract period coincided with an unprecedented period of power-market volatility, in which skyrocketing natural gas costs contributed to extreme spikes in electricity prices that ultimately rendered the state's utilities insolvent. 
The judge found that the contracts gave El Paso Merchant more than a 35% market share, the market-power threshold under FERC's merger guidelines, based on his interpretation of the relevant market. El Paso had argued for the higher antitrust-law threshold of 50%, but Wagner ruled that the lower standard should apply. 
But while that market share gave El Paso the "ability to exercise market power," Wagner said, "it is not at all clear from the record in the proceeding that El Paso Merchant and El Paso Pipeline exercised market power." 
The record offers only mixed support for allegations by the CPUC and utilities in the state that El Paso withheld gas supplies to drive up prices, Wagner said. 
>From March through October 2000, El Paso's capacity utilization rate was about half the rate of other shippers, while for the remainder of the contract, the full capacity was used. 
Wagner concluded that El Paso's compliance with FERC rules requiring companies that control pipeline capacity to offer unused capacity to other shippers constituted an effective check against market power. 
 
     Improper Communications Seen 
   
Where the state scored a win was in the second phase of the hearing, where Wagner heard evidence on allegations of affiliate abuse. 
Wagner cited telephone records and correspondence to conclude that El Paso violated FERC rules requiring pipelines and affiliated marketers to operate independently of one another. The rules also restrict communications between pipeline operating personnel and affiliated marketers. 
Transcripts of telephone conversations between pipeline and marketing employees of El Paso "demonstrate blatant collusion ... to keep secret a discount for service" on El Paso's Mojave system until the open season was over in which Merchant was bidding for the pipeline capacity on the sister pipeline, Wagner said, including the transcripts in his opinion. 
Wagner determined that the transcript offered a "prima facie" case of affiliate abuse, and urged El Paso to present witnesses to rebut his finding. But El Paso declined to present the witnesses, the opinion noted. 
Wagner also cited a confidential memorandum to William Wise, El Paso's chief executive, from the head of El Paso Merchant as contributing to his conclusion that El Paso and its pipeline and marketing affiliates "were in clear violation" of FERC's affiliate-abuse rules. 
El Paso replied in a statement that the commission had considered the same evidence and found no abuse in its March 28 ruling. The commission would commit a "legal error" if it adopted the judge's views, the company said. 
The parties have 30 days to file briefs taking exception to the judge's findings. The commission can either accept or reject the judge's findings. 
However the commission ultimately rules in the case, it is expected to end up appealed before a federal appeals court.

Attached is an ACR issued today requesting comment on the Rate Agreement
reached by the CPUC and DWR (which I will send under separate cover).  The
ACR highlights certain aspects of the Agreement and asks for parties to
evaluate the effects of the Agreement and indicate what they believe the
consequences of its adoption would be.  Comments are due by August 1st.

The Agreement itself basically calls for DWR to set its revenue requirement
based on "Bond Related Costs" and "Operating Expenses" and for the
Commission to implement such revenue requirement.  It is up to DWR to
determine whether the revenue requirement is just and reasonable prior to
submitting it to the Commission.

Please let me know if Enron is interested in Commenting on the Agreement.
