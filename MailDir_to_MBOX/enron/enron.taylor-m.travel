I will look for the Johns.  I do not know what to do about Jamie.  He has
been in a funk and it is because of his family thing.  I do not know if we
can commit to a trip - but will work on it. I want to go.  He needs to go.

Thanks for your note back.  Unfortunately I don't get into town until
quite late on Friday evening so Saturday and Sunday are the only days I
can make it.  Do you know yet where you'll be located?

Hey,

B-day = 9/20/73
address = I guess 1801 Calvert Street, NW, Apt 408, Wash DC 20009


Finals suck!  I waited until 3rd year to take all of the crappy
litigation courses that I did not care about and did not want to get
graded on early in my law school career.  I decided to take Evidence
and Crim Pro for bar reasons, but I am really struggling!!!   It does
not help that I will never care about these rules in practice!!!
Yuck!!!  And at the same time it is really sad that it is almost
over.  I am not an academic at heart, but I love Charlottesville and
my laid-back life here.  It will be sad to leave.

I look forward to sailing though and that laid-back life.
Wish me luck.

- Amanda

I sent an e-mail to Amanda to sound out her views.  My guess is that she will 
want to go several times.  Her usual response to a choice is to avoid it.

Since lots of things might work, do you have any preferences/choices.  Are 
you committed to an entire week?  Want to shorten it to a long weekend (or is 
the travel to much of a pain for you).I don't think there is any plan that 
will include Bill in 2000.  If we include Amanda, I think it is either Nov 
3-8 or it is Thanksgiving.  We could do a long weekend on either of those 
dates or if you want to take the whole week off, you and I could go for the 
week and Amanda could join us for part of it.  I don't know how much time you 
want to spend on this venture.  Do you want to wait until 2001?  Give me some 
idea what is your first, second, third choice.  And of course you can choose 
more than one ( I am sure Amanda will).

Wow - too many choices.  Let's see, the day of the week charters start and
end is not fixed - except that the boat has to be available on the days you
want it.  We usually went Sunday to Sunday so we could get 2 weekends in
and use the Saturday as a day to fly down.  It's much harder to get there
from Houston than NYC (fewer flights) so it pretty much takes all day to
get there.  The 3rd - 8th is a Friday through  Wed. - not optimal from the
weekend point of view but doable I suppose  - it just means a 4 day instead
of 7 day charter.  If you want to wait until Thanksgiving we could
certainly manage with the 2 of us - particularly if we got one of the
smaller boats - and it might make sense to go back to the BVI where we know
the sailing won't be all that challenging (I hear the St. Martin area can
get rougher).  Plan B sounds like fun too - and then we could all go
together later (it seems mean to go without Bill) - New Years sounds like a
blast to me!  What would you think about heading down the Friday or
Saturday before (12/29 or 30) and spending the first week of January there?
That assumes Bill can get that week off and Amanda doesn't have to be back
in school til later.  I have a couple of sailing friends here that might
like to go then too if you're interested in a slightly larger  group.
They're a lot of fun, good cooks and reasonable sailors  too!

Amanda has a break from Nov 3-8th  ( and I don't think she has classes on
Friday anyway).  Is that something the three of us can work with?
Alternatively, do you think the two of us could manage over Thanksgiving -
with amanda joining for the long weekend (fly down Thurs eve and back Mon).
I can't remember what day of the week charters begin and end. - is it set
in stone?   Plan B - we could met at the Greenbriar or DC for Thanksgiving.
I understand from Amanda that Bill is not going anywhere until 2001.  Of
course that does make New Year's eve a possibility.  If all else fails, I
did hear from Greg this week and he wants to know if we are still sailing.
And I am still looking for something to do over Christmas.

I sent Amanda & Bill an e-mail a couple of weeks ago and here is Bill's
reply.
I sent him a fairly detailed note on how we usually schedule things and
which
were the best times of year, etc.  I haven't heard anything from Amanda and
was
beginning to assume they were not really interested in a November trip.
Have
you heard anything firm from Virginia?  Bill's next-to-last paragraph tells
me
that he's getting to know Amanda - but I don't think she'll leave him alone
for
the holiday.  The real question is whether her uncanny ability will extend
to
his schedule, too.  If they still want to go we'd better make travel plans
soon
- that Thanksgiving Sunday is notoriously difficult to get seats.  If you'd
rather wait until Jan. or Feb. that's fine with me too.  Just let me know.

Hey Mark, nice to hear from you.  I am glad you enjoyed the wedding.  It
went
by so fast for me but it seems that people had a good time.  Apart from a
few
travel related glitches the honeymoon was also spectacular.  Tahiti is a
true
paradise.

I am committed to the concept of sailing in the Carribean but my problem is
that my honeymoon has put me firmly in "vacation deficit" at the SEC.
Barring any emergency congressional action I will not have enough days
available by Tgiving to truly enjoy sailing in the Carribean.  Amanda has
told me how much fun it is and I want to do it but I may need to find
another
time.  I'll check into it and let you guys know definitively very soon.
How
long to you go for?

Keep in mind though that I do not speak for Amanda.  She has an uncanny
ability to arrange her schedule so that she can participate in virtually
every vacation idea that people bring up.

I'll be in touch,  Bill.

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

Hi group,

 I just wanted to add that Linda has the same flight
plan as Bill and Amanda on the down portion.  She starts at
JFK at 7am, but she meets up with us in San Juan.   Then
she has the same return as ME!

The exam crazed student is off.
Bye Bye

What kind of a fool do you think I am.  No way I am getting in the middle of you and Amanda on vacation plans.  I'll just pack my little bag and wait at the dock until you two show up.  I will however give you both a credit card number - it is 5410 6584 0536 6574  exp 11/01

>>> "Taylor, Mark E (Legal)" <Mark.Taylor@enron.com> 07/20/01 09:48AM >>>
I have tentatively booked us on the QE2 sailing from Southampton at 5pm
on August 29, arriving New York at 7:30am on September 4.  You and
Amanda have a Caronia class cabin at $2045.32 per person, including air
from New York to London (with a business class upgrade on Continental).
I have a single in the same class (so we eat in the same restaurant).
My plan would be to fly over on Sunday evening - the 26th - since I have
to be in Ohio that morning.  With that in mind I have also booked jr.
suites for us at "41" the all-inclusive London hotel near Buckingham
Palace that I've mentioned to you before.  They are at 275 GBP per night
(2 nights).  Of course, if you guys wanted to go earlier to spend more
time in London, I am sure that would be possible.

The difficulty is that Amanda has indicated an interest in staying in
Europe longer - certainly understandable.  Her preference would be to go
over on the boat leaving NY on September 5, arriving in Southampton
Sept. 10 and then stay in Europe for a few weeks.  That doesn't work
quite as well for me because I only have 6 vacation days left and on
that routing I get one less day in London - i.e. we get off the boat on
Monday morning and I have to fly back Tuesday morning.  On the other
hand, we wouldn't be jet lagged on arrival in London!

They will hold the reservation until tomorrow.  What's your preference?

Hello, Mark:



Make any resolutions for the New Year??I've got one for you.?Now repeat after 
me... I will be more spontaneous. I will have more fun. I will indulge my 
whims. my desires. my sense of adventure. I will do it today.Sounds a lot 
better than going to the gym or giving up chocolate, doesn't it? 

So do it this weekend (a three-day weekend for many, I might add!)  and save 
$50.*

No excuses. No regrets. And even more great deals to be had at?Site59.com

I decided to email instead of taking up more room in your
voicemail!   I just wanted to let you know that I found
some cheaper tickets into St Thomas.   I hate St. Thomas
from what I remember, but we would not really be there
long I guess.   Just so you know there are nonstop
flights to St Thomas from BWI for $500.   (The flights
into Tortola are in the $700 range).   I think that Bill
and I are going to use miles unless the prices drop down
below the 500$ range so it does not matter so much for us,
but I just wanted to check that I should only look at
flights into Tortola right?

Also, does it matter which airport on Tortola?  I cannot
remember which is the close one to the Moorings.  Is it
Beef Isl, Tortola code EIS or West end Tortola airport code
TOV?

Finally,  about the return flights.   Mom's only input
(so far) is that she wants to enjoy the million dollar
hotel in VA for the days that she is paying for it.
Meaning she wants to spend some time there on Friday the
18th.     Therefore, the options seem to be:

 (a) to fly into C'ville late on Thursday night.  In
this case you could stay at my house in C'ville.

 (b) To fly into DC on Thursday night then drive
immediately down to C'ville and stay at my house.
(c'ville is about 1.5hrs from Dulles; 2 hrs from National
and 3+ from BWI).

 (b) To fly into DC on Thursday night.  Stay in a
hotel in DC then have a pretty, leisurly drive down to
C'ville on Fri morning.


What do you think?

The slight problem with (a) FOR ME is that if I use the
award promotion on American (the pay some and use some
miles thing) then I need to fly only on American and
American does not fly to C'ville.   This means that I will
need to purchase a separate ticket on Usair or some
other airline.   Also, if I want to fly down with Bill then
my car will be in DC so I will need to pick that up anyway
so I will probably need to do the drive anyway.

I am going to pay for my mom's ticket, so I can have her do
whatever!   Even if I end up in DC for the night the two of
you could continue on to C'ville by plane and stay at my
house.    SOrry, this is confusing, let me know you
thoughts.

Amanda

Bill,

Thanks for the info.

Just so you know, The Moorings provides airport transfers so there will be
somebody with a "Moorings" sign waiting right after you get through customs
who will get you into a van or bus to the base.  It's a little harder to
get to Tortola from Houston so I leave at 6:10 in the morning but don't get
there until a few hours after you guys (on AA5684 which gets there at
5:21).

 It turns out I also need everyone's birthday and address.  Mind sending
yours along?

Mark
