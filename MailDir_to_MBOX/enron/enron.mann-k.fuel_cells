Kay,

 This may not be the most up-to-date version of the Fuel Cell Team Contact 
List, but its a start.  It needs to be updated anyway.  Take care.

I will send you comments via e-mail periodically as I read sections.  Here 
are my comments thru Section 5.

1.  Shouldn't the agreement be in the name of ENA?
2.  Section 2.1--We should have the right to change the persons identified 
listed in Section 2.1 (a) & (b), particularly if we assign.  Do we need a 
procedure?
3.  Section 2.1 (d)--Shouldn't it just say "highway" as opposed to "major 
highway"?
4.  Section 2--Need to add the following concept.  90 days after RTO, 
Purchaser shall identify up to [5] primary or alternative sites for 
installation of the units (identification to include an expected 
configuration).  Upon 10 day notice, Purchaser shall have the right to 
substitute sites or change site configurations.  The project plans shall be 
based on the primary configurations identified by Purchaser.  4 months prior 
to shipment, Purchaser must identify the site where a unit must go.  At this 
point, the site is locked in for that unit.
5.  Section 3.3 (c)--insert "or as reasonably required to implement" after 
"as required by".
6.  Section 3.16--Add in concept of identified sites.  Timing of plans should 
coincide with site identification.
7.  Section 5.1.1--Incorprate concept that shipping per unit is based on the 
lesser of actual costs or $87,000 per unit.  I think that FCE agreed to this 
concept.
8.  Section 5.4--Why is "to be discussed" shown?  I thought that FCE agreed.

1.  Calpine/PG&E--We are definitely going to need your accounting memo by 
tomorrow.  Calpine contacted me yesterday for an update.

2.  Fuel Cells Deal--If ENA executes a purchase order with a fuel cell 
manufacturer and from the purchaser's perspective, that purchase order is 
contingent upon 1) a government agency raising a certain amount of funding 
and 2) a government agency accepting full assignment of the purchase order, 
will signing the purchase order create any balance sheet issues to ENA?

1.  Section 11.1--Do we insert adjustment to purchase price for acceptance 
test here?
2.  Section 11.1--Do we need to make a reference outstanding issue on 
termination and reversion to average pricing?
3.  Section 11.1--Adjustments for Force Majeure continue to make me nervous.  
Where do we narrow the application of this provision?
4.  Section 11.6.2--Can we add FCE's language with a note that we are 
currently reviewing?
5.  Section 14.1.1--Should we say "electric" industry standards?
6.  Section 14.1.1 (a)--Did we agree to give up?
7.  Section14.2--Do we have enough information to write a rough version?
8.  Section 15.1--Is payment withheld while working to improve performance?  
If not, then title transfer seems ok.  Otherwise, I don't know.
9.  Section 17.2--need to incorporate concept that units at site at time of 
termination notice and accepted within 2 months of notice get paid for.  All 
other units are terminated.  We also have the average price issue.
10.  Section 17.4--How do we handle a default by Seller in combination by a 
purchaser delay.  I think that a unit at site which is subject to a Purchaser 
delay should get a day for day relief from the two month acceptance criteria 
and the guaranteed acceptance dates.  Do you agree?

With respect to the laundry list Dave D sent you:

1. Press Releases-the press release has not yet been prepared, but a first 
draft was worked up by FCEL's consel. Cle Dade and I are going to look at it 
with respect to what we think it should say, but have not yet done so.

2.Term Sheet -I will send you a draft of the most recent term sheet I am 
aware of by separate email..I believe they are in discussions with FCEL on 
that draft, but nothing has been signed.

3.Disclosure Discussions-I will also send you under separate email the 
initial draft of the "talking points" for the disclosure discusison. It is 
new and has not been discussed internally yet.

4.Contracts-Initial drafts of the documents for the purchase of the equity 
have been drafted and we await comments from FCEL's counsel.  Kay Mann is 
handling the "State" side of the deal and I request Kay by copy of this memo 
to advise you on what the status of any dealings with the state might be.

5.Regulatory Filings-There will be no filings required with respect to the 
purchase of the equity, unless we have to file a Sched. 13D, which will 
depend upon the timing of the option vesting.  My gut reaction is that we 
will probably need to file the 13D, but it is a routine filing.  I do not 
know what will be required in terms of hearings in the state process and 
again request Kay to please advise us on that.

It seems to me thay we should get a little farther along before we meet with 
the team on this, but I defer to your judgment.  Let me know what you want to 
do.

                                                                Dan

Guys, I have spoken to Cliff and Mark and we are comfortable moving forward 
under the structure we have discussed.

 FCEL: - $5MM in equity and 1.3MM warrants from corporate treasury stock that 
vest based upon 60MW of orders;
  - discussion with FCEL in which we disclose ALL infromation we have about 
the potential Conn. deal - I will require that myself and Mark be on   that 
call;
  - the transaction is fully press released immediately.

 CRRA: - subject to final due diligence on the development risks, we provide 
the management and wrap for CRRA on the potential fuel cell development   
opportunity that consists of between 25 and 50 MW;
  - any appropriation of funds from the government will require DPUC hearing 
at which we will fully disclose in a factual manner our interest in    FCEL.

I will require that Mark Haedicke manage this process and sign off on all 
press releases, term sheets, disclosure discussions, contracts and regulatory 
filings.  I believe that we have this managed appropriately as long as we 
manage the process as per the script and in a factual manner.

Thanks
Delainey

		 Subject: Murtha Cullina Conflict Waiver request

The request that I look at or find the proper person to review a conflicts 
waiver to be executed by Enron Corp. came to me from Daniel Allegretti as I 
am the lawyer working for ENA ( power assets group) in the fuel cell project 
referred to in the attachment. Sheila Tweed advised me you were the proper 
person to be looking at this matter for governmental affairs. I went ahead 
and yesterday did a markup of the requested conflicts waiver from Murtha 
Cullina to keep the ball moving and distributed that markkup internally via 
the attachment, but nothing more has happened since then. The revised waiver 
letter appended to the attachment is marked to show changes to the original 
Murtha request, so I won't forward that document to you unless you want it. 
Please give me a call at your convenience to discuss.

		 Subject: Murtha Cullina Conflict Waiver request

Attached is a suggested markup of the requested conflicts letter. Candidly, I 
don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject 
transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the 
same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of 
impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate 
out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft 
indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions 
until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as 
a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know 
if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual 
representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are 
comfortable on that score.The letter also now  makes clear that Murtha will 
not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation 
involving them. Since the letter requires the signature of Enron Corp., I'm 
trying to find out what clearance is required, as I customarily do not review 
or initial Corp. documents for signature.

Enron regarding our participation on this project:

Nick Politan will be in overall charge of the project, and will be
the principal in charge of outside legal review of development matters,
including the EPC and equipment procurement contracts, assisted by Rick
Filosa.
Both Nick and Rick are located in Bingham's New York office. Bruce Silvers
will

and will be the first lawyer to know when the condition of the orders is 
filled you are probably the right person to blow the whistle for the 13D

These are the latest versions of the EPC LOI and Development Agreement for 
the CRRA Fuel Cell Deal. The Development Agreement has been revised since 
this distribution to add back into the arbitration provision the stipulation 
that the arbitrators selected by the parties need not be neutral. Jeff Ader 
had wanted that stipulation deleted, but Richard Sanders objected and said it 
should go back in, and I suggested Jeff discuss with Richard. Don't know 
where that stands. 

More to follow.

1.  Can I get a copy of the FuelCell Energy purchase order form.  Jeff said 
that you would have a copy.
2.  I forwarded to you a memo from Bingham that discusses the permitting 
requirements for the proposed projects.  FYI--I plan to call Bingham today 
with some follow up questions.
3. I forwarded to you a memo by ENSR on the air permit requirements for fuel 
cells.
4.  Please let me know when you can meet today to discuss the MOU.

Kay:

Here is a proposed correction to the first sentence of section 14.3 of the
agreement.

We had offered a 15% reduction in efficiency in our warranty. When we
changed efficiency to heat rate, we neglected to correct the percentage
change because heat rate goes up as efficiency declines. Mathematically,
there is an inverse relationship (see attached spreadsheet) which means that
the equivalent of a 15% reduction in efficiency is an 18% increase in heat
rate. Therefore we propose to change the Heat Rate reduction in the first
sentence of Section 14.3 (also attached) from 15% to 18% and correspondingly
revise the total change from 20% to 23%.

Kay:  We will do a fatal flaw review and follow up.  I am following up with 
the lawyer in our CT office who I had talked to initially.  I hope that all 
is well.  It sure sounds like you all are just buried.  Speak to you soon.  
John

Hi John,

I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone
available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a
fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in
the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that
an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Where do the discussions with FCE stand?  Also, Stephen will be sending you 
the latest draft of the exhibits.  We should discuss because there are some 
interesting things in them (to our favor).

For everyone's benefit, here is how the P.O. is going to work with respect to 
specifications.  At P.O. execution, conceptual specifications ( believe that 
you all have these specs) will be attached to the P.O.  Those specifications 
will be subject to change, except the items listed in Exhibit C (Fixed 
Specifications) which will not be subject to change.  In the P.O., there will 
be an initial permitting period during which, we can cancel the P.O. at no 
cost if FCE does make additions to Exhibit C  as needed to lock in the permit 
filings (we will also propose changes to the Performance Standards if we 
reasonably believe that we can not permit the Performance Standards set forth 
in the P.O.).

Also, attached to the P.O. will be a typical unit site layout.  On this 
layout, it will identify our various points of interconnection between our 
scope of work and FCE's.  These interconnection points will be contractually 
fixed and not subject to change.  During our permitting effort, we will 
provide FCE will a site layout for each facility (using the standard unit 
layout).  FCE will only approve the layout as to access.

Eight months after release of the order, FCE will provide us with the 
engineering drawings used to bid out FCE's scope of work.  We will have two 
weeks to review and approve.  Twelve months after release of the order, FCE 
will provide us with the final specs which will be based on the engineering 
drawings.

I need you all to do the following:
 1.  Review the conceptual specifications
 2.  Review Exhibit C (below)
 3.  Give me any conditions or constraints (in language) that we would like 
to govern the process of going from the Preliminary Specifications to the 
Engineering Drawings to the Final Specifications
 4.  Any remaining comments on the Acceptance Test Protocal

Hi there,

I'm attaching the latest version of the purchase agreement.  I will prepare a

Jeff wants to get paid all project the funds as soon as the bonds are 
raised.  If we can execute all the EPC contracts by this time, he wants to be 
paid upfront with a corporate guarantee to return the money if we fail to 
pass a given plant performance test.  If we can't execute the EPC Contracts 
by this time or for the funds which are for activities outside of 
construction (i.e., development, major maintenance reserve...etc.), Jeff will 
probably want to execute a separate escrow or financial contract where we get 
to manage those funds and take some form of return (also supported with some 
form of corporate guarantee for unused funds).  I don't think that he wants 
to mention that possibility in the LOI.  We put the upfront payment on the 
EPC contract as a place holder on this concept.

Kay:  I spoke to Chuck today.  He did not come up with any "fatal flaws".  He 
said he would drop you a quick note over the weekend regarding the security 
interest/termination mechanics.  I hope that all is well.  John

Kay.Mann@enron.com> 03/13/01 09:23AM >>>
Hi John,

I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone
available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a
fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in
the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that
an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Subject: Revision No.1 for ENA Fuelcell Estimate dated 10/26/2000

Mike, 

Attached are the revised (Revision 1) BOP Estimates for the Wallingford Fuel 
Cells Power Project (10 cells - 21.2 MW) and the Midcon (Hartford) Fuel Cells 
Power Project (12 cells - 28.8 MW) in the amount of $9.5MM and $9.6 MM 
respectively. These estimates reflect our discussions today with the 
following comments provided:

 1. I have lowered the Contingency to 10% from 15% per the direction from 
Mike Coleman. Estimating does not agree with this reduced contingency and I  
feel it is inadequate for the level of detail provided.  

 2. Because of this reduction in contingency, I have re-evaluated the 
concrete account and moved the Slab on Grade from the FCE Scope to the EE&CC  
Scope of Work. I have also revised the foundations for FCE based on the 
quantities they provided. 

 3. We are using $10,000 per cell for Grounding Grid based on reviewing 
additional estimating data. (The earlier number of $75,000 for the first two 
(2) cells  and $25,000 for each additional cell was provided as an estimate 
from FCE.  We agree it is too high.

 4. Based on our discussions, we are using $450,000 per project for 
Engineering Services.

A Basis of Estimate is also provided.  

Please call if you have questions or if you want to have additional meetings.

In case you don't get this service ( I don't know how I got it, it just 
started showing up), it has a lot of info pertinent to the Conn Fuel Cell 
project . The E-Mails come at least once a week. There have been features on 
the fuel cell providers for the project, technological developments, etc.

I wanted to clarify our game plan for the next couple of weeks.

1.  Tomorrow a meeting is taking place with FuelCells to resolve some major 
outstanding business issues.  At this meeting, the point is going to be made 
that in order to maintain the desired schedule, FCE is going to have to 
increase its technical effort.  Presently, we are concerned that the 
technical aspects of the purchase order are not in sufficient order to 
finalize a purchase order by next week (we want to make certain that our deal 
with FuelCells is largely defined before we make a state filing).  We are 
going to emphasize to FCE that both sides need to devote their technical 
resources to this goal.  One of our priorities is to bring the technical 
portions of the purchase order up to the level necessary to finalize an 
order.  I need the Tony Leo list today so I can show FuelCells all the 
information that they owe us before this meeting.

2.  We have redrafted the purchase order.  However, the P.O. needs refinement 
to reflect the resolution of the outstanding business terms and to make 
certain that the technical information and procedures are clearly defined 
(much of the information that I sent you).  Given 1) the proposed payment 
mechanics and 2) FCE's lack of mature documents, we are concerned that FCE 
will try to get by with loose technical language to avoid acceptance and 
ultimately payment issues.  Also, we are concerned that once we make our 
state filing that our negotiating leverage with FCE will go down. One of our 
major focuses jobs between now and 11/3/00 is to make certain that the 
technical sections of the P.O. are properly defined.

3.  With regard to the BOP cost estimates, I would like to get the revised 
estimates no later than tomorrow.  Our current plan is to make a state filing 
(CRRA will make the filing and the filing will be the source of the funding)  
which clearly defines our basic assumptions in coming up with these estimates 
(we will not show the complete estimates) and to show conservative ranges.  
You will be given the opportunity to review and comment on the cost and 
technical information provided in the filing.  A draft of the filing is to be 
sent to CRRA by 11/3.  Given this approach, it is less important that we go 
to the sites next week.  Our focus should be on getting the purchase order 
into shape (from a technical point of view) and making sure that the state 
filing is accurate as to our base technical assumptions.

4.  The state filing is expected to be made by CRRA in the subsequent week.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Subject: Fuel Cell Exhibit C and D

Steve, Scott

Comments are as follows:

Exhibit D
Contains all modifications agreed and is acceptable.  The Repalcement Stack 
Test is missing from that document.  I am attaching Tony's draft of it. 
(Previously sent to you.)

Replacement Stack Testing:

Replacement Stack Performance Testing will be done following the replacement 
of one or both stacks on each unit.  The replacement stack performance 
testing shall be performed to asses the new stack performance level and to 
determine its contribution to the overall plant.  Replacement stack testing 
must include provisions to accurately determine stack performance and its 
contribution to the overall plant performance.  It includes detail evaluation 
of the DC to AC conversion performance in order to be able to express the new 
stack performance level in terms of plant net output and efficiency.


Exhibit C - Comment 
A major Concern is the Correction Factor for thermal cycles!  This seems to 
be a steep correction, 1% for each cycle above 2 per year.  This would 
suggest is any type of cycling is done on the plant, the repalcement stack 
could be needed as early as 1 to 2 years.
Please call to discuss
  
Exhibit C - Clarifications and Comments

Section C.1
1.  Confirm Exhaust Stack height and/or diameter  does not influence 
guarantee up to 40ft.  This is within FCE scope of supply.
2.  Confirm the stack contains EPA test ports and platform/ladders for access.

Section C.3
1.  Include drawing number and revision

Section C.4
1.  Basis Conditions and Performance Correction Factors
     Should read "Basis Conditions"

Table C.2 Site Basis Conditions
1.  Elevation above Sea Level
     Should be Ambient Barometric Pressure, psia, 14.69
2.  Footnote for wind loading indicates 30 psf, design states 24 psf.  Should 
basis also state 30 psf?  Or change to wind speed rather than load:
      --  seems design basis should be wind speed (90 mph) and contractor has 
responsibility for design interpretation of the UBC.
      --  refer to UBC chapter 23, part II - Wind Design
      --  identify Importance Factor, I, equal to 1.0 (or 1.15, as the civil 
design requires).
3.  Ambient dust loading on an annual average basis does not seem meaningful 
for performance considerations.  Use a 3-hour value?
4.  Same comment for Ambient gaseous halide concentration
       --  Have never seen reference to halides as a design basis.  Please 
explain.
5.  Note 1 does not seem to belong to Table C.2.   Relocate?


Table C.3  Fuel Compostion Range  - Clarify the impact if the gas is above 
these levels.
1.  COS
2.  0.7 grain/100 SCF is max total sulfur
3.   Same with water of 7 lb/MMscf.
4.  Odorants

C.5  Correction Factors 
1.  Is this paragraph necessary?

C.5.1)  
Table C.4  
1.  Correction factor alpha-T should be 0.84+.002*T if the factor is to be 
1.0 at T=80.

C.5.2) Elevation 
1.  Change to barometric pressure. This is the measureable quantity.  Will 
only correct for barometric pressure.
2.  Presents an equation for Max. Unit Output in terms of barometric pressure 
where the term aH is introduced.  This term should be aP.
3.  Presents an equation for the correction factor aP.
     The existing equation is:    aP =  1.17 - P x 0.0015
    Please confirm the equation should be:  aP =  1.017 - P x 0.00015  

C.5.5) Operating History 
1.  Clarify the definition of new-and-clean.  
2.  Any thermal cycles occuring during startup and commissioning and testing 
by the contractor do not count?  
3.  Is there any consideration under which degradation is applied at the 
original acceptance test?

Kay,

 Joe Curreri at ENSR wanted me to let you know that he is still waiting on 
the signed extension letter (Master Services Agreement).  Once you initial 
it, please have someone deliver it to Janet Dietrich as she then needs to 
sign it before sending it back to Joe at ENSR.  Please let me know if there 
is anything I need to do to get this process completed.  Thanks.

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, "Go, go, go."

Regards,

Heather

Here is FCE's markup of the Acceptance Procedures.  Please review and comment.

Also, I need input from you on the following matter.  Because FCE has not 
completed its final unit design, we are going to attach as an exhibit the 
conceptual unit design and allow them some freedom to make changes to the 
conceptual design in coming up with the final unit design.  What specific 
standards should we hold FCE to in coming up with the final design ( I need 
to put these standards into the P.O.).  Our fall back position is of course 
the performance tests that we will perform.  However, I would like to 
reasonably bound any design changes to items which do not materially impact 
the design quality or expected performance of the units.

Subject: Acceptance Test Guidelines


Here is our markup of the acceptance test guidelines.  The markup is minor,
basically filling in holes you asked us to fill.  The concept of plant
operating history impacts is moved from the acceptance test section to the
performance test section.  We still need to do a little work resolving two
terms which are competing for the same definition in the document:  "base
load" and "maximum guaranteed output".  We used the base load term in our
draft (probably shouldn't have) and you capitalized it.  This is no big
deal, we just need to agree on what we call it.  I didn't want to hold up
sending you the draft for that one structural detail.

Here are FCE's proposed exhibits for Pricing and the Preliminary 
specifications:

1.  Should we ask FCE's attorney to conform the Exhibits to P.O. document.  
For example, the "Final Design" term at the bottom of each page should be 
"Final Specifications."  Defined terms should be the same (Purchaser, 
Seller...etc.).

2.  We should both read the revised P.O. in the context of these exhibits.

Terri,

 Another item that I need your sign off on (besides the LHV heat rate 
calculation at 48% efficiency) is the PrelimSpecExhibit B1 attached below.  
Please look over this file, paying special attention to the spec exhibits 
(towards the back) as ENA would like to include these as attachments to the 
Purchase Order that we plan on executing with FCE. Scott and I want to make 
sure that we aren't giving FCE any wiggle room with their numbers and that we 
get engineering sign off on the reasonableness of the data.  You can ignore 
the other file as it is not applicable to engineering.  Thanks and call if 
this is not clear.

I have a couple of questions so I can wrap up the LOI:

We refer to licensed Fuel Cell Energy equipment.  Do we intend to reference a 
particular manufacturer, or should this be more generic?

Do we want to attach a draft of the Development Agreement, and condition the 
final deal on agreeing to terms substantially the same as what's in the 
draft?  I have a concern that the Enron optionality bug could bite us on the 
backside with that one.

Do we expect to have ONE EPC contract, or several?  

I'm looking for the confidentiality agreement, which may be in Bart's files 
(haven't checked closely yet).  If anyone has it handy, it could speed things 
up for me.

Thanks,

Kay

Scott,

 Here are my comments in regards to CRRA's technical questions.  FYI, Exhibit 
A is simply going to be a photocopy of FCE's expected degradation curves.  
Exhibit B is going to be a photocopy of FCE's expected water quality points.  
The plan is to have ENA make comments and then send to Tony Leo for his sign 
off and approval.  

Mike, 

 Could you please review my comments and let me know if any changes / 
additions need to be made?

Kay,

 Could you please let me know how many cycles it takes before FCE's warranty 
expires (please regard question #6)?

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

Because ENA is getting a full prepayment of the turn-key construction amount, 
I don't think that there will be a material balance sheet issue.  Worst case, 
it is easy to do off-balance sheet financing when you have cash equal to the 
total obligation.  Obviously, this will have to be vetted before the 
transaction is executed.

Kay & Jeff:  I assume that you saw this, but just in case you did not.

News that a Connecticut agency plans to install twelve fuel
cell units around the state sent the stock of FuelCell Energy up
nearly 20 percent Friday, reports Reuters. Lehman analysts
described it as the "largest fuel cell commercialization effort
anywhere in the U.S. to date" (Reuters, Mar. 23).

1.  FCE rejected Section 9.2 before.  Perhaps this provision should only be 
triggered if a specific quality problem is identified.
2.  10.1.1 (ii)--Shouldn't standard be that FCE uses commercially reasonable 
efforts to manufacture, deliver and install the Equipment in accordance with 
Exhibit N-3.
3.  10.1.2--Purchase trigger dates need to be based on when on the major 
equipment is delivered to the site in an undamaged condition.
4.  10.2.1--Shouldn't this section be eliminated?  Is this the point of 
termination schedule.  I don't want to pay FCE for shipment delays unless 
Purchaser directly and fully caused them.
5.  Section 10--Need sound guarantee.
 6.  Section 10--Where do we say that all tests will be performed on a unit 
by unit basis and in accordance with the specified protocol.
7.  Section 10.5.3--Need to incorporate FCE proposal.
8.  Section 10.6 (c)--My question on lien releases; will it be done on a unit 
by unit basis or on a facility basis?
9.  Section 10--Assuming that we adopt language that Output is the only test 
with a performance band, where do we put in the language about the purchase 
price adjustment if it is within a bound.  Even though we have not agreed to 
the % bound, we probably can write the generic language (or pull it from 
another document).
10.  Section 10.7--Add note--Waiting for response on other ENA proposal 
before deleting.

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, "Go, go, go."

Regards,

Heather

Subject: Draft LOI for CRRA

Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before.  From a substantive 
standpoint I used fuel cell energy technology as a generic, and not 
specifically relating it to FCE.  I based this on a very brief discussion I 
had with Heather, so I hope I didn't misunderstand.

I've incorporated the confidentiality agreement by reference, and included a 
brief statement that this transaction falls within its purview.  

Please let me know your comments.

FYI. I'm not sure what progress has been made on the conflict waiver, or who 
our contact is at Murtha. Kay Mann may know.

		 Subject: Murtha Cullina Conflict Waiver request

The request that I look at or find the proper person to review a conflicts 
waiver to be executed by Enron Corp. came to me from Daniel Allegretti as I 
am the lawyer working for ENA ( power assets group) in the fuel cell project 
referred to in the attachment. Sheila Tweed advised me you were the proper 
person to be looking at this matter for governmental affairs. I went ahead 
and yesterday did a markup of the requested conflicts waiver from Murtha 
Cullina to keep the ball moving and distributed that markkup internally via 
the attachment, but nothing more has happened since then. The revised waiver 
letter appended to the attachment is marked to show changes to the original 
Murtha request, so I won't forward that document to you unless you want it. 
Please give me a call at your convenience to discuss.

		 Subject: Murtha Cullina Conflict Waiver request

Attached is a suggested markup of the requested conflicts letter. Candidly, I 
don't see how Murtha can continue to represent us in lobbying for the subject 
transactions and represent CRRA in lobbying and legal representation for the 
same transactions without conflicts or creating the appearance of 
impropriety, and the markup reflects that scepticism by trying to segregate 
out the representation cleanly. Also, to the extent the original draft 
indicated Murtha had represented both CRRA and Enron re the transactions 
until now, we need to make sure that we are OK with waiving that conflict as 
a substantive matter. I'm not familiar enough with the representation to know 
if Enron's interests could have been compromised during that period of dual 
representation, and I do not think we should agree to the waiver until we are 
comfortable on that score.The letter also now  makes clear that Murtha will 
not be able to represent either party or their affiliates in litigation 
involving them. Since the letter requires the signature of Enron Corp., I'm 
trying to find out what clearance is required, as I customarily do not review 
or initial Corp. documents for signature.

Kay, John Klauberg forwarded your email requesting a "fatal flaw" review 
under Connecticut law and also your question relating to the granting of a 
security interest under the agreement.  The agreement does not appear to have 
any "fatal flaws" with respect to enforceability under Connecticut law.  
There are no liquidated damages provisions or "sole" remedy provisions that 
are often times problematic.  The contract does contain a rather extensive 
force majeure provision which we have not fully analyzed under Connecticut 
law, but the provision appears to be reasonably drafted and should not be a 
problem.  If you would like, we can take a closer look at it for precedents 
under Connecticut law.

As to the granting of the security interest and the filing of financing 
statements, we think that these provisions are reasonable for this type of 
contract and merely provide the seller with a mechanism for perfecting its 
security interest.  I have attached a memorandum that addresses this issue 
under Connecticut law.  Please call me at the number set forth below if you 
have any questions regarding this email or the attached memorandum, or if I 
may be of any other assistance.

Regards.
Chuck Welsh

Not sure this has been resolved, but I never heard back from Marty Pasqualini 
( of course, he was leaving Bingham Friday for good so not likely he made 
this a priority).

anything for offshore facilities for many years.  my lads take care of all 
eosc business currently and for the last several years but this involves 
prior (ancient) regimes.   it makes sense for me to talk to Marty but i'm 
also trying to run down the best person to speak for the offshore plants....i 
still don't see this as a problem...

We have received a request from Marty Pasqualini at Bingham Dana on behalf of 
one of his partners to waive a conflict involving the Enron Operations 
Services Corp. and the partner's client, TUV Management Services, relating to 
Bingham's proposed review on behalf of TUV of a form contract between Enron 
Operations and TUV. TUV provides monitoring , audit and other services 
related to certifications required to be made to governmental authorities. 
The subject contract relates to an ISO 9000 certification for a variety of 
Enron offshore power plants. Who is the Enron lawyer who would be familiar 
with Enron Operations Services Corp. and to whom I could direct Marty ?

Subject: Re: Stack replacement Test  

Terri, Gentlemen:

The following is the paragraph I propose we use for the "Mature Testing" 
requirements (in blue).  It would fall under exhibit D, together with the 
other two categories of performance testing already discussed and agreed to 
with FCE (Acceptance Performance Testing and Warrantee Compliance Performance 
Testing).  As a third category of performance testing, the replacement stack 
testing will be subject to all of the requirements that have been set forth 
for the other performance testing...mainly the need for an agreed to 
procedure.

Please let me know if you have nay comments, or if we need to have more or 
less details in the paragraph.

Replacement Stack Testing:

Replacement Stack Performance Testing will be done following the replacement 
of one or both stacks on each unit.  The replacement stack performance 
testing shall be performed to asses the new stack performance level and to 
determine its contribution to the overall plant.  Replacement stack testing 
must include provisions to accurately determine stack performance and its 
contribution to the overall plant performance.  It includes detail evaluation 
of the DC to AC conversion performance in order to be able to express the new 
stack performance level in terms of plant net output and efficiency.


Regards,

Tony Butler

Hi John,

Thanks for your call the other day.  The team is currently focused on getting 
the funding approved, as you can see from the attached.  Also, we have had 
some discussions with Fuel Cells about the contract to purchase the 
equipment.  I expect to forward a draft to you soon for a sanity check.  It 
may be a Connecticut law contract due to the State's involvement.  The next 
big item will be the project development agreement.  The tax credit 
monetization is still on the horizon, and if the funding approval is granted, 
we will want to talk about your sense of how that might work.

Again, thanks for checking  in.

Revised test protocol, which is now referred to as Exhibit D in the

during my edit so you can see them by clicking the other two checkboxes in
the Track Changes menu.  Note also that I am proposing that another
definition be added to the test - "Performance Test Procedures."  The
definition would read something like "Performance Test Procedures shall mean
detailed test procedures developed based on the Acceptance and Performance
Evaluation Testing Protocol (Exhibit D) which have been mutually agreed upon
by Purchaser and Seller,"

		 Subject: RE: Presentation


Given the time constraint, I thought I'd give you a brief summary of the law
here in Connecticut and some thoughts on how to proceed.

The Connecticut courts and the Freedom of Information Commission (the
"FOIC"), the agency charged with the enforcement of FOIA, have repeatedly
held that CRRA, CDA and DECD are public agencies within the purview of FOIA
(I have not had time to consider whether the same is true for DEP, CPUC and
the other attendees, but suspect that it is so with respect to certain of
them).  FOIA provides, among other things, that all documents obtained or
kept by a public agency are public records available to the public, unless
otherwise exempted from disclosure by special statute or by the exemptions
delineated by FOIA.

While there is no special statute with regard to CRRA, a special statute,
Conn. Gen. Stat. Section 32-11a(k), exempts certain materials and
information submitted to DECD and to CDA from public disclosure.  Section
32-11a(k) states that all information  contained in any application for
financial assistance submitted to DECD or CDA, and all information obtained
by the DECD or CDA with respect to any person or project is exempt from
disclosure under the FOIA.  The statute specifies that this exemption
includes all financial, credit and proprietary information.  I have not had
time to consider whether there are special statutory exemptions provided for
similar information submitted to the other attendees.

Consequently, FOIA governs the confidentiality of all information submitted
to CRRA and, perhaps, certain of the other attendees and the confidentiality
of information submitted to DECD and CDA falling outside Section 32-11a(k)'s
exemption.

As may be pertinent in these circumstances, FOIA exempts from disclosure:
(1) preliminary drafts under certain circumstances, (2) trade secrets and
commercial or financial information given in confidence, and that is not
required by statute to be disclosed to an agency, (3) real estate
appraisals, engineering or feasiblity estimates or evaluations for an agency
relative to the acquisition of property or to prospective public supply and
construction contracts, but only until such time as the property is acquired
or the transaction abandoned, (4) tax returns, reports and statements
exempted by federal law or state statutes, and (5) communications privileged
by the attorney-client relationship.

While the Connecticut courts and FOIC have held that the confidentiality of
information submitted to agencies subject to FOIA is determined by
applicable law rather that the representations or agreements of the parties,
they have suggested that measures designed to preserve confidentiality may
be considered in making that determination.

While your notice cites a May 19, 2000 Agreement of Confidentiality
previously executed by CRRA and Enron (which I have not seen), obviously
that will not be binding upon any attendees not a party to it and, while it
would be better to have the other attendees execute a written agreement
regarding confidentiality, I understand that that may not be practical given
the timing and the number of parties involved.
Accordingly, I recommend that the following other steps be employed with
respect to confidential information submitted to the attendees:

1.  All documents and information submitted to the attendees should be
marked "Preliminary Draft".

2.  In the fourth paragraph of your notice, change clause (1) to read "the
Subject Information is being provided to it in confidence, contains trade
secrets and/or confidential commercial, financial and proprietary
information and other information exempt from disclosure under certain laws
of the State of Connecticut, and it will maintain the confidentiality of the
Subject Information".

3. You should take steps, internally, to ensure the confidentiality of the
information you submit to the agencies.  Appropriate measures would include:
(a) limiting access to confidential information to a "need to know" basis,
(b) entering into confidentiality agreements with others involved in the
project with respect to their studies, analyses, etc., for the project, (c)
advising your personnel (secretarial, etc.), in writing, that the
information is confidential and of the need to maintain such information in
confidence, and (d) maintaining confidential information in locked or
otherwise private files.

5. A request should be made by you to the agencies that confidential
information  be discussed by the agencies in executive session.

If we take these measures with regard to information supplied to the
agencies, we will enhance the likelihood of maintaining the confidentiality
of the information in response to a public request for disclosure of the
information pursuant to the FOIA.  Should you wish to discuss this matter in
more detail, please do not hesitate to call me at (860) 240-2943.

Subject: Presentation




I suggest adding the attached in as the first page of text in the
presentation
materials and call the attendee's attention to it at the commencement of the
presentation. If there is a problem with its length, I would suggest
deleting
the laundry list of attendees in the first paragraph and the third paragraph
only. Also, I did not have time to check with Conn counsel on the procedures
for
public disclosure in Conn alluded to generally in the fourth paragraph, but
by
copy hereof am requesting they review the language of the Notice and give us
any
comments. When do the materials have to be distributed?

Stephen,

The comments in Blue as we discussed requires additional clarification.  The 
far field distance is that from the proposed sites to the nearest residence.

Mike:

Attached is the modified guidelines we would like FCE to use.

As explained in my previous e-mail, I have revamped the entire document to 
reflect the understanding reached during our conference call.  We have also 
tried to specify some additional things throughout the document.

I believe this is a complete and much better organize set of fuel cell 
performance evaluation guidelines.  Hopefully FCE can agree and clear the 
remaining issues which are summarized below (in blue)...

Request FCEand Developoer to do the following before guideline is complete:

A)  Clearly define differences between base load and max guarantee output.  
Guideline currently uses both of these terms as the same loading condition.
B)  FCE must review the items for which plant performance shall be corrected 
for.  I have a feeling that not enough attention was given to this subject in 
their latest review.
C)  Enron to define  far field noise measurement locations
D) FCE to confirm inclusion of items bracketed in list of auxiliaries to be 
accounted for

Larry:  I included a note in the text of the document addressing the reasons 
for removing the catalyst efficiency correction from the list of corrections 
to be used for unit output power and efficiency.

Regards,

Tony Butler

Subject: FCE Test Procedure

Tony,

I like much the reformatting job.  We should send with the following:

Identify that we have removed recently added reference to catalyst efficiency 
from list of conditions for which acceptance test performance corrections 
apply.  FCE should provide justification if required for Warrantee Compliance 
Test (as BOP system).

Request FCEand Developoer to do the following before guideline is complete:

A)  Clearly define differences between base load and max guarantee output.  
Guideline currently uses both of these terms as the same loading condition.
B)  FCE must review the items for which plant performance shall be corrected 
for.  I have a feeling that not enough attention was given to this subject in 
their latest review.
C)  Enron to define  far field noise measurement locations
D) FCE to confirm inclusion of items bracketed in list of auxiliaries to be 
accounted for

Add what else you need to say and forward to Mike.

Thanks,

Larry

Ross/Jackie,

Here's my list of comments to the most recent draft.  It is subject to 
internal review, but this gives you an idea.  Could we have a telephone 
conference to knock out as many of these as possible?  

Thanks,

Kay

According to Heather, this legislation streamlines the approval process under 
the Connecticut Siting Act. I will give you a file with the full text of the 
Act and amendments. Mark Oland at Bingham is looking at this issue and is not 
sure that Heather's reading is correct.

Hi John,

I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone 
available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a 
fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.

Thanks,

Kay

Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able 
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The 
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone 
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the 
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an 
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can 
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay

1.  Section 6.3.1 (b)--How will lien releases work?  By unit or by project?
2.  Section 6.4--Delivery Failure--if Purchaser fails to make a site 
available for delivery in accordance with the 14 day advanced notice 
procedure, don't provide highway access or we change the site after 4 month 
advanced notice; Purchaser Acceptance Failure--foundations in accordance with 
the specs (if in Purchaser scope) are not available for installation of the 
units within __ days of delivery of all the major components to site; 
purchaser fails to construct any of its BOP scope to specs within two months 
of delivery of all the major components to site.  Should be a 5 day notice 
period of a Purchaser Default.
3.  Section 6.4--Needs to say that payments are applicable to purchase price 
and that payments are subject to refund by FCE based on results of Acceptance 
Test.
4.  6.7.2--Should we set up a defined term for purchaser.  Need to be able to 
change.
5.  Section 7--I don't know where you want to insert but accounting said that 
if our Purchase Order was contingent upon full acceptance and assignment to 
RTO unless waived by ENA, we wouldn't have an issue.
