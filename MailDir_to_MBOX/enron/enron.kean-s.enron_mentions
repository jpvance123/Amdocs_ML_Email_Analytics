USA: UPDATE 1-PG&E opens bids to add 1.2 bcf of natgas in Calif.

05/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 30 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., in an effort to 
determine interest in expanding its California natural gas pipeline system, 
said it was accepting bids for up to 1.2 billion cubic feet a day (bcfd) of 
gas transport capacity. 
The move by the company, a subsidiary of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. , 
responds to California's growing demand for natural gas to run new power 
plants.
Gas suppliers and big industrial customers participating in the bidding 
round, called an open season, have until July 31 to submit offers stating how 
much pipeline capacity they are willing to purchase and the price they are 
willing to pay. 
Based on the results of this round, PG&E will decide whether to proceed with 
the planned 1.2 bcf expansion - enough to run seven 1,000 megawatt gas-fired 
power plants - or modify it to accommodate an even bigger volume of gas. 
As it stands, PG&E's open season is offering firm capacity on its its 
Redwood, Baja, and Silverado pipelines. 
These lines transport gas from Malin, Oregon; Topock, Arizona, and California 
gas production to the company's local transmission system and other 
pipelines. 
PG&E's current intrastate pipeline system can transport more than 3 bcf of 
gas a day throughout Northern and Central California. 
Over the past year, utilization rates on many California pipelines have 
jumped from 75 percent to near full capacity, limiting deliveries into the 
state needed to drive gas-fired power plants. 
Demand for gas, which already accounts for more than a third of California's 
power generation, is expected to jump. 
Since April 1999, California has approved 14 major gas-fired projects with a 
combined generation capacity of more than 9,500 megawatts. Ten gas-fired 
plants, with a total generation capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts, are 
already under construction. 
Over the past three months plans to build or expand interstate lines carrying 
gas to California have been announced by Sempra Energy unit Southern 
California Gas Co., Enron unit Transwestern, Williams Cos' unit Kern River 
Transmission, El Paso Corp. units El Paso Natural Gas Co. and Mohave Pipeline 
Co., Questar Corp. , Calpine Corp. and Kinder Morgan .

US FERC Plans Technical Conference On RTO 'Seams' Issue

05/30/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will 
hold a technical conference in June or July on the coordination of wholesale 
power transactions among regional transmission organizations, or RTOs, FERC 
Chairman Curt Hebert announced Wednesday. 
FERC is in the midst of implementing a sweeping order that directs the 
utilities it regulates to turn over their transmission assets to independent 
control by RTOs, which are slated to begin operating at the end of this year.
The order aims to promote more liquid regional wholesale power markets by 
creating independent power-grid operators, removing the remaining ability of 
vertically integrated utilities to use control of transmission to competitive 
benefit in power markets. 
In December, competitive power suppliers and industrial consumers petitioned 
the commission to convene a technical conference on what was termed the 
"seams" issue involving wholesale power transactions from one 
RTO-administered grid area to another. 
Unless the "seams" issue is addressed, "RTOs could soon resemble huge speed 
bumps which could not just slow down, but do permanent harm to the vehicle of 
competition," the petitioners warned. 
Addressing the "seams" issue is "absolutely crucial to the RTO process," 
Hebert said Wednesday, expressing the hope that the conference can be 
scheduled before July and allow FERC to "figure out the right way to do it." 
The groups that petitioned for the technical conference welcomed the decision 
to hold the technical conference. 
"It's overdue, but we appreciate the fact that it's coming about," said John 
Hughes, technical director at the Electricity Consumers Resource Council. 
ELCON represents large industrial electricity users. 
"Looking at the seams issues and addressing the seams issues successfully 
will address an awful lot of problems we see in terms of balkanized, 
dysfunctional markets," Hughes said. 
ELCON was joined in the petition by Enron Power Marketing Inc. (ENE), Reliant 
Energy Power Generation (REI) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), and the Electric Power 
Supply Association. 
EPSA, which represents competitive power producers and marketers, is 
"thrilled" that FERC will address the issue, said spokesman Mark Stultz. 
Addressing the seams issue is "critical with regard to allowing RTOs to 
function and to enhance the movement of electricity across the country," 
Stultz said. 
"If you're moving toward a national grid, as the administration has proposed 
in its national energy policy, you want to make sure you don't have 
disconnects at the seams of these RTOs," he said. 
"The more standardized the business practices for the grid the better," said 
Stultz. 
In March, the commission sought comment on whether to hold the technical 
conference. At the time, Commissioner William Massey welcomed the move, 
noting that the lack of standardized procedures could pose "an impediment to 
trade." 
Massey called for FERC to shepherd an industrywide effort to develop 
consistent standards for information and terminology regarding scheduling and 
reservation of transmission capacity among RTOs - including the development 
of "generic interface procedures." 
FERC spurred a similar standardization process in the natural gas industry, 
which resulted in creation of a Gas Industry Standards Board, or GISB. 
GISB produced uniform communications protocols for reserving pipeline 
capacity and standardized business practices, Massey noted, expressing the 
desire for the electric industry to do the same. By Bryan Lee, Dow Jones

UK Wind Pwr Co Appeals Proj Rejection In Landmark Case
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

Germana Canzi 
LONDON -(Dow Jones)- U.K. wind-power developer Ecogen Developments Ltd. said 
Wednesday it will challenge the legality of a government decision to reject 
its Humble Hill project after the Ministry of Defense said the turbines would 
interfere with surveillance radar.
The case could be an important precedent in determining the viability of a 
wave of offshore wind projects sponsored by companies such as Royal/Dutch 
Shell (RD), Enron Corp. (ENE), Powergen PLC (PWG) and TXU Corp (TXU). 
In April, the Crown Estates granted an option for the building of up to 13 
offshore power projects, which together could produce up to 1,500 megawatts 
of electricity to around one million households. 
The decision to halt the Humble Hill project took the wind power industry by 
surprise, given the strong support of wind energy by the U.K. government, 
which aims to achieve 10% of power generation from renewable sources by 2010. 
Also, in February, Energy Minister Peter Hain announced plans to cut red tape 
for wind-energy projects. The results of a consultation with the industry for 
the creation of a one-stop-shop to facilitate speedy approval of the new 
wind-farm projects is due within days. 
However, the Ministry of Defense said the objections brought against Humble 
Hill could apply potentially to other projects, including some of the 
offshore wind projects. 
"We will assess wind farms on a case-by-case basis," a Ministry of Defense 
spokesman told Dow Jones Newswires. 
In addition to wind farms located within reach of surveillance radars, 
projects within a Tactical Training Area, where aircraft can be flown at 100 
feet above ground level, may also face opposition from the Ministry of 
Defense. 
However, the Ministry said there was no "blanket ban" and that wind projects 
located close to a radar had been given the go-ahead in the past. 
Companies that may be affected by these developments include Scottish Power 
PLC (SPW), Royal/Dutch Shell and Elsam AS, which together plan to place up to 
90 wind turbines seven kilometers offshore Cleveleys in Lancashire. 
Although the Ministry of Defense hasn't raised formal objections so far, it 
has notified developers that the project is located within scope of a 
military radar, a Scottish Power spokesman said. 
"The news from the Ministry of Defense is quite disquieting," a spokeswoman 
for the British Wind Energy Association said.

India Govt Looks To Other States To Purchase Enron Power

05/30/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY -(Dow Jones)- India's federal government said Wednesday that it is 
approaching other states besides Maharashtra to see if they can buy power 
from the Dabhol Power Co., an Enron Corp. (ENE) subsidiary, in a bid to 
overcome the long-standing power supply dispute between DPC and the local 
power utility. 
"The Minister of Power has issued directions to the Central Electricity 
Authority for discussions with states that are short of power, the quantity 
of power they can absorb, and the tariff at which the power can be sold to 
them," a statement from the federal Ministry of Power said.
The statement follows the second round of talks of a negotiating panel, made 
up of officials from the federal and state governments and the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, that met DPC executives Tuesday in a bid to resolve 
their differences. 
The government statement said both the DPC and the MSEB have agreed to look 
at the options available for reducing the cost of power. 
Power tariffs, deemed "unaffordable" by the state government, are at the core 
of this dispute. 
The $3 billion Dabhol power plant, located 335 kilometers south of Bombay, 
will have a capacity of 2,184 megawatts of power when the second phase is 
completed later this year. 
The federal government also said in its statement that it is "committed to 
make all possible efforts to resolve the issues concerning the project in 
consultation with all stakeholders." 
On Tuesday, the MSEB stopped buying power from the two-year-old Dabhol plant. 
This move came five days after the MSEB told DPC that it was canceling the 
1995 Power Purchasing Agreement between the two parties that sets electricity 
prices. 
MSEB officials said Wednesday that the Dabhol plant has stopped producing 
electricity. 
"We can surmise it (the plant) is closed, for Maharashtra state is the only 
purchaser of power," said a senior MSEB official. 
He added, "The (negotiation panel) meetings are going on and when it (the 
plant) will reopen will depend on this." 
The DPC maintains that it hasn't shut down its plant. "The plant continues to 
be operational as required by the Power Purchase Agreement," said a company 
statement. 
"We will continue to follow the PPA and meet our contractual obligations, 
enforcing our rights under contracts and taking various disputes to the 
resolution process," it added.

Official: Enron plant stops producing power after power pact canceled

BOMBAY, India (AP) - A power plant run by Houston-based Enron Corp. has 
stopped producing electricity in western India following a state utility's 
decision to stop buying power from the U.S. power giant, a state official 
said Wednesday. 
A top official from the Maharashtra State Electricity Board told The 
Associated Press on condition of anonymity that the plant is probably closed, 
since the state is the plant's only customer.
The official said the plant could begin generating electricity once talks 
between the government and Enron officials resolve a dispute over a 1995 
power purchasing agreement. 
The state board stopped buying power from the 2-year-old naphtha plant 
Tuesday, amid accusations of exorbitant prices charged by Dabhol Power 
Company, Enron's Indian unit. This came five days after the MSEB notified the 
company it was canceling an agreement to buy power. 
The western Indian state of Maharashtra would not suffer a power shortage 
following the state utility's decision to stop buying Dabhol electricity, the 
board official said. 
However, a Dabhol Power Company spokesman declined to comment on the status 
of the plant, located 210 miles south of Bombay. 
The company had earlier said the state-run utility had no legal right to 
cancel the purchase agreement. 
Federal and state officials are currently negotiating with the state utility 
and Enron officials about the power purchasing agreement.

INDIA: India says committed to resolve Enron dispute.

05/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 30 (Reuters) - Indian Power Minister Suresh Prabhu said on 
Wednesday the federal government was committed to help resolve the dispute 
between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp and a local utility over a $2.9-billion 
power plant. 
"The government of India remains committed to make all possible efforts to 
resolve the issues concerning the project in consultation with all 
stakeholders," a government statement quoted Prabhu as saying.
Enron and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) have been locked in 
a wrangle over payment for power purchased by the utility. 
Earlier on Wednesday, the chairman of MSEB, the sole buyer of Enron's Dabhol 
Power Co, said the utility had stopped purchasing power from Enron. MSEB 
officials said Dabhol had stopped producing power since noon on Tuesday. 
The statement said the government had asked officials to ask power-deficient 
states about their requirement of electricity and the cost they were willing 
to pay. (New Delhi Newsroom +91-11-3012024 Fax +91-11-3014043

Bush Advisers On Energy Report Ties To Industry
By JOSEPH KAHN

The New York Times
Page 30, Column 4
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, June 2 -- At least three top White House advisers involved in 
drafting President Bush's energy strategy held stock in the Enron Corporation 
or earned fees from the large Texas-based energy trading company, which 
lobbied aggressively to shape the administration's approach to energy issues. 
Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist; Lawrence B. Lindsey, the 
top economic coordinator; and I. Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's 
chief of staff, all said in financial disclosure statement released on Friday 
that they already had or intended to divest themselves of holdings in Enron, 
the nation's leading trader and marketer of electricity and natural gas, as 
well as holdings in other energy companies.
Mr. Lindsey received $50,000 last year from Enron for consulting. Mr. Rove's 
statement said he intended to sell stock holdings in Enron valued at $100,000 
to $250,000, though the statement does not make clear if he has completed the 
sale. Mr. Libby sold his stake in the company. 
The financial disclosures for senior White House aides show that many of Mr. 
Bush's top advisers are millionaires. Among the wealthiest are Mr. Rove, Mr. 
Lindsey, Mr. Libby and Andrew H. Card Jr., the chief of staff, who earned 
$479,138.77 as chief lobbyist for General Motors and reported assets of 
$810,000 to $2.1 million. 
Mary Matalin, Mr. Cheney's senior counselor and a former political 
commentator, reported income of more than $1.5 million last year from 
speaking fees and television appearances. Her husband, James Carville, a 
Democratic commentator and political adviser, made $2.1 million last year on 
the speaking circuit, Ms. Matalin's financial disclosure shows. 
Enron was one of the largest contributors to Mr. Bush's presidential 
campaign. Kenneth L. Lay, the chairman, has close ties to Mr. Bush, as he did 
to Mr. Bush's father, and he has had considerable access to the Bush White 
House. 
The administration's energy strategy issued last month recommended opening 
protected lands to oil and gas drillers, building hundreds of power plants 
and easing some environmental controls, measures strongly favored by the 
industry. It suggested that the federal government exercise more power over 
electricity transmission networks, a longtime Enron goal. 
Mr. Lay and other Enron officials interviewed several candidates to fill 
vacancies on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which regulates Enron
's main markets. Mr. Bush selected two people for the panel who were favored 
by Enron and some other energy companies. 
White House officials have said that Enron's views were not crucial to their 
selections. ''The energy task force had a singular goal to present a plan 
that best addressed America's energy needs,'' a White House spokeswoman said. 
''Any decisions made as part of that process were made with that one goal in 
mind.'' The spokeswoman said the White House counsel's office had worked with 
all officials to ensure they met the highest ethical standards. 
Administration links to energy companies are wide ranging. Condoleezza Rice, 
the national security adviser, had stock holdings of $250,000 to $500,000 in 
the Chevron Corporation and earned $60,000 as a director of the company in 
the last year. She resigned her position and sold her shares. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding a stake in 
El Paso Energy Partners valued at $100,000 to $250,000. El Paso is a Houston 
oil and natural gas company. As part of his White House duties, Mr. Johnson 
has been involved in selecting people to fill vacancies at the energy 
regulatory commission, which oversees the natural gas market. 
There was no indication in his disclosure statement that Mr. Johnson intended 
to sell his stake in El Paso. 
The stakes in Enron held by Mr. Rove and Mr. Libby were part of diversified 
stock portfolios. Mr. Rove also reported investments in BP Amoco and Royal 
Dutch Shell, as well as several leading pharmaceutical, technology and 
financial companies. Mr. Libby, a lawyer, sold tens of thousands of dollars' 
worth of energy stocks. They included Texaco, Exxon Mobil and Chesapeake 
Energy as well as Enron. 
Mr. Lindsey, the director of the National Economic Council, reported the most 
ties to major American and international companies. His Washington consulting 
firm, Economic Strategies Inc., advised 67 leading American, European and 
Japanese banks and businesses, including American Express and Citibank. Mr. 
Lindsey was paid an annual salary of $918,785. He also reported $50,000 in 
consulting fees from Crow Family Holdings, a Dallas real estate concern, and 
Moore Capital, a leading hedge fund, as well as Enron.

Watt Price Ideology?
By PAUL KRUGMAN

06/03/2001
The New York Times
Page 17, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

I once had a math teacher who responded to student errors by saying ''Save 
that answer -- I may ask that question someday.'' I thought of him after 
George W. Bush's apparently pointless trip to California.
During that trip, Gov. Gray Davis asked for a temporary cap on wholesale 
electricity prices -- a request that gained extra force because it was backed 
by economists with strong pro-market credentials, including Alfred Kahn, who 
oversaw the deregulation of airlines, trucking and other industries in the 
1970's. Mr. Bush, however, was unmoved. Again and again he declared that a 
price cap would do nothing either to increase supply or to reduce demand. 
Save that answer, Mr. Bush. We might ask that question someday. 
Actually, Mr. Bush's assertion may have been wrong even on its own terms. 
I'll come back to that in a minute. But the most striking thing about his 
declaration was that it had nothing to do with the actual problem. 
For the issue facing California right now is not how to increase supply and 
reduce demand. It's too late for that; summer is almost upon us, and it is 
simply a fact of life that there will be power shortages in the months ahead. 
It is important that the state build power plants as quickly as possible, so 
that this shortage is only temporary. But not to worry: power plants are 
being built at a furious rate, in California and in the nation at large. 
Indeed, last week the credit agency Standard & Poor's expressed concern that 
electric generating capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will 
soon face a glut. 
Meanwhile, however, the temporary lack of capacity has led to incredibly high 
wholesale electricity prices, which are a huge financial burden on the state, 
over and above any disruption that may be caused by physical shortages of 
power. Nobody knows exactly how much California will pay for power this year, 
but reasonable estimates suggest that it will pay at least $50 billion more 
than two years ago -- an increase of more than $1,500 for every resident. The 
great bulk of that represents not an increased cost of production but 
windfall profits for a handful of generating companies. 
The main purpose of a temporary price cap would be to reduce -- though by no 
means eliminate -- this transfer of wealth away from California residents. 
That is, we're talking about dollars, not megawatts. And Mr. Bush's response 
is therefore almost surrealistically beside the point. 
You could argue that any financial benefit from price caps would be more than 
offset by a worsened physical shortage. But that's a hard case to make. 
Nobody has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power 
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the supply of power? 
It's true that Econ 101 teaches that price controls tend to produce 
shortages. But this would be a minor effect in this case, since neither 
production nor consumption would be much affected. And anyway, students who 
go beyond Econ 101 learn that strictly speaking the standard argument against 
price controls applies only to a competitive industry. A price ceiling 
imposed on a monopolist need not cause a shortage, if it is set high enough; 
indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually lead to higher output. 
That's not an argument you want to use too often, but given the extraordinary 
prices now being charged for electricity, and the considerable evidence that 
producers are exercising monopoly power, if ever there was a case for a 
temporary price ceiling, California's electricity market is the place. 
I am actually somewhat surprised by Mr. Bush's obtuseness on this whole 
subject. No doubt his determination to answer the wrong question is 
deliberate: misrepresenting policy issues is, after all, standard operating 
procedure for this administration. But even on a cynical political 
calculation, Mr. Bush's remarks seem to be foolish, only reinforcing the 
sense that he neither understands nor cares about California's problems. 
Maybe Mr. Bush's advisers are knee-jerk ideologues who believe that the 
market is always right, even when textbook economics says it is wrong. Or 
maybe they are so close personally to energy industry executives that they 
believe that whatever is good for Enron is good for America. 
Whatever the real story, it's clear that this administration not only has no 
answers for California, it won't even listen to the question.

The Nation THE ENERGY CRISIS Watchdogs Take a Hit in State's Power Ills 
Energy: Ex-federal officials say oversight of California's deregulation 
suffered due to a push for free-market competition.

WASHINGTON -- California was the first test, and right from the start 
economists at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission saw trouble coming. 
Their bosses were worried too. In hindsight, some admit they could have done 
better. 
But five years ago, when California officials were rushing to deregulate 
electricity, the federal watchdog charged by law with overseeing the process 
and guarding against runaway prices decided not to bark.
In their zeal for free-market competition and their ideological commitment to 
shifting authority away from Washington to the states, FERC's commissioners 
brushed aside their qualms and let the process roll forward. 
"There were a lot of issues that got swept under the rug," said economist 
Carolyn A. Berry, who headed FERC's analysis of the California plan. "We were 
trying to point out the ugly warts, but it wasn't our job to set policy." 
Former FERC Chairman James J. Hoecker, who presided over the approval, said 
the agency "should have been far less deferential." John Rozsa, a state 
legislative analyst who played a key role in the deregulation law, laughed 
when he heard that. "FERC wanted it badly," he said. 
Today, FERC stands accused of failing to exercise its oversight, enforcement 
and political muscle just when they were needed most. The agency, critics on 
the inside and outside agree, helped launch a radical economics experiment 
without sufficient preparation, adequate staff or a clear sense of how to 
carry out its mission. 
With fully half the states considering deregulation, the story of what a 
previously obscure federal agency did not do has become more than a case 
study in regulatory shortcomings. It has become a warning shot across the bow 
of the whole country. 
FERC has approved deregulation plans in New England, New York and the 
mid-Atlantic states. At stake is a reliable supply of a commodity that fuels 
virtually every home and workplace in America. California's example is hardly 
encouraging: months of blackouts and an electric bill that has rocketed from 
$7 billion in 1999 to as much as $50 billion this year. 
Now the commission is caught in what some see as an identity crisis, divided 
and uncertain as politicians in California and Washington call for mutually 
contradictory action. 
"I think the commission needs to decide what it wants to do when it grows 
up," said Hoecker, who headed the agency during a critical period ending in 
January. His own leadership, he concedes, was not always all it might have 
been. 
Without question, there is ample blame for everyone, not just FERC. Certainly 
in California, state officials devised a flawed deregulation scheme and then 
insisted on carrying it out. Some power company executives have extracted 
windfall profits. Politicians have wilted when things went awry. 
And, as FERC officials continually point out, its authority is limited to 
wholesale markets. State officials are responsible for the local utilities 
and other retailers selling power to consumers. 
Nonetheless, it is FERC that Congress charged with overseeing electricity 
markets and assuring "just and reasonable" prices. 
How did FERC choose the course it took? What factors influenced its 
decisions? 
Certainly energy companies, consumer advocates, lawmakers and others lobbied 
the agency. 
Yet even FERC critics say such influence was not dominant. FERC is not 
insulated from lobbying, but David Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save 
Energy, a coalition of business, consumer and environmental leaders, said: 
"They are less sensitive to those forces than a lot of other players." 
Rather, this seems to have been a case of government decisions driven by 
ideology. The commissioners, both Republicans and Democrats, were wedded to 
the idea that deregulation at the wholesale level would lead to lower retail 
bills. The market, they believed, would inexorably produce greater 
competition, greater efficiency and falling prices. 
To Mark Cooper of the Consumer Federation of America, the primary problem was 
"their excessive faith in the market." 
Even after price spikes occurred across the Midwest and in California as 
early as 1998, FERC officials dismissed suggestions the surges might reflect 
market instability or manipulation. 
And as California's situation worsened, FERC's response was shaped by a 
continuing commitment to market forces with a minimum of government 
intervention--witness its April order allowing temporary price caps but only 
in narrowly defined emergencies. 
In the last few months, under enormous pressure, FERC has ordered a dozen 
companies to justify high prices or refund $124.5 million to California 
utilities for January and February. It won an $8-million settlement from 
Williams Cos. of Tulsa, Okla., which it had accused of shutting power plants 
last spring to drive up prices. Williams did not admit guilt. 
Detractors, including California officials, howl that FERC's actions are too 
little too late. They have called for a range of solutions, from flat-out 
price caps, as in the old days of full regulation, to much higher rebates 
from generators caught price-gouging, to retractions of individual firms' 
permission to charge market-based rates. 
If the agency chose to wield all of its authority, it also could force 
witnesses to testify under oath and subpoena tapes of phone calls among power 
traders, and even force the state to change the way the market operates. 
Curtis L. Hebert Jr., the free-market champion who succeeded Hoecker as 
chairman, insisted "FERC is being vigilant in its efforts to ensure just and 
reasonable rates, while at the same time ensuring" that it fosters new energy 
supplies. 
"I would vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise," he added, 
noting he transferred 75 attorneys--half of the agency's litigators--into 
market oversight. 
Still, a consensus that it's time for aggressive action seems to be forming 
among commissioners, including two nominees confirmed by the Senate last 
month: Patrick H. Wood III and Nora M. Brownell. 
Wood, a Texas utility regulator nominated by Bush and probably FERC's next 
chairman, said the agency needs to evolve into a "market cop with a great big 
old stick," adding: "There is a role that only the federal government can 
take. . . . The free market ain't a free and full market yet." 
Already named FERC's special liaison for California, Wood remains dedicated 
to market principles but vows to take a fresh look. 
Commissioner Linda Breathitt, a Democrat, also talks of change. And 
commissioner William L. Massey describes agency officials as naive in their 
past actions, in contrast to what he calls the "very sophisticated players" 
on the industry side. 
If some commissioners are starting to sound more like watchdogs, that's 
partly because they feel the tug of two conflicting ideas in their mandate to 
open markets while assuring fair prices. 
Americans have always loved the way capitalism gives opportunities to the 
shrewd and energetic. At the same time, the country has repeatedly turned to 
government regulation when it thought particular industries, such as the 
railroads, waxed too powerful. 
How well FERC deals with this intrinsic conflict and meets its challenges may 
have a sizable effect on the country's energy future. 
Frightened by events on the West Coast, some states have slowed their 
progress toward deregulation. Others have decided not to try at all, at least 
for now. 
"If the commission wants to have competitive markets," Hoecker said, "it's 
going to have to pull the bacon out of the fire." 
Though it traces roots back to the Federal Power Commission and development 
of hydroelectric power in the 1920s, FERC began its present incarnation in 
the 1980s, with the Reagan administration's deregulation campaign. 
FERC undertook to deregulate natural gas, then, spurred by a Democratic 
Congress and the first President Bush, it moved on to electricity. 
The problem is that electricity and its markets differ significantly from 
natural gas. Electric power cannot be stored to meet future shortages, as gas 
can. Its markets are more volatile. And the effect of shortages or price 
spikes cascades through the economy much faster. 
Without anyone quite realizing it, FERC was sailing into uncharted waters. 
Moreover, as FERC's staff took up the original California deregulation plan, 
it faced a significant constraint: The commissioners had made a conscious 
call to let the state have its way most of the time. 
As state officials saw it, so much power was available for the Western 
electrical grid that prices would surely come down. FERC economists, on the 
other hand, saw myriad problems. 
For example, the state's scheme called for generators to submit blind bids 
with a separate quote for each hour of the coming day. With any power plant, 
the unit cost is highest when a generator is started up and declines as it 
runs. So the price charged for later hours should be lower than for the 
first--but only if the operator can sell both the beginning and the later 
hours. 
Under the California blueprint, though, bidders could not be sure which hours 
the purchaser might buy. That meant bidders would have to load the higher 
start-up costs into each hour throughout the cycle to make sure those costs 
were recovered. By contrast, the mid-Atlantic market requires the power 
purchaser to add separate payments to cover start-up costs. 
Other issues were deferred rather than solved before FERC granted approval, 
including such questions as how to manage congestion on the grid and what the 
transmission rights should be for municipalities that generated and sold 
power. 
State legislative aide Rozsa argues that such matters were not crucial and 
that the biggest flaw in the plan--the insistence that the system operator 
not have any generators of its own--was conceived with FERC guidance. Both 
FERC and the state, he said, had "an exaggerated sense of their knowledge and 
ability." 
As the California launch, originally scheduled for January 1998, drew near, 
FERC's nervousness increased. As late as the Christmas holidays, the state 
was still tinkering. The agency ordered the state to provide two weeks' 
written notice before taking the final step, even though FERC had already 
approved the plan. 
When California finally "went to market," FERC analysts snickered at the 
timing: The first electricity auction was held March 31 for power to be 
delivered the next day--April Fool's Day. 
As for the commissioners, "We were somewhat naive," Massey said. "The 
commission believed there was so much inefficiency built into the 
old-fashioned . . . regime that any new market would be better." 
With the nation's largest state deregulating, FERC began blessing plans on 
the East Coast. Hundreds of companies lined up for permission to charge 
market rates in various open trade zones. 
FERC, according to its rules, was supposed to reject any firm that held a big 
enough share in a market--generally defined as about 20%--to influence prices 
for a sustained period. But doing the necessary market analyses proved 
impractical. 
For one thing, the rising workload was overwhelming the staff, which had 
shrunk by more than 25% from its 1980 high of 1,600 employees. The agency, as 
critics see it, simply buckled. 
"Once it got going, it took over," Berry said of the momentum behind 
deregulation. "FERC was handing out [permission] to anybody who walked in." 
FERC economist Steven A. Stoft was infuriated. He wanted to start cautiously, 
opening one small market, testing before expanding nationally. 
"To put in markets everywhere, to affect a lot of people, to just wait and 
see how it turns out, that's completely irresponsible," said Stoft, who now 
lives in California and is writing a book for regulators about how to design 
markets. 
At first, the staff Cassandras seemed wrong. Prices generally headed down. 
But during the summer of 1998, prices spiked twice--once in the Midwest, once 
in California. 
In the Midwest, several aging nuclear plants shut down for maintenance just 
as a heat wave sent air conditioners into overdrive. Wholesale electricity 
rose past $7,000 per megawatt-hour, 100 times normal. Consumers and 
politicians screamed. 
The weather cooled and new supply came in fast. Prices ebbed. 
To consumer groups and several FERC economists, the sudden increase suggested 
the worst can happen. Hoecker and FERC member Vicky Bailey drew a different 
lesson, as did a staff investigation: The market worked to correct an unusual 
confluence of events that was unlikely to recur. 
About the same time, a strange thing happened in California's reserve market, 
where the state's independent system operator pays generators with extra 
capacity to stand ready to meet unexpected surges in demand. 
So few companies offered to sign such contracts that the ISO sometimes had 
little choice but to accept whatever bid came in. It was just a matter of 
time before someone took advantage. One day in that summer of 1998 someone 
did: The only offer to provide reserve power was an astronomical $9,999 per 
megawatt-hour. 
To some, it was proof that the California market could--and would--be 
manipulated. "I was horrified," Berry said. 
FERC quickly granted California's request for permission to cap prices in the 
reserve. The authority quietly expired in November. There was no outcry about 
this spike because reserve costs are spread around to the states' utilities, 
thus diffusing their effect. 
"Of course, it should have been a warning that the sellers were several steps 
ahead of us," commissioner Massey says. 
In a memo last June, Ron Rattey, a senior FERC economist who has been with 
FERC since 1975, complained that the staff was "impotent in our ability to 
monitor, foster and ensure competitive electric power markets." He added in 
an interview: "FERC doesn't want todiscover that the policy changes it's 
making aren't working." 
Commissioners at the quasi-judicial agency are forbidden by law from 
privately discussing pending cases. So companies and Congress must officially 
content themselves with filing briefs, writing letters and testifying at 
hearings. 
No such restraints apply to the issue of who sits on the commission. There, 
the jockeying for influence can be intense. 
Commissioners are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to 
staggered five-year terms, with a limit of three members of a political party 
on the panel. The president can also designate at any time which commissioner 
serves as chairman, a position that bestows broad authority over the FERC's 
agenda and staff. 
When Bush took office, he picked Hebert, then the lone Republican on the 
commission, to the chairmanship and named his choices for the two vacancies. 
It was unclear whether Hebert would keep the chair once Bush's nominees were 
confirmed. 
Soon afterward, Hebert talked by telephone with Kenneth L. Lay, who heads 
Enron Corp., a Houston-based energy marketing giant that recently saw its 
profits triple in a year. FERC policy decisions could have a huge influence 
on its future. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer says Lay, whose friendship with Bush is well 
known, was returning a call from Hebert. Palmer says Hebert wanted Lay's 
support for remaining chairman. 
Hebert told a FERC official, who heard the new chairman's end of the 
conversation, that Lay offered support but only if the chairman changed his 
views in ways that would aid Enron. The official says he heard Hebert decline 
and characterizes him as offended. The discussion was first reported in the 
New York Times. 
Lay has never been shy about offering advice, nor about courting political 
access. He golfed with President Clinton, and Palmer wrote a letter to 
Clinton's personnel chief touting Hoecker for chairman. The Enron executive's 
ties with Bush bind especially tight; Lay raised and donated hundreds of 
thousands of dollars to Bush's campaigns and related efforts. 
Power companies also scouted candidates for the two slots. Enron went so far 
as to send the White House a list of a dozen people Lay considered qualified 
(the two new commissioners were on it). 
In the end, however, the evidence suggests that such lobbying mattered less 
than the faith in free markets and less federal intervention shared by two 
presidents and just about every recent FERC member. "FERC is filled with true 
believers," Rozsa said. 
The agency's recent California orders underline the point. In December, FERC 
concluded the market was dysfunctional and ordered a limited version of the 
price caps that free marketers abhor. 
Still, prices remained above $300 a megawatt-hour--10 times the pre-crisis 
average. So in April, FERC concluded it had to take further action. 
But the new version of price caps, approved 2 to 1, actually narrowed the 
circumstances under which they could be imposed, though it gave the state 
more flexibility. Even temporarily, the commission would not abandon its 
market principles. 
"I was reluctant to stop in my tracks," said Breathitt, the swing vote. She 
didn't want "to go back to a form of regulation that this commission and I 
had departed from five or six years ago."

Q&A 
Differences in the approaches of the three most senior members of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission were apparent during recent interviews with The 
Times. Following are excerpts: 
* 
How do you define FERC's role as a regulator of wholesale electricity? 
HEBERT: "What the commission has attempted to do here since I've been 
chairman is to provide a balance--making certain that we have just and 
reasonable rates and, at the same time, making certain that we have given 
proper opportunity to build out infrastructure and to add much-needed supply 
so as to correct the flawed market that California has put in place." 
BREATHITT: "It is being an effective referee. It's being a cop on the beat. 
It's being a nurturer of competition. It's being an arbiter of disputes. And 
it's overseeing a level playing field. And, also, its role--more than we've 
seen in the past--is going to be a place to listen to the energy consumer." 
* 
Is FERC effectively monitoring wholesale electric markets and enforcing "just 
and reasonable" rates? 
HEBERT: "I think FERC is using any and all tools available to it to 
adequately monitor the markets, continue to look 24 hours, seven days a week 
for market manipulation, and ensure just and reasonable rates. I would 
vehemently disagree with anyone who says otherwise." 
MASSEY: "We need more people dealing with the monitoring function. The 
monitoring function requires skills that are precise. I think we need more 
people involved in hard-nosed investigation work . . . everyone here realizes 
we still have to do better in that regard." 
BREATHITT: "This is new to us. We've been monitoring markets in an old way. 
We have to get better at monitoring markets within the current framework." 
* 
Should FERC revise the test it uses to determine whether a power generator 
has "market power"? 
HEBERT: "Obviously, if I thought we needed to change it, we would have." 
MASSEY: "We have this old horse-and-buggy methodology for determining whether 
generators have market power. Everybody passes, nobody ever fails. If we've 
learned nothing else, it's that the screen is not sensitive enough to pick up 
the exercise of market power in California. . . . I don't know how you can 
say you see no reason for change." 
* 
Have wholesale power generators exercised market power to manipulate rates in 
California? 
HEBERT: "I know there are several people in the state of California that 
continually make remarks, some of them that are completely unnecessary [about 
manipulation of markets]. If they have information and real evidence, this 
commission wants to know about it . . . But this anecdotal evidence that they 
bring forward and is not real is not helpful." 
MASSEY: "In a capacity-short market where they need all the generation, even 
a small company can exercise market power. I'm not talking about some kind of 
conspiracy. I'm talking about the kind of conduct you would expect from a 
tough, hard-nosed, profit-maximizing company that owns generation." 
* 
Did FERC's April 26 order imposing price caps in California during emergency 
hours go far enough? 
HEBERT: "I embrace the order; I think it will make a real difference. And I 
wish there was some way to take California through the experience without the 
price mitigation and show the proof that the price mitigation is going to 
bear in trying to level out prices while at the same time giving signals to 
build out infrastructure and needed supply." 
MASSEY: "I don't think we've moved quickly enough. Generally, our solutions 
have been too little too late. We've been hoping the market will settle down, 
and it just hasn't . . . we should have imposed a timeout . . . on that 
market to cool it off." 
BREATHITT: "I wanted it to mitigate against high prices. I wanted it to have 
a market orientation. And I wanted it to be effective in controlling what I 
thought would be high prices this summer. . . . We did control prices on 
April 26." 
* 
Has FERC resolved the question of "just and reasonable" rates in California? 
HEBERT: "When it comes to just and reasonable rates, you cannot just pick a 
price at which no one should pay over, or be allowed to pay over, because you 
have to give the proper opportunity for infrastructure and supply. . . . We 
are addressing it and we will fully address all the legal arguments on it in 
these rehearings pending on recent California orders." 
BREATHITT: "This order, I think, will produce just and reasonable rates given 
the shortage of supply in California." 
MASSEY: "We haven't really defined it. I would define it as cost-of-service 
regulation or price disciplined by a well-functioning market. We don't have 
either of those."

Saudi Arabia Sets Pacts With 9 Oil Firms

06/03/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Associated Press 
JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil 
companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in its 
energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s.
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development 
of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related 
power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects. 
Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is 
the lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar 
Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 
project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD, SC) was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core 
Venture 3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil 
burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil 
for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC (BP), TotalFinaElf SA (TOT), Conoco 
Inc. (COCA, COCB), Phillips Petroleum Co. (P), Occidental Petroleum Corp. 
(OXY), Enron Corp. (ENE) and Marathon Oil Canada Inc. (MRO). 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the 
Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed 
its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion 
in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it 
is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons 
from Saudi Aramco.

INDIA: INTERVIEW-India to respect international contracts - Prabhu.
By Clarence Fernandez

06/03/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India is in favour of ensuring international 
contracts are respected, Power Minister Suresh Prabhu told Reuters as 
investors' fears grow over a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
and a local utility. 
The row was sparked late last year when the utility in India's western state 
of Maharashtra defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 
65 percent owned by Houston-based Enron.
Prabhu said it was obvious investors saw some question marks over Enron's 
$2.9 billion power plant, which is India's largest private foreign 
investment. 
Enron is building the plant but the dispute with the local utility, 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, has threatened to derail the 2,184 MW 
power project. 
"We have to address those concerns adequately because the government of India 
is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are respected 
in the process of assuring all the foreign investors that there is no need 
for concern," Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday. 
Signs emerged last week that investors are souring on India. 
Global rating agency Fitch last Thursday revised India's sovereign rating 
outlook to negative from stable, citing concerns over fiscal policy, 
privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. 
Competing agency Moody's said on Friday it has seen slippage in the Indian 
government's reform effort, but declined to say whether a ratings change 
could be expected, while Standard & Poor's (S&P) said it was worried about 
the size of the budget deficit. 
Asked if he felt the Enron row had deterred investors, Prabhu said, "This is 
one single issue. We must deal with it in the manner in which it is possible 
in a given situation. 
"There is a negotiation going on. The central government has a representative 
on the negotiating committee and I am sure that the only way in which 
commercial disputes can be settled is through negotiations." 
Prabhu was referring to a panel formed last month by the Maharashtra state 
government to renegotiate the tariffs charged by the 2,184-MW Dabhol power 
project. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which agreed in 1995 to buy 
the plant's entire output, says the power is too costly and has defaulted on 
$48 million in power payments. 
Dabhol issued a notice last month to cancel its power purchase deal, a move 
many investors fear could be the first step towards getting out of the 
project entirely. 
"The phase in which we are right now ... is the phase in which some 
independent power producers have already contracted certain obligations which 
we will definitely like to uphold, which should be honoured," Prabhu added. 
"Because in India contracts are very important. Sanctity of contracts should 
be kept."

Saudi Arabia signs landmark agreement with major oil companies

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) - Saudi Arabia and nine major international oil 
companies signed a landmark agreement Sunday that marks the first major 
foreign investment in the Saudi energy sector since the industry was 
nationalized in the mid 1970s. 
The deal, worth at least dlrs 25 billion, involves the development of three 
natural gas fields in the kingdom, and a number of related power plants, 
transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
Irving, Texas-based Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil 
company, will lead management position for two of the projects, including the 
dlrs 12-16 billion Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red 
Sea Coast Core Venture 2 project. Shell was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core 
Venture 3 project. The last two projects have a value of dlrs 7-10 billion 
each, Prince Saud al-Faisal told reporters. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from 
oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude 
oil for export. 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the companies are expected to profit on 
returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with more than 15 
percent of the investment cost. 
The other companies selected were BP, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips 
Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon. 
King Fahd, who rarely appears before foreign visitors, attended the signing 
and shook hands at the conclusion of the deal with the presidents of the 
companies. 
Also present was Crown Prince Abdullah, Defense Minister Prince Sultan and 
Prince al-Faisal, who signed the agreements on behalf of the kingdom. 
The signing was rich in pomp as members of the royal family sat along the 
back wall, with Fahd at the center. Oil company executives sat along one side 
and other Saudi officials, including al-Naimi, sat on the other. The 
executives took turns signing the memorandum of understandings. At the 
conclusion of the signing, they took turns shaking Fahd's hand. Each could be 
heard saying "Thank you very much" to Fahd. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the 
Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and closed 
its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Al-Faisal said in case the companies discover oil, they will be compensated 
and the fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has invested 
dlrs 5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country 
and said it is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other 
hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

India struggles to keep foreign investors
Uttara Choudhury

06/03/2001
Agence France-Presse
(Copyright 2001)

NEW DELHI, June 3 (AFP) - Foreign investors are beginning to leave India for 
emerging economies like China, as they run smack into a cobweb of rules, 
regulations and intervention at the state level. 
The list of companies leaving India, after moving in en masse during the 
early 1990s when the government unleashed sweeping free- market reforms, 
include major European, American and Asian groups.
"A slew of foreign firms have packed their bags. It is a wake up call for New 
Delhi to cut red tape and pursue much more investor- friendly policies," said 
Gautam Mahajan, president of the Indo- American Chamber of Commerce. 
Four foreign power companies, including Europe's largest, Electricite de 
France (EDF), have pulled out of Indian power projects worth three billion 
dollars, citing long delays and the slow pace of reforms. 
EDF walked out of a proposed 1,000-megawatt power project in the western 
Indian state of Maharashtra following years of hurdles and hold-ups. 
Ramesh Narayan, chief of EDF's subsidiary in India, told AFP that 
"inordinately long" delays forced it to pull out of the 1.1 billion dollar 
joint venture, which also includes France's Alstom. 
"We gave it a long, hard try for seven years... The coal-pricing and risk 
issues finally made the project unviable. Recent regulatory changes also made 
the project's tariff unacceptable," said Narayan. 
While EDF struggled to get off the ground in India it added 34,000 megawatts 
of power in countries such as Germany and China. 
The pull out of EDF followed the withdrawal in January last year of US-based 
Cogentrix Energy Inc., from a 1.3 billion dollar, 1,000- megawatt power 
project in the southern state of Karnataka. 
Now another US energy giant, Enron Corp., has moved closer to pulling the 
plug on its Indian plant. 
On May 19, Enron subsidiary Dabhol Power Company (DPC) issued a preliminary 
notice to terminate its contract to sell power to India's Maharashtra state. 
The move followed months of wrangling between Enron and Maharashtra state 
over payment defaults by the state utility, Maharashtra State Electricity 
Borad, and is likely to further tarnish India's business image. 
"It will have an impact on how people look at India and that is very 
unfortunate because we do see India as a potentially good market," Peter de 
Wit, director of Shell International Gas told reporters. 
"The sort of circumstance they (Enron) are faced with now doesn't give a lot 
of confidence to people who want to consider long-term contracts in India." 
Shell plans to spend 19.5 billion rupees (415 million dollars) to build a 
five million ton-a-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal at Hazira, a 
port in the western state of Gujarat. 
The Dabhol project is the single largest US investment in India and was seen 
as a litmus test of India's commitment to economic reforms and globalisation. 
Australian telecoms group United Holdings and its Korean supplier Mocomo Inc 
announced last month the closure of an electronic parts production facility 
in northern India, sacking at least 200 people, to relocate to China. 
Foreign firms also said it took them longer to start operations in India. 
France's leading liquor company Groupe Pernod Ricard took roughly four years 
to launch its first brand in India. 
"I started Pernod's operations from scratch in Japan and Korea. I came to 
India with the clear intention of quickly launching our first brand," said 
Albert Algressi, former Delhi head of Groupe Pernod Ricard, before leaving 
India. 
"But a few weeks became some months then years. Very frustrating," he added. 
An executive with U.S consultancy firm McKinsey and Company said 
multinational companies tried to duplicate "tried and tested models in India, 
but India was a model of its own". 
"A bureaucrat will say 'very good' and then not clear the project. The local 
partner says 'no problem' and this could be the beginning of all your 
problems," said the consultant. 
India said foreign direct investment (FDI) in 2000 jumped by 15 percent to 
193.4 billion rupees (4.2 billion dollars) from the previous year. 
However, a commerce ministry report stated that in the first decade of its 
economic liberalisation India only managed to attract FDI worth 23.7 billion 
dollars, a little more than what China receives in six months.

`Expert knowledge' and Dabhol
A V Rajwade

It has now been a few weeks since the appointment of a committee under Mr 
Godbole to renegotiate the tariffs payable to the Dabhol Power Company Ltd by 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). There has been hardly any 
tangible progress in the negotiations. Legal notices issued by either side 
have been flying around but the problem remains intractable. 
At present neither DPC, nor its parent Enron, has any incentive whatsoever to 
hold serious negotiations. It is sitting pretty on an agreement that one can 
be sure has been drafted by some very clever lawyers. And given that all 
obligations of MSEB are guaranteed by the Government of India, it probably is 
not too worried about the safety of its money. It also knows that, in the 
interest of its international reputation, the Indian authorities cannot 
afford to take a cavalier attitude to the subject.
In the circumstances, if progress is to be achieved, some way will have to be 
found to get Enron worried about the legal enforceability of its agreements. 
Only if this happens will Enron be persuaded to start a serious renegotiation 
of the tariffs. In an earlier article in this newspaper (see Business 
Standard May 22, 2001), I had referred to the now famous Procter & Gamble vs 
Bankers Trust Company case in the United States. While I have not been able 
to get hold of the P&G plaint despite an extensive search on the Web, I have 
managed to get hold of a copy of the judgement in the case. This has 
limitations because the substance of the dispute was settled out of court. 
And yet the judgement does make a few useful points. 
The bulk of the judgement discusses arcane points of law, in particular the 
applicability of various legislations in the United States to the case. On 
most of these points the judge has rejected the contentions of Procter & 
Gamble, and granted summary judgement in favour of Bankers Trust. However, 
the judge goes on to argue that: "This does not mean, however, that there are 
no duties and obligations in their swaps transactions. Plaintiff alleges that 
in the negotiation of the two swaps and in their execution, defendants failed 
to disclose vital information and made material misrepresentations to it_ 
"New York case law establishes an implied contractual duty to disclose in 
business negotiations. Such a duty may arise where 1) a party has superior 
knowledge of certain information; 2) that information is not readily 
available to the other party; and 3) the first party knows that the second 
party is acting on the basis of mistaken knowledge_ 
"Additional cases which explicate the duty to disclose indicate that a duty 
may arise when one party to a contract has superior knowledge which is not 
available to both parties_" 
"Even though a fiduciary duty may not exist between the parties, this duty to 
disclose can arise independently because of superior knowledge_" 
"The duty to deal fairly and in good faith requires affirmative action even 
though not expressly provided for by the agreement_" 
"I conclude that defendants had a duty to disclose material information to 
plaintiff both before the parties entered into the swap transactions and in 
their performance, and also a duty to deal fairly and in good faith during 
the performance of the swap transactions_" 
The judge has cited a number of court cases in support of these points which 
seem to be based more on case law and common law principles than on any 
specific legislation. As such, one would imagine that the enunciated 
principles would have wider application than narrow infringements of specific 
laws. 
In the May 22 article, I had referred to the discount factor of 17 per cent 
per annum which seems to have been used to calculate the present value of the 
fixed cost payable by MSEB to DPC. The discount rate is an inferred one from 
the available data; it seems that the actual rate of discount used is not 
available in any of the documents. This is surprising; one obvious reason 
could be that, for what are effectively dollar payments, a 17 per cent 
discount rate is absurd and it was obviously better not to bring it on 
record. Can its non-disclosure in the negotiation or in the agreement come 
under the various points made in the P&G vs BTC case? 
Again, an old Business Week report on the case quotes from the P&G complaint 
that it "was bound by a pricing model which (Bankers Trust) did not disclose 
to the very party that it asserted was bound by such model...". An exact 
parallel to the MSEB/DPC dispute? 
A couple of other points occur to me. The Godbole Committee Report thanks 
IDFC for the excellent work done as the Committee's secretariat. Having put 
in a considerable degree of analytical input, as is evident from the report, 
perhaps the analysts may like to try out one other exercise. This is the 
projection of DPC's balance sheet at the end of the power purchase agreement, 
on the following assumptions: 
l No dividend payment and current tax rates; 
l Dollar appreciation against the rupee of 6 per cent per annum, which is the 
actual rate of the last five years. 
l Interest on rupee surplus funds at 11 per cent per cent, and domestic 
inflation, say, 8 per cent 
per annum 
The exercise would give a final value of DPC's net worth and readily permit 
the calculation of the internal rate of return on the capital invested. How 
does that compare with the returns in dollar terms assured by government 
policy? If the return turns out to be absurdly high, as it well might, this 
could be another example of "superior knowledge" available to the investor 
but not made known to MSEB. 
This apart, in its own affidavit in one of the court cases, MSEB has argued 
why the competitive bidding process was not followed: 
"The competitive bid requires expert knowledge and experience for evaluating 
the competitive bids, which at present is still not sufficiently up to the 
mark. For evaluation of such specialised projects, it is also necessary to 
have knowledge of risk identification and allocation, which is not 
sufficiently developed." 
As if this "expert knowledge" is not needed in bilateral negotiations!

California energy czar vows to get L.A.'s excess power
By DANNY POLLOCK
Associated Press Writer

06/02/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

LOS ANGELES (AP) - California's top energy adviser vowed Saturday that the 
state will get a guarantee from its biggest municipal supplier to provide 
power through the summer. 
"We will get (a contract) in the next few days, one way or another" from the 
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, S. David Freeman told an energy 
summit in Studio City.
"We want a contract for all its surplus over the summer," he said. 
Freeman, former head of the DWP, did not provide details. But his remark 
follows recent warnings by Gov. Gray Davis that he was prepared to use 
executive authority, if necessary, to obtain power from municipal utilities 
and other providers at lower rates. 
The governor has accused city utilities of gouging the state. 
Freeman said the DWP, the state's largest municipal utility, has made $300 
million in profits by selling its excess power to the state's energy grid. 
During a panel discussion, DWP Assistant General Manager Henry Martinez said 
the agency is continuing contract negotiations with the state. 
"We're willing to negotiate ... to make excess power available, but we have 
to make sure the city is taken care of first," Martinez said. 
Los Angeles wants to ensure it won't face blackouts or big rate increases if 
it makes a long-term deal to sell some of its power, he added. 
Californians are facing rolling blackouts this summer, even though Davis has 
expedited the building of more than a dozen new power plants. 
Freeman said new plants would ease the energy crunch, and California should 
be able to meet its demand by next year. The state could begin producing 
surplus power within two years, he added. 
"By 2003, we will have the problem behind us," Freeman said. "We are not 
fighting the war on drugs. We are breaking the back of the problem one power 
plant, one efficient refrigerator and one wind plant at a time." 
There were no power alerts Saturday as electricity reserves stayed above 7 
percent due to lower temperatures and more power plants back on line. 
A nuclear reactor at the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station that was shut 
down in the wake of a February fire was restarted on Friday. The reactor was 
expected to be running at full capacity by Sunday, cranking out enough power 
for 840,000 homes. 
Freeman, in his keynote speech to the summit, praised Californians for 
conserving energy, noting that they used 9 percent less electricity in May 
than they did during the same month last year. 
"Our huge weapon is the market power of the people of California cutting 
back," Freeman said. 
He also took aim at President Bush's energy plan, which calls for oil 
drilling in Alaska but offers little in the way of short-term help for 
California. 
"We do not need to drill in the Arctic or slash and burn what's left of 
America the beautiful," Freeman told the 300 people attending the summit, 
which was sponsored by Los Angeles radio station KFWB-AM. 
The summit also featured Stephen Frank, chairman and CEO of Southern 
California Edison, and John Stout, senior vice president of Reliant Energy. 
Reliant, a Houston-based power generator, outraged state government officials 
last month when it charged California $1,900 per megawatt hour of 
electricity. 
Another generator, Duke Energy Co. of North Carolina, confirmed Friday that 
it sold electricity in California for as much as $3,880 per megawatt hour. 
During the panel discussion, Stout blamed high costs on a reduction of as 
much as 25 percent in hydroelectric power from the Pacific Northwest because 
of a drought, and a seven-fold rise in the past year for natural gas, which 
fuels generating plants. 
Meanwhile, the San Francisco Chronicle reported Saturday that energy-related 
companies, unions, trade groups and executives gave about $95,000 in 
contributions to Freeman's unsuccessful primary campaign for a state Assembly 
seat last year. 
The contributions included $25,000 from Roger W. Sant, chairman of AES. The 
governor recently requested federal regulators ban AES from selling wholesale 
power in California, alleging the company illegally manipulated the market. 
Freeman also got $9,000 from Texas Energy, $8,000 from Edison International, 
parent of Southern California Edison, and $7,500 from Kenneth Lay, CEO of 
Texas-based energy producer Enron. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. contributed 
$5,500. 
Freeman could not immediately be reached for comment after leaving the energy 
summit, but a spokesman for Davis defended the governor's appointee. 
"That was then, and this is now," Steve Maviglio told the Chronicle. "If you 
look at David's statements and actions since he's been on board, he's been 
harshly critical of those who gave him contributions."

SAUDI ARABIA: U.S. Marathon to replace Enron in Saudi gas deal.

06/02/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

JEDDAH, June 2 (Reuters) - U.S. Marathon is set to replace Enron Corp in a 
just-formed consortium to develop a $5 billion gas project in Saudi Arabia, 
industry sources said on Saturday. 
"This is part of Enron's global restructuring," an industry source told 
Reuters.
Saudi Arabia on May 18 awarded U.S. Enron, Occidental and ExxonMobil with 
stakes in the Red Sea gas package - one of three projects on offer under the 
kingdom's $25 billion gas development opening. 
ExxonMobil will retain the lead role, with 60 percent, while Marathon and 
Occidental will each hold 20 percent stakes, the industry sources said. 
Enron Corp last month bowed out of Dolphin Energy Ltd, majority owned by the 
government of the United Arab Emirates, which is embarking on a $3.5 billion 
project to route Qatari gas to the UAE. 
An Enron official has said that the U.S. firm had sold its stake in the 
project to UAE's Offsets Group (UOG) for an undisclosed sum. 
The kingdom has awarded eight major oil companies with stakes in three 
so-called core venture projects - marking a reopening of Saudi Arabia's 
upstream petroleum industry 25 years after nationalisation.

Enron chief worried power plant may be in jeopardy

TORONTO - A planned $200-million power plant for Southwestern Ontario may be 
in jeopardy if the provincial government continues to drag its feet on 
deregulating the province's electricity market, the head of Enron Corp.'s 
Canadian unit said yesterday. 
Enron, the Texas-based energy firm, is slated to build the 400-megawatt Moore 
project near Sarnia, Ont. However, construction of the plant is contingent on 
the government's date for opening the market to competition and time may be 
running out, Rob Milnthorp, president of Enron Canada, said from Calgary.
"I think we are really looking for a fall date as an optimum time for us to 
align our interests with Ontario," Mr. Milnthorp said. 
"If it's put off until spring, I do believe that the project is somewhat in 
jeopardy and would need to be assessed from an operational standpoint against 
all other opportunities that Enron has on its plate." 
Ontario said in April that deregulation would be brought into effect by the 
late spring of 2002, but was accused of raising market uncertainty by not 
setting a specific target date. 
The government may have a better idea of its timetable in September, after a 
key study by the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO) and the 
Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is finalized. The two have set up a joint task 
force to prepare for an opening in the wholesale and retail electricity 
market. 
Mr. Milnthorp said Enron still holds out hope the province will give a target 
date soon after the September study is released. 
Although he said Enron is "still committed to Ontario," he said the company 
will not invest any further until there is greater certainty. 
"We're on hold at this point," he said.

The Weekend
Enron: prime time soap opera
Tamal Bandyopadhyay & S Ravindran

06/02/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

It has been an eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation. But are both sides beginning 
to blink as they stare deep into each others eyes? Until three days ago, it 
looked pretty certain that the US utility giant Enron would pull out of the 
$3 billion 2,184 mw Dabhol power project. But suddenly there are a few 
tell-tale signs that suggest that both sides are looking for a way out of the 
imbroglio. 
Enron made the first move. After weeks of insisting that its agreement was 
sacrosanct, Cline announced that DPC might be willing to cut tariffs and pare 
their rate of returns. And that was even before any negotiations had even 
begun.
The second move came from the institutions which are desperate to prevent the 
project from falling through. The lenders indicated that they would also be 
willing to cut interest rates (which will help bring down the cost of 
tariffs, albeit marginally) and increase the moratorium on loan repayments. 
What's more, they would also stretch the maturity period of loans from nine 
years to 12 years and even convert the foreign exchange loan into rupee loans 
at a later stage. 
There has also been action behind-the-scenes in New Delhi where the Central 
Government has suddenly decided that it must resolve the crisis. For months 
the government had avoided action and insisted that the problem should be 
solved at the state level. Now, Union Energy Minister Suresh Prabhu is 
swinging into action and holding one meeting after another. So is the shadow 
boxing about to end? Or, are they feints that disguise the real intentions of 
the participants? 
The truth is that even the lenders don't seem very sure. And DPC and the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board aren't giving any straight answers. Some 
cynics say that none of the parties have a game plan and they are just being 
borne along by the tide of events. 
Certainly, there has never been another project like it. The Dabhol power 
project _ touted as the showpiece of India's liberalisation programme _ 
easily beats any soap opera for the sheer level of controversy that it has 
generated. 
Consider the twists and turns that have taken place during the last few 
weeks. Only recently, three members of the Madhav Godbole panel set up to 
renegotiate the project, abruptly resigned. The three included former power 
secretary at the Centre E A S Sarma, Tata Energy Research Institute chairman 
R K Pachouri and Kirit Parikh, former director of the Indira Gandhi Institute 
of Developmental Research (IGIDR). 
That was a pretty inauspicious start for the panel. But on May 23,Godbole 
himself resigned because he was peeved at remarks made by the former 
Maharashtra chief minister, Sharad Pawar. A few hours later, Godbole did an 
about turn and withdrew his resignation. Barely a week later, the Maharashtra 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) restrained DPC from proceeding with 
the arbitration process till June 14. 
Godbole and MERC are only peripheral players in the entire drama even though 
they wield enormous clout and can influence the future course of events. The 
two main protagonists Enron (which holds 65 per cent ) and MSEB ( 15 per 
cent) in DPC have been trading charges every day. Until this week, it seemed 
there was little chance of the the two sides patching up the row. 
Will Enron finally exit from DPC? Is MSEB hell-bent on throwing out the US 
energy major _ which controls 51 power plants and other energy projects in 15 
countries spread over four continents into the Arabian Sea? Is the war of 
words only a ploy to get a psychological advantage? 
Caught in the cross-fire, the Indian lenders are too eager to play the role 
of a facilitator. And the fact is that they don't have any choice. At stake 
is over Rs 6,000 crore. If the project sinks, it will knock the bottoms out 
of the three Indian financial intermediaries Industrial Development Bank of 
India, State Bank of India and ICICI. 
Theoretically, they have nothing to worry as all the shares of the company 
are pledged with them and the assets are mortgaged. But there is a sense of 
urgency. The overseas export agencies US-Exim, J-Exim, Miti and OND can 
invoke the accelerable guarantee given by the Indian lenders which will force 
IDBI, SBI and ICICI cough up over Rs 2,000 crore. 
Unlike foreign banks, the Indian financial intermediaries are not covered by 
the Centre's counter-guarantee for phase one. They can only fall back on MSEB 
which is not exactly in the best of health. "We want the project to be 
completed first. If that calls for some sacrifice on our part, we are ready 
to do that. The period of uncertainty must come to an end. We don't know how 
serious is Enron about pulling out of the project. Or, for that matter, what 
is the stance of MSEB," says a senior executive of a financial intermediary. 
What's wrong with the project? Ask MSEB this question. Pat comes the reply: 
an exorbitantly high tariff. The DPC retort is that power offtake is low and 
this has exacerbated the situation. The MSEB is not in a position to lift the 
power and it is not in a position to pay for the power. 
An Enron sympathiser cites an analogy, "MSEB cannot lift the power and hence 
it has to pay a higher price. It's like a situation where you hire a taxi for 
an entire day but you don't go out sight seeing. The taxi driver will still 
charge you even though you are not going out for a ride." Counters an MSEB 
official, "If the driver charges for the taxi that's fine. But in this case, 
Enron factors in the cost of flying a helicopter while fixing the daily rate 
for the taxi. No one can accept that." 
This might be a very simplistic way of looking at the entire controversy. But 
the consensus across all camps is that the weak link in the project is the 
offtake of power. Once that is settled, all the other issues will fall in 
place. Tariffs can always be negotiated. In fact, DPC has already hinted to 
the lenders that it is willing to cut tariffs by 10 per cent. 
That would make a huge difference to the project and everyone knows it. 
Consider this fact. The cost per unit which is currently pegged at Rs 4.50 at 
90 per cent plant load factor (PLF) will come down to Rs 3.50 when the fuel 
base shifts from naphtha to liquefied natural gas (LNG). A 10 per cent cut on 
top of it translates into Rs 3.35 per unit. This is competitive by Indian 
standards. But the $3 billion question is who will lift the power? 
A tailor-made solution could have been to allow the National Thermal Power 
Corporation (NTPC) to lift power from DPC. The Centre has rejected that 
outright but the latest directive issued by the power ministry to the Central 
Electricity Authority for discussions with states that are short of power may 
show a ray of light at the end of the tunnel for DPC. The DPC tariff at this 
point hinges on a host of factors including import duty on fuel, cost of 
fuel, PLF and the rupee/dollar exchange rate. The first phase of the 740 mw 
of the project which is operational uses naphtha, a crude oil derivative, as 
fuel. Every time the price of crude goes up, naphtha prices too increase. For 
instance, when the plant was commissioned in May 1999, crude prices were 
pegged at $15 per barrel. By September 2000, it had gone up to $33 per 
barrel. According to the DPC fact sheet, this pushed up its per unit energy 
cost from Rs 1.44 to Rs 3.18. 
Now consider the PLF. As per the agreement with DPC, MSEB had assured an 
offtake of 90 per cent of the total power capacity at an optimum rate of Rs 
1.88 per unit. But in the 17-month period till October 2000, MSEB was only 
able to life 60 per cent. 
This, along with the depreciation of the rupee and increase in crude prices, 
saw tariff jump to Rs 4.94 per unit on an average. In that period, the power 
tariff per unit touched a high of Rs 7.80 in July 2000 when MSEB was only 
drawing 33 per cent of Dabhol's PLF. Tariffs touched a low of Rs 2.98 in 
August, 1999 when it lifted 60 per cent. 
The Godbole panel's terms of reference include reduction in power tariff and 
delinking the setting up of a five million tonne LNG facility from the power 
project as the project requires only 2.1 million tonne as fuel. At the 
initial stages, DPC cried foul over the terms of reference but later changed 
tack and attended two meetings last month. The second Godole panel meeting on 
May 29 was also attended by the Centre's nominee AV Gokak. 
But if there are a few positive signs there are also a score of other 
negative ones. DPC has packed its senior executives off Singapore. It is 
scouting for buyers for its corporate office at Wockhardt House in 
Bandra-Kurla Complex, a Mumbai suburb. DPC is believed to have sacked 
executives of Metropolitan Gas, an Enron promoted company that was supposed 
to set up the five-million tonne LNG project. Confusion and suspense still 
envelop the fate of the power project. 
The Enron soap opera began in the early nineties when the Congress (I) led 
Sharad Pawar government in Maharashtra signed an agreement for setting up a 
2000mw project. The opposition BJP-Shiv Sena cried foul and alleged kickbacks 
in the deal. After coming to power, the BJP-Sena combine scrapped the project 
almost immediately. But it changed tack soon and set up a committee to review 
the project. 
Enron also initiated arbitration proceedings in London. Based on the 
recommendations of the committee, the Sena -BJP alliance entered into a fresh 
contract with DPC. The project was split into two a 740 mw first phase and 
the 1,444 mw second phase. The first phase was to be naphtha fired, switching 
over to LNG in the second phase. In late 1999, a change of guard in 
Maharashtra saw the Congress-National Congress Party alliance come to power. 
This also brought back Enron to centre-stage. 
Act two of the Enron drama began in November 2000. On the eve of the winter 
legislature session at Nagpur, Maharashtra chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh 
threw a bombshell and declared that the state wouldn't be able to buy power 
from DPC's 1,444 mw second phase. "MSEB would go bankrupt," he said. Under 
the terms of the PPA, the commissioning of phase II would entail MSEB paying 
a minimum of Rs 500 crore per month to DPC as fixed charges alone. MSEB's 
average revenue per month stood at Rs 800 crore. 
Deshmukh's stand was corroborated by Godbole who said that even if 
transmission and distribution losses are reduced drastically, and realisation 
from the subsidised agricultural consumers doubles, the MSEB will not be in a 
position to buy this power. 
Does that mean that MSEB will try to scuttle the project any which way? It 
has already defaulted on payment of power bills, slapped a penalty on DPC for 
delay in power generation and made some payments under protests. Will DPC 
actually mothball the project as has been indicated by Cline to the lenders? 
The Cassandras have started writing the epitaph for the project situated in 
the lush green Ratnagiri district in the Konkan belt. The coming fortnight 
will be crucial. 
First, the lenders are planning to force the promoters (read DPC) to lay all 
its cards on the table at their Singapore meeting on June 5-6. They want to 
know where they stand and are unlikely to allow DPC to continue with its 
ambiguous stance of slapping DPC on May 19 with a preliminary termination 
notice (PTN). 
Enron is also singing two tunes. It has threatened to put the project in cold 
storage on one hand and indicated that it is willing to cut tariffs on the 
other. MERC's stay on the DPC arbitration proceedings will also come to an 
end on June 14. The only thing that is certain about DPC is that the 
uncertainty will continue for a while. The prime time soap opera may get at 
least a 26-episode extension.

White House staff's investments detailed / Holdings include energy stocks, 
Enron

WASHINGTON - Members of the White House staff held sizable amounts of stock 
in energy companies, including at least $100,000 worth of shares in Enron 
Corp., a Houston-based energy marketing company owned by presidential adviser 
Karl Rove, the Bush administration said Friday. 
Based on the advice of the Office of Government Ethics, the staff members are 
preparing to sell their investments, have already done so or have recused 
themselves from policy discussions involving companies they have invested in, 
said a spokesman for the White House.
Financial disclosure forms released by the administration show that several 
of the officials had significant income and assets. 
Among them is National security adviser Condoleezza Rice, the president's 
national security adviser, who held at least $250,000 in Chevron Corp. stock 
and had income last year of more than $555,000. 
Lawrence Lindsey, Bush's chief economic adviser, last year had a salary of 
about $920,000 as managing director of the New York firm Economic Strategies. 
The documents provided the first look at the finances of the senior staff 
working closely with President Bush as the administration continues to set 
course. 
The spokesman for an organization that studies the role of money in politics, 
Steven Weiss of the Center for Responsive Politics, said that although the 
White House staff members appear to be meeting legal requirements, their 
investments in the energy industry "help explain the very close relationship 
the Bush administration has with energy companies overall." 
Rove said he plans to sell his shares, as well as his wife's holdings, but 
was told by the Office of Government Ethics to take no action until he 
receives the office's certificate of divestiture. 
Others with energy holdings include Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's 
chief of staff, who said he sold Texaco stock valued between $15,001 and 
$50,000, and lesser holdings in Enron, Schlumberger Ltd., Chesapeake Energy 
Corp., and Exxon Mobil Corp. 
Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, listed oil and gas royalty interests 
in Pecos County of between $15,000 and $50,000.

Enron backs out of Saudi Arabian natural gas plan

(Copyright 2001)

Enron Corp. has withdrawn from a $25 billion Saudi Arabian natural gas 
venture, leaving its stake in the project to Occidental Petroleum. 
Occidental and six other companies - including Houston-based Conoco - are 
scheduled to sign agreements Sunday to drill for gas and finance and build 
power plants, water desalination plants and other facilities that will use 
the gas.
The venture is divided into three pro-jects that will open the Saudi Arabia's 
natural gas industry to international companies for the first time in two 
decades. 
"If we have a continued association with this project, it will be to provide 
services under a separate contract directly with Occidental," Enron spokesman 
Alex Parsons told Bloomberg. Enron may provide financing or other services to 
Occidental relating to the project later. 
Enron officials would not say why they chose to drop out just two weeks after 
being named to the project. The company has backed off from other large 
infrastructure projects in the recent past, however, and has focused on its 
commodity trading businesses. 
Enron withdrew from a $2 billion pipeline project to export natural gas from 
Qatar last month, while other international projects have proved to be 
difficult. A power-generation project in India has run into trouble because 
of disagreements between Enron and the Indian government over electricity 
prices, and on Friday Enron officials said a $130 million power plant project 
in Ontario may be jeopardy because of the provincial government's 
foot-dragging over electricity deregulation. 
Enron appears to be focusing on its rapidly growing commodity trading 
business, which includes trading natural gas, electricity, broadband Internet 
capacity and even such items as broadcast advertising time. 
While the natural gas project would have been a low-risk operation for Enron, 
and may even have given it an inside track on future projects as the Saudis 
open up their economy to foreign companies, it did not appear to be 
exceptionally profitable. 
Much of Saudi Arabia's gas reserves are well known and relatively easy to tap 
into, but energy analysts have said that the return on investment for the 
project appeared to be less than 15 percent. That is the bare minimum that 
most companies expect for major drilling and infrastructure pro-jects. In 
recent years those margins have more often been above 20 percent. 
If Enron had stayed with the project, it also would have had a minor part in 
the smallest one of the three projects. Enron, Exxon Mobil Corp. and 
Occidental were chosen for the $4 billion Red Sea project, also known as Core 
Venture 2. Exxon was chosen as the lead for the project. 
Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Conoco and Total Fina Elf were picked for the $5 
billion Shaybah natural gas project, also known as Core Venture 3. Conoco 
Chairman Archie Dunham said last month that he would be "very disappointed" 
if Conoco was not named the lead operator for Core Venture 3, but The Wall 
Street Journal reported Friday that Shell appeared to be poised to lead that 
project. 
Exxon, Shell, BP and Phillips Petroleum Co. won the rights to the most 
coveted project, the $15 billion South Ghawar project, or Core Venture 1. 
Exxon is expected to take the lead there. 
Houston-based Marathon Oil Corp. was one of three companies that bid on the 
projects but did not make the final cut.

IRRIGATION SYSTEM HAD ELECTRICAL FIRE

Summary: A man and his dog are electrocuted after touching an irrigation pipe 
An irrigation system that apparently electrocuted a man and his dog Thursday 
evening had been shut down recently by a fire in an electrical line, 
according to the property owner.
William Jay Bowman, 38, was walking along the Molalla River with his dog to 
meet a friend to go fishing when the accident occurred. Apparently both 
Bowman and the dog died after touching an irrigation pipe leading out of the 
Molalla River, Brian Carkner, a Clackamas County Sheriff's deputy, said 
Friday. 
Edward Montecucco, who owns the land near Molalla River State Park where the 
accident occurred, told Carkner that the irrigation system had operated 
without problems since the early 1980s, but that during the Memorial Day 
weekend a fire in the overhead wires had shut down the pumps. 
Portland General Electric sent someone out this week to repair the damage and 
the pumps were turned back on, Montecucco told police. 
Jeff Mayer, a county deputy medical examiner, said an autopsy verified that 
Bowman was electrocuted. 
Bowman's neighbor Jim Newby told Carkner that Bowman left ahead of him on a 
trip Thursday to their usual fishing spot. When Newby arrived, he heard his 
brother-in-law, Michael Riggs, yelling for him to call 9-1-1. 
Another angler, Rick Gatchell, told Carkner he was standing in the river 
downstream from the irrigation pumps when he heard a "bang" from a power pole 
near the pipes and saw the pole shaking. 
Mayer, who was at the farm with PGE representatives on Friday, said he was 
investigating further to try to determine more precisely how Bowman's death 
occurred. 
Mayer said electrocutions involving irrigating system are rare but not 
unheard of. Mayer said he investigated a similar incident last year on a farm 
in Monitor, in which a woman died. 
Mayer said that the deaths should serve as warnings of the danger such 
equipment can pose.

THE NATION Bush Staff Well Invested in Energy Politics: Financial records of 
White House officials show past ties to industry. Several have since divested.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

WASHINGTON -- Members of the White House staff held sizable amounts of stock 
in energy companies, including at least $100,000 worth of shares in Enron 
Corp., the giant energy marketing firm, owned by top presidential advisor 
Karl Rove, the Bush administration said Friday. 
Based on the advice of the Office of Government Ethics, the staff members are 
preparing to sell their investments, have already done so or have recused 
themselves from policy discussions involving companies they have invested in, 
the White House said.
Financial disclosure forms released by the administration show that several 
of the officials had significant income and assets. Among them was 
Condoleezza Rice, the president's national security advisor, who held at 
least $250,000 in Chevron Corp. stock and had an income last year of more 
than $555,000, and Lawrence Lindsey, President Bush's chief economic advisor, 
whose income last year included a salary of about $920,000 as managing 
director of the New York firm Economic Strategies. 
The documents provided the first look at the finances of the senior staff 
working closely with Bush as the new administration sets course. 
The White House said the officials had either sold holdings in specific 
companies or recused themselves from discussions that could have an effect on 
their holdings while in the process of shedding the stocks. 
However, a spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, which studies 
the role of money in politics, said that while the White House staff may be 
meeting legal requirements, the investment in the energy industry "helps 
explain the very close relationship the Bush administration has with energy 
companies overall. 
"I doubt that President Bush is unaware of Karl Rove's position on the issues 
affecting energy companies," spokesman Steven Weiss said. 
Among those filing statements, Lewis Libby, Vice President Dick Cheney's 
chief of staff, said he kept at least $500,000 in checking and savings 
accounts at the Bank of America. 
The statements require senior officials to list assets and income in a broad 
range of figures, from $1,001 to $15,000, for example, or from $250,001 to 
$500,000. Thus, precise amounts cannot be determined. 
While the forms show substantial wealth on the part of some Bush aides, not 
all exceeded $1 million. And significant wealth in the top tier of 
presidential administrations is far from unusual. Similar forms filed by 
President Clinton's staff, for instance, showed a number of top aides were 
millionaires. 
Bush and Cheney filed financial disclosure forms several weeks ago. Bush's 
net worth was at least $9.9 million and Cheney's was at least $10 
million--including at least $1 million in a joint checking account in the 
Northern Trust Bank. 
In addition to stock valued between $100,001 and $250,000 in Enron, Rove, who 
is Bush's chief political strategist, held similar amounts in American 
Express, General Electric Co., Pfizer Inc., Boeing Co., Johnson & Johnson, 
Cisco Systems Inc., Wells Fargo and Intel Corp. 
In an interview, Rove said he had followed the advice of the White House 
counsel's office "on recusing ourselves from anything that would specifically 
or materially affect our financial holdings." 
"I took part in no discussions that would specifically impact my holdings," 
he said, adding that he had avoided such discussions "on several occasions." 
Rove said he plans to sell his shares, as well as his wife's holdings, but 
was told by the ethics office to take no action until he receives the 
office's certificate of divestiture. 
"I have to receive a certificate of divestiture in advance of sale or pay 
capital gains taxes," he said, adding that he has been waiting to receive the 
paperwork. 
He signed his disclosure form on Dec. 30, 2000, three weeks before Bush was 
inaugurated and five days before Bush announced he was appointing Rove to the 
job as his strategist. 
Anne Womack, an assistant White House press secretary, said that some 
officials, although members of Bush's senior staff, were not expected to 
divest themselves of their holdings because their work has no effect on 
policy. Among them are Clay Johnson, Bush's personnel chief, and Albert 
Hawkins, the Cabinet secretary. 
"The White House counsel's office worked with each of the filers to help them 
meet the highest ethical standard," Womack said. "Some have divested 
themselves, some have been advised to recuse themselves from certain issues, 
and in some cases, no changes were necessary because the nature of their work 
will in no way affect their financial situation." 
Rice, for example, said she had sold her Chevron stock and nearly all her 
other stocks. 
Others with energy holdings included Libby, the Cheney aide, who reported 
that he had sold Texaco Inc. stock valued between $15,001 and $50,000 and 
lesser holdings in Enron Corp., Schlumberger Ltd., Chesapeake Energy Corp. 
and Exxon Mobil Corp. 
Karen Hughes, the president's counselor, listed oil and gas royalty interests 
in Pecos County, Texas, worth between $15,000 and $50,000. 
Johnson, whose job involves filling political positions across the 
administration, holds at least $100,000 in El Paso Energy Partners and at 
least $65,000 in oil royalties, and at least $50,000 in separate bonds from 
Texas Muni Power and Duke Power. 
Nicholas Calio, the White House director of legislative affairs--Bush's 
representative to Congress--holds stocks with values of at least $15,000 in 
each of three energy-related companies: Exxon Mobil, General Electric and 
Texaco. 
Andrew H. Card Jr., Bush's chief of staff, was a vice president of General 
Motors Corp., heading its office of global government relations, for which he 
was paid $479,000 last year. His assets ranged from $800,000 to $1.75 
million, including a family home in Holbrook, Mass., and an IRA account, 
mutual funds and municipal bonds. 
Stephen J. Hadley, Bush's deputy national security advisor, had assets 
between $900,000 and $2.1 million; Margaret La Montagne, director of the 
domestic policy council, held between $100,000 and $200,000 in stock.

NEWS
Davis' energy boss took thousands from power titans in run for office
Carla Marinucci
Chronicle Political Writer

06/02/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.1
(Copyright 2001)

Barely more than a year before S. David Freeman was named by Gov. Gray Davis 
to be the state's power czar, he was showered with campaign cash from some of 
the same energy giants the governor has lambasted as profit-hungry "pirates" 
robbing California consumers. 
Freeman received roughly $95,000 in more than 50 contributions from energy 
companies, executives, unions and political action committees as a Democratic 
candidate in the March 2000 primary for a state Assembly seat.
In April 2001, Davis named Freeman -- the former head of the Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power -- his chief energy adviser, charged with 
representing consumer interests and pushing conservation. 
"These guys have us by the throat, and still do," said Freeman earlier this 
week in an interview with The Chronicle. "We're in a war with generators and 
we're going to try and protect ourselves." 
But campaign contribution records show that Freeman's lifelong contacts in 
the energy business served him well as a political candidate in the 41st 
Assembly District contest in the San Fernando Valley. 
In his unsuccessful campaign, Freeman received a $7,500 check from Kenneth 
Lay, who heads the Texas energy giant, Enron -- one of the Texas energy 
"pirates" whom the governor has accused of fleecing California consumers. 
And state records show a $25,000 campaign check from Roger W. Sant, chairman 
of the energy giant AES -- the same firm that Davis recently requested 
federal regulators ban from selling wholesale power in California. The 
governor charged that AES has illegally manipulated the market. 
"For citizens of California, this information should raise eyebrows," said 
Chuck Lewis, who heads the Center for Public Integrity, a campaign finance 
watchdog in Washington, D.C. "I can't call it an auspicious sign." 
Indeed, state documents show a "who's who" of big energy firms contributed 
last year to Freeman's losing Assembly campaign: El Paso Energy, Pacific Gas 
and Electric Co., Calpine, Sempra Energy, Edison International and Sunlaw 
Energy, among others. 
Energy-related political action committees also contributed, including the 
Independent Energy Producers PAC and the Texas Energy Group. 
There were also checks from at least two officials with the Independent 
System Operator, which manages California's power grid, including CEO Terry 
M. Winter and CIO Kellan Fluckinger. 
Freeman couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, but Davis' spokesman 
defended Freeman as a tough consumer advocate and highly respected energy 
expert. 
"That was then, and this is now," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman, of 
the campaign contributions. "If you look at David's statements and actions 
since he's been on board, he's been harshly critical of those who gave him 
contributions." 
Noting that Freeman was on national television yesterday lambasting energy 
firms, Maviglio said, "David is one of the most prominent people in the 
energy business in the U.S. It's natural people in the energy business would 
contribute to his campaign, but I don't think it's affected his rhetoric or 
his actions." 
Freeman, 76, a Tennessee native, served four presidents as an energy adviser, 
dating to the Kennedy administration when he was a member of the Federal 
Power Commission. He was chosen by President Jimmy Carter to lead the 
Tennessee Valley Authority, the largest public power agency in the country. 
CONFLICT QUESTIONS RAISED 
But critics say checks from energy giants to Freeman's Assembly campaign 
raise questions of a conflict of interest -- and underscore troubling issues 
of campaign finances. 
"It certainly brings into question the independence of the people who are 
advising (Davis)," said Steve Weiss, who heads the Washington, D.C., Center 
for Responsive Politics, a watchdog group. "It would be difficult to envision 
a scenario where (a candidate) getting huge amounts of money from an industry 
is going to completely ignore that industry when policies affecting it come 
up." 
Lewis said Freeman's contributions dramatize his reputation as "a 
well-connected fellow." 
"He knows the titans of the industry, and the sitting governor of 
California," Lewis said. "So financially and politically, he's wired. Energy 
companies understand he's a player, and they want to influence him and 
impress him." 
But Freeman's largesse from energy firms is hardly shocking. 
DONORS ARE SAVVY 
"The energy companies are probably as smart about the campaign checks they 
write as they are about business decisions that result in huge profits," 
Weiss said. "Campaign contributions are an investment. They give to (someone) 
they feel can help them out at a later date." 
And they have no partisan loyalty: Lay ranked as one of President Bush's 
biggest contributors, while Enron was the largest energy contributor to GOP 
causes. 
Still, Republicans seized on the revelations, saying they underscore Davis' 
inability to solve the energy crisis. 
"This is one more piece of evidence suggesting the hypocrisy of this whole 
sordid affair," said GOP strategist Mark Bogetich. "You have the governor 
trying to demonize state energy companies" while Los Angeles water and power 
tries to make the same profits. "Then the governor names the head of that 
agency to be his energy czar." 
Freeman had lived just two years in the 41st Assembly District when he 
campaigned last year to represent the area. At the time, he was on leave from 
his job heading the Los Angeles power agency. 
Freeman, in press accounts of the campaign, said the strong support he 
received from big out-of-state companies wasn't relevant. 
STANDING ON RECORD 
"I think what people like about me is my life's work -- 25 years of 
protecting the environment and saving taxpayers money," he said at the time. 
Davis selected Freeman, a lifelong advocate of conservation, in January to 
negotiate long-term electricity contracts when the state began buying power 
on behalf of the cash-strapped utilities. In April, Davis announced Freeman's 
role as the state's top energy adviser.

Bush Aides Disclose Finances; Several Tied to Enron; Speaking Fees Boost 
Matalin Income

The odd couple of American politics, White House aide Mary Matalin and 
Democratic strategist James Carville, racked up $3.4 million in speaking fees 
last year, according to financial disclosure forms released yesterday. 
Matalin, a senior adviser to Vice President Cheney, was required to stop her 
lucrative appearances when she joined the Bush administration in January. She 
appears to be one of the wealthiest White House aides, with investments 
valued at between $3.9 million and $9.7 million. Besides her speaking fees, 
she reported $244,581 in income last year from hosting the CNN television 
show "Crossfire."
Karl Rove, a senior political adviser to President Bush, reported assets 
totaling between $2.3 million and $5.5 million. Cheney's chief of staff, 
lawyer I. Lewis Libby, reported holdings of $2.4 million to $5.4 million. 
The disclosure forms for 18 top White House officials, released by the 
administration in response to requests from news organizations, show that a 
number of senior aides have financial ties to the Texas energy firm Enron, 
either as owners of its stock or as paid consultants to the company. 
Bush economic adviser Lawrence B. Lindsey received $50,000 last year for 
consulting with an Enron advisory board, and Rove owned Enron shares worth up 
to $250,000. Rove's disclosure document noted he planned to sell all stock in 
individual companies, which included holdings of similar size in such firms 
as General Electric and Pfizer. 
Enron was one of the biggest contributors to Bush's campaign, and its 
chairman, Kenneth Lay, has been close to the president and his father for 
many years. Lay has wielded considerable influence in shaping the president's 
recently announced energy plan. 
Lindsey reported an annual salary of $918,785 from his consulting firm, 
Economic Strategies Inc., where he has worked since 1997 advising financial 
companies and large international firms. In addition, he reported a $50,000 
consulting fee from Crow Family Holdings, a real estate investment business 
in Dallas; another of the same size from the Moore Capital hedge fund; and 
$62,228 in salary from the conservative American Enterprise Institute. 
Lindsey reported an investment portfolio of between $586,000 and $1,340,000. 
That sum may have been held down by his decision several years ago to sell 
off his stock market holdings because he was convinced that the economy was 
headed for trouble and, in his own words, "so I can sleep at night." 
Lindsey's remaining portfolio is heavy in bonds -- he owned up to $500,000 in 
a Fidelity bond fund, and up to $100,000 in high-yield corporate "junk" bonds 
-- as well as U.S. Treasury inflation-indexed bonds and some gold mine 
investments. 
Several other Bush aides revealed substantial income during previous jobs in 
the private sector. White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr. reported 
making $479,138 last year as General Motors Corp.'s vice president for 
government relations and chief lobbyist. His deputy, Joseph W. Hagin, made 
$368,660 as vice president for corporate affairs at Chiquita Brands, the 
politically wired banana company. 
Nicholas Calio, Bush's director of legislative affairs, reported making 
$947,671 last year from his lobbying firm, O'Brian Calio. He added that he 
divested his share in the partnership last month and expects to receive a 
lump sum next year. 
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice reported selling her stock 
holdings in Chevron Corp., on whose board she served; they had been worth 
between $250,000 and $500,000. She received director's fees of $60,000 from 
Chevron and made $243,000 as Stanford University's provost. 
Although the White House released the disclosure statements for 18 top aides, 
about 100 senior employees had to submit the forms, revealing their exact 
income but listing their assets and liabilities only in broad ranges. Those 
who own stock in companies with business before the government must recuse 
themselves or sell down their stock to less than $5,000 worth. 
According to the form filed by Matalin, she made $1.35 million for speaking 
appearances last year and Carville made $2.1 million. In many cases, they 
appeared together -- earning fees of $16,000 each, for example, for speeches 
to such companies as Philip Morris, GE Capital, Microsoft, Seagram's, Time 
Inc. and Chase Manhattan. 
Carville may find it difficult to step up his pace to make up for the loss of 
his wife's hefty income. He was on the road constantly last year, making 154 
appearances around the country.

To the Editor: 
Paul Krugman misunderstands Enron, the people who work here and the botched California regulatory system (column, Aug. 17). The broader goal of his latest attack on Enron appears to be to discredit the free-market system, a system that entrusts people to make choices and enjoy the fruits of their labor, skill, intellect and heart. He would apparently rely on a system of monopolies controlled or sponsored by government to make choices for people. We disagree, finding ourselves less trusting of the integrity and good faith of such institutions and their leaders.
The example Mr. Krugman cites of ''financialization'' run amok (the electricity market in California) is the product of exactly his kind of system, with active government intervention at every step. Indeed, the only winners in the California fiasco were the government-owned utilities of Los Angeles, the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. The disaster that squandered the wealth of California was born of regulation by the few, not by markets of the many.

This year's honour roll of former chief executives is impressive and lengthening. Flemming Lindelov of Carlsberg Breweries left for a decorative arts company, while Jeff Skilling resigned from Enron last week for "personal reasons" and the amiable Michael Bonsignore bade farewell to Honeywell. 
While some bosses have been shown the door, there appears to be a separate pattern forming - chief executives leaving prematurely because life at the top is too tough and stressful, raising the question as to whether the modern CEO has the right stuff.
And there is the pressing issue of how activist a board should be in these "transition" issues. Take, for example, Hewlett-Packard directors, several of whom this week swore their allegiance to Carly Fiorina, the chief executive whose fate has been the subject of much speculation. 
In venture-capital-backed companies directors have traditionally been active in recruiting and overseeing financial management, taking credit for success and, sometimes, distancing themselves from blame. But in public companies, which have fuller management teams, directors have tended to take a back seat. 
According to Roger Kenny, managing partner of Boardroom Consultant, a New York firm that recruits directors and senior management, boards have become more responsive to their company's performance - and are willing to act. 
"Institutional investors have been successfully criticising boards for a long time. They have put some fibre in the backbone of the directors," said Kenny. 
Directors are now faced with preventing or mitigating CEO disasters. "In the past, boards may have felt beholden to the CEO and been willing to overlook mistakes, giving him time to right the ship. Today, a sense of urgency often pervades board meetings when performance slips," he added. 
Take the case of Lucent. "If Lucent's board had removed its CEO earlier in the game, would the company be in better shape today?" asks Kenny. Or Xerox. "Should Xerox's board have demanded more information about strategic execution from the new CEO before the strategy foundered?" 
There are no sure answers but the short period that many CEOs remain in the job - on average four years - suggests it is tough to satisfy shareholders and directors, particularly during a downturn. 
"One of the great revelations of the past year has been the capacity of a CEO to destroy value in a very short period of time," said David Nadler, chairman of Mercer Delta Consultants. 
Boards need to act pre-emptively to reduce the risk of a meltdown. The trick lies in the timing. Some say boards should give CEOs more time because the economy can be blamed for failure. Others argue they should give the CEO less time because the economy makes the situation perilous and there is no time to lose. 
"Boards struggle to balance acting swiftly (to prevent Lucent-like situations) and not jumping the gun," said Kenny. "It's a fine line, especially during economic downturns such as the current one." 
Kenny says there are a number of steps a board can take to prevent CEO failure, including becoming involved in CEO succession and doing "whatever it takes" to become familiar with the company's core business strategy. 
And tradition is important. The Hewlett-Packard directors insisted that Fiorina was faithful to the founders' dream - until then, there had been outside speculation that, for Fiorina, it would be the HP way or the highway.

Power station blast still a puzzle

SAFETY inspectors investigating a power station explosion which killed three workers have so far found no evidence of mechanical failure. 
Andy Sherwood, 36, and Darren Higgins, 28, caught the full brunt of the blast in a transformer at Enron's Teesside Power Station at Grangetown, Middlesbrough, on August 8 and could only be identified from dental records.
Colleague Lawrence Surtees, 40, died in hospital the next day after suffering near 100 per cent burns. Graeme White, 37, is being treated in hospital for moderate burns. 
The dead men were carrying out maintenance on the transformer at the time of the explosion. 
Vera Baird, MP for Redcar, has discussed the situation with Ian Waugh, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspector in charge of the team investigation. She said: "I said when this appalling tragedy occurred that I would monitor the investigation on behalf of my constituents and I have been told that the investigation has established that the cause was the explosion of a transformer. 
"I am assured that there is no fundamental hardware problem with the equipment used on the site that would be likely to cause a repetition and this will be reassuring for the people who live and work nearby." 
Less that a week after the funeral services of the men who died, the MP has revealed that all interviews and investigations of equipment are complete and Mr Waugh is waiting for his inspectors to write their reports, which ought to take about four weeks. 
Mr Waugh will then review their findings and his final report will be sent to the Teesside Coroner. 
A copy of the report will also be sent to Cleveland Police who set up a joint investigation with the safety inspectors. 
Mrs Baird's reading of the team's findings so far went unchallenged by Government sources last night, who added that the team reserved the right to return to the plant for a re-examination if something cropped up in the reports which required further investigation. 
A spokesman for Enron said: "Assurances about the safety of Teesside Power Station have been given by the site operator - Enron - to local residents and industrial neighbours over the past few days as the process of restarting the plant was carried out. 
"The company is not be commenting on any possible cause of the incident on August 8 and will not be drawn in at this stage as the investigation by the HSE remains incomplete."

Panel unable to find meeting point with Enron

MUMBAI: The Enron renegotiation committee, which is expected to submit its report soon, has been unable to find a meeting point with the multinational over any of the issues discussed during its meetings. 
According to sources, the meetings with Enron were doomed right from the word go, since Enron disagreed with most of the suggestions made by the committee. This could have to do with the energy major having already decided to exit the plant and not wanting to make any further compromises.
To begin with, the committee wanted to scale down the tariff from over Rs 4 per unit to Rs 2.07 per unit. This was not acceptable to Enron, which was willing to settle for not more than a 10 per cent reduction in tariff. 
Enron representatives told the panel that its landed cost of LNG alone worked out to Rs 2.11 per unit in power tariff. Even the offer made by states outsides Maharashtra to buy Enron power could not meet with a consensus, sources said. 
Among the states which approached the panel to buy Enron power were Delhi, MP, UP, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Karnataka. However, Enron found the purchase rates which ranged from Rs 1.50 to Rs 2.50 impractical. 
The committees demand to remove the dollar denomination in tariff was rejected outright by Enron on the grounds that its international lenders would never agree to accept returns in Indian currency. A debt moratorium for five years, as suggested, was also ruled out. 
Enron was asked to bring down interest rates on its debt component to less than 12 per cent. This was ruled out by the multi-national which claimed it was less than the cost of its borrowings. While the projects Indian lenders agreed last year to cut interest rates from 21.5 per cent to 16 per cent, its international lenders charge nine per cent in dollar terms. 
Enrons return on equity too has hovered around a low of 12 per cent, since the past two years, lower than the interest on its debt. 
With a view to reducing the liability of the cash-strapped Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the renegotiating committee suggested that the Dabhol plant be operated at a lower plant load factor (PLF) of 30 per cent. The PLF is a major bone of contention between the two parties, since the state says it does not need power at a 90 per cent PLF and since tariff is predicated on a PLF of 90 per cent in the power purchase agreement, irrespective of the actual offtake. 
It is learnt that Enron was asked to operate the plant at 30 per cent PLF from 2002 and scale up to 68.5 per cent in 2007 to offset the huge tariff burden on MSEB. This proposal was unpalatable to Enron. 
Another proposal which was turned down by Enron was the suggestion that the returns on its equity be trimmed to 16 per cent in rupee terms at 68.5 per cent PLF. As of now, the DPC gets 16 per cent returns at 68.5 per cent PLF in dollars with a 0.7 per cent incentive for every one per cent increase in the PLF. 
According to sources, the committee discussed abolishing the incentive component, bringing down PLF, and pegging return in Indian currency. With the multi-national mouthing a firm No to most of the proposals, it remains to be seen how the Godbole report will be implemented and whether the state will see yet another round of protracted litigation on the controversial project.

INDIA: ANALYSIS-Poor governance hobbles India's reform drive.
By Alan Wheatley, Asian Economics Correspondent

08/22/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, Aug 22 (Reuters) - After six months of political stalemate, the rave reviews for Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha's reforming budget have given way to the despairing conclusion that perhaps India embraces change only in a crisis. 
In which case, a new wave of reforms might not be far away.
For unless growth picks up substantially from last year's 5.2 percent pace, policy experts said India would face a further deterioration in its public finances and rising unemployment that could put the world's largest democracy under serious strain. 
"We can't go on without further reforms for very long because we won't be able to grow even by five percent," said Shashanka Bhide, chief economist of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. 
"So the crisis is already there. If we're not going to get six percent-plus growth rates, then it's a political problem." 
There is a broad consensus - on paper - on the need for a second wave of reforms to build on ground-breaking liberalisation measures rushed in after a balance-of-payments crisis in 1991. 
Because its economy is fairly closed, India has weathered the current global downturn much better than most of its Asian neighbours, who would be delighted with five percent growth. 
Still, output has slowed for two years in a row as post-reform momentum has petered out. And crucially, five percent growth falls far short of the 8.7 percent average needed over the next decade to achieve Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's goal of doubling per capita income, currently around $460 a year. 
"Eight million people come into the workforce every year and a five percent growth rate would leave large numbers of people unemployed, which means there will be greater social unrest," said P Chidambaram, a former finance minister. 
"A five percent growth rate, while statistically acceptable, is simply politically unacceptable and socially unacceptable." 
COMPETITIVE POLITICS 
It was to raise the economy's speed limit that Sinha unveiled in his February budget a raft of far-reaching structural reforms making it easier to fire workers and rolling back the policy of reserving certain industries for small and medium-sized firms. 
The reforms are high on the list of the many blueprints for change in India but they soon became mired in what the Planning Commission aptly calls the "compulsion of competitive politics". 
On a charitable view, the slow progress is a reflection of the wondrous kaleidoscope that is India's multi-party democracy. 
"This is not a country, this is a vast continent in search of a synthesis in the political domain, the social domain and the economic domain," said Amit Mitra, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. 
Less charitably, the legislative paralysis is due to the failure by an enfeebled Vajpayee to crack heads in his unwieldy 19-party coalition and force ministers to put the national interest before the myriad vested interests opposed to change. 
Arjun Sengupta, a professor at the Centre for Policy Research, said the absence of a unified agenda meant each member of the coalition was ploughing its own furrow, resulting in policy inconsistency that was deterring badly needed investment. 
"This is the main problem we have today: we do not have a coherent, unified policy framework," Sengupta said. 
He said the reform task facing the government was all the more difficult because India's most populous and backward states were falling farther and farther behind the better-off ones. 
"If the Centre cannot take care of the problems of disparity between the states, we are facing major problems which can become explosive," Sengupta, a former ambassador and IMF official, said. 
Peering through the gloom, optimists point to the precedent of legislation passed without the pressure of a crisis in 1999 to open up India's insurance market to foreign firms. 
They hope two equally controversial reform bills, to liberalise the crisis-ridden power sector and to make it easier to wind up bankrupt firms, will also eventually become law after they won cabinet approval last week, ending months of wrangling. 
"Anybody who says reforms have been a failure in this country hasn't looked at figures on poverty very closely," said Planning Commission member N.K. Singh. He said the poverty rate had fallen in the past decade to 27 percent from 37 percent. 
REFORM PRIORITIES 
The list of reforms needed to sustain this improvement is lengthy. Because of its pivotal role in the economy, the power sector is many experts' number one priority. The well-catalogued troubles that foreign firms such as Enron Corp have encountered dealing with India's all-but-bankrupt state power boards have flashed warning signals to potential foreign investors. 
Domestic investors have also been deterred because industrial users pay twice as much as they would in China for electricity. 
Nevertheless, attempts at serious reform have foundered on twin political rocks: how to end overmanning at the power boards, estimated at 50-70 percent, and how to charge users, mainly farmers, market rates for stolen or heavily subsidised power. 
D.K. Srivastava, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, said politicians might consider tough measures if they could be assured that benefits would be visible before they have to seek re-election two or three years later. 
"Any government under any minister will say to you, How can I survive unless I can show my voters jobs?'," Srivastava said. "This is one of the basic constraints on power sector reform." 
T.K. Bhaumik, a senior adviser at the Confederation of Indian Industry, agreed and said reformers were partly to blame for having failed to sell the case for change to India's mass poor. 
"We did not articulate the economic reform process to the people," Bhaumik said. On privatisation, for instance, policy-makers did not spell out the consequences for jobs. 
"I don't think we really understood the issues properly. We simply followed the Washington consensus and that didn't go down well with the people," he said. 
As Divestment Minister Arun Shourie knows only too well. The privatisation programme he oversees, a litmus test of India's reform will, is stalled because of what Shourie calls "fractured" politics and "noise" generated by corporate interests. 
Shourie said he could only hope that fading growth would jolt India's politicians into putting the country's interests first. 
"We're on the cusp at the moment on the question of reforms and I feel the real circumstances in which India is placed will force the political class to do the right thing," he said.

Calif Senate Panel To Study Muni Utils Pwr Mkt Activities

08/21/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A California Senate committee investigating electricity market manipulation in the state will continue its activities past the legislature's Sept. 14 adjournment date, and will look into prices charged by municipal utilities as well as by private generators, said committee Chairman Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, Tuesday. 
"We had to prioritize who we would investigate first. We started with generators, then expanded to traders and we're also going to look at the state's utilities. We've already made document requests of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and the Sacramento Municipal Utility District," Dunn said.
Dunn said the LADWP hasn't provided all documents to the committee, though they have indicated they are happy to cooperate. 
"It's taken LADWP a while. It doesn't seem to be the case that they are withholding those documents, though we don't have them all," Dunn said. 
No one at LADWP was available to comment on the matter. 
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has cited Enron Corp. (ENE) and Reliant Energy (REI) with contempt for refusing to provide certain documents. If the full Senate approves those contempt charges, the companies could be punished, most likely with fines. 
A study by trade group Independent Energy Producers Association found that Reliant and Enron Power Marketing Inc. charged the state's power-buying arm less than the average price of $269 a megawatt-hour for electricity in January through March. The LADWP and SMUD charged more than the average. 
The committee's next hearing will be in the first week of September, Dunn said. Hearings throughout the fall will concentrate on depositions, he added.

Fired Calif DWR Traders Had Access To ISO's Control Room
By Bryan Lee

08/21/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Four of the five California Department of Water Resources power traders fired last month for conflict of interest reasons had access to the state electricity grid operator's control room.
That revelation was contained in a recent letter to the House Government Reform Committee from Terry Winter, the California Independent System Operator's president and chief executive. 
The letter responded to House lawmakers' concerns, voiced during an Aug. 2 hearing, about DWR power traders having access to the ISO's control room floor and the wealth of market-sensitive information available there. 
Rep. Doug Ose, R-Calif., who chairs the committee's energy policy panel, said access to the ISO's control room allowed DWR traders to "cherrypick" power purchases, and led federal regulators to exclude DWR purchases from consideration in a recent landmark refund order. 
The five fired DWR traders owned stock in Calpine Corp. (CPN), a major power provider in California. 
The four fired DWR employees with access to the ISO control room were William Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Chung. The fifth, Richard Ferreiro, wasn't among those Winter listed as having control-room access. Neither did Elaine Griffin, who resigned after it was learned she owned Calpine stock. 
They were among 14 DWR employees who had their control-room access privileges terminated by the ISO over the past two months. The others had their badges deactivated because they either hadn't filed necessary confidentiality statements or hadn't been using their badges to access the ISO control room, said Stephanie McCorkle, an ISO spokeswoman. 
Nine DWR power traders still enjoy access to the ISO control room, according to Winter's letter to Ose. Among them is Bernard Barretto, who reportedly owns stock in Enron Corp. (ENE). 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for California Gov. Gray Davis who recently sold Calpine stock after conflict-of-interest concerns were raised, said earlier this month that Barretto's investment met state ethics rules because Enron wasn't making sales in the spot market, where the DWR employee was involved in making power purchases. 
DWR employees' investments are "thoroughly reviewed" to make sure there are no conflicts, DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said. Employees must either divest their stock or recuse themselves from deals that involve their financial interests, Hidalgo said. 
An Ose spokesman, Yier Shi, said the congressman believes the arrangement has worked against the interests of California consumers. 
"It's pretty obvious that it isn't in the interest of California consumers, the DWR or the ISO to have that conflict of interest in the power-purchasing process," Shi said. 
"Why is DWR getting preferential access? That's the core issue," Shi added. 
Allowing DWR power traders into the ISO control room is "a real conflict because DWR is the major buyer in the state," said Lynne Church, president of the Electric Power Supply Association, whose members include many of the companies that own power plants in California. 
"Having access to the control room gives them intelligence on what sellers into shorter-term markets are charging, (including) what's being sold and to whom," Church said. 
"Any kind of buyer or seller would give their eye teeth for that kind of access," she said, noting that no other grid operator in the country allows that sort of access. "It's just unconscionable for them to have that kind of access to market intelligence." 
During the Aug. 2 hearing that Ose chaired, Winter agreed that having DWR employees in the control room was a problem. The ISO is "working very hard to get them out," he said. 
The access was provided back in January, after the DWR was forced to begin purchasing what since then has amounted to about $10 billion in power on behalf of the state's bankrupt and near-bankrupt investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. (PCG) and Southern California Edison Co. (EIX). 
Power providers were balking at continuing to sell power to California unless they were assured of creditworthy buyers. And the DWR refused to take on the responsibility unless the ISO granted the agency access to the control room, Winter told Ose's subcommittee. 
The arrangement was necessary to avert imminent blackouts, he said. 
The DWR will withdraw its employees from the ISO control room effective Sept. 1, Pete Garris, who oversees power purchases for the DWR, announced over the weekend. 
"It wasn't our intent to be there on a permanent basis," said Hidalgo, the DWR spokesman, who described the privilege as "a temporary move to keep the lights on." 
Now that the state's electricity crisis has lessened, the DWR's "goal" is to have the traders out of the ISO control room by Sept. 1, Hidalgo said. 
"We're pleased to see that the DWR is working toward resolving its conflict of interest problems with the ISO," said Shi, the Ose aide. "We hope this change of policy isn't too little too late for California consumers to win refunds."

For Crucial California Trip, Bush Calibrates How Best to Handle State's 
Energy Crisis
By DAVID E. SANGER

05/29/2001
The New York Times
Page 12, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

LOS ANGELES, May 28 -- Days after he suffered the biggest political setback 
of his four-month-old presidency and then won the tax cut that he staked his 
campaign upon, President Bush traveled tonight to California, carefully 
calibrating how to deal with the state's energy crisis. 
After Memorial Day celebrations in Washington and Mesa, Ariz., Mr. Bush began 
his first visit as president to the most populous state, which he lost by 
roughly 12 percentage points in November's election. The visit seems likely 
to showcase the clash between two very different energy strategies and 
political strategies.
Mr. Bush will meet briefly on Tuesday with Gov. Gray Davis, who will insist, 
as he did again today, that the federal government impose price caps on 
wholesale electric power. 
The White House says Mr. Bush will refuse, again. He will argue that such 
caps would only discourage increased production of electric power. ''We think 
that's a mistake,'' Vice President Dick Cheney said on Friday, talking about 
why he rejected those options when he prepared the energy policy the 
administration made public 10 days ago. 
But Mr. Bush knows that how he handles the California energy crisis could 
prove critical to his political fortunes, especially now that his party's 
loss of control in the Senate seems bound to slow or derail passage of major 
elements of his energy plan. 
Moreover, the president can no longer argue that the best cure for high 
energy prices is a tax cut, because that is now legislative history. As one 
of his aides said this weekend, after Congress approved the $1.35 trillion 
tax cut that will be phased in over the next 10 years, ''we will have to turn 
now to the other arguments.'' 
Most of those arguments involve urging the rest of the country not to follow 
California in a partial deregulation of the market, with disastrous results. 
Repeatedly Mr. Bush has chastised California's politicians, and by 
implication Mr. Davis himself, for ignoring politically unpalatable choices 
to avert the state's power-generating crisis. Ten days ago, standing in front 
of a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, Mr. Bush used the state as Exhibit 
A for his argument about what happens when population rises, when 
over-regulation freezes the construction of new power plants and the 
stringing of new transmission lines, and when politicians fail to plan for 
the long term. 
''The problems in California shows that you cannot conserve your way to 
energy independence,'' Mr. Bush said then. 
At the same time, his aides were pointing to polls showing Mr. Davis's 
approval ratings plunging. They did not mention that Mr. Bush's ratings in 
the state were hardly any better. A series of recent polls show that roughly 
two-thirds of Californians believe Mr. Bush should be doing far more to help 
the state, though it is unclear exactly what kind of help they have in mind. 
So Mr. Bush's aides have been struggling for days to choreograph the two-day 
visit here, trying to find ways to differ with Mr. Davis without seeming 
callous about the problem or in conflict with the state. 
The betting is that Mr. Bush will focus on long-term solutions, in contrast 
to Mr. Davis's call for the quicker fix of price caps. 
The effort started today. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham issued an order of 
chiefly symbolic importance, saying his department would move quickly to 
determine whether investors were interested in financing and co-owning a new 
transmission line that could bring more power to the state. 
''The level of interest will be a factor in the decision to build the line 
later this year,'' the Energy Department said. It said that it would proceed 
with studies of how the land could be acquired, by eminent domain if 
necessary, and that it would speed ahead with environmental reviews. 
But Mr. Abraham left wide open the question of whether Washington would go 
ahead with the project even if no private financing was available. 
''The Bush administration is taking a leadership role in addressing a 
long-neglected problem in California's electricity transmission system,'' Mr. 
Abraham said. ''California's electricity problems developed over a period of 
years and cannot be solved overnight. However, we can move now on actions 
that will help avert the same types of problems from recurring year after 
year.'' 
The statement was clearly intended as a prelude to the meeting with Mr. 
Davis, which will be closed to the press. So will a meeting with energy 
entrepreneurs. (Mr. Bush passed on Mr. Davis's suggestion of a forum with 
small-business owners and residents who have seen the lights go out.) 
Few expect Mr. Bush or Mr. Davis to change his mind about energy caps after 
their meeting. 
But for Mr. Bush it will not all be tough love. On Tuesday morning Mr. Bush 
is scheduled to travel to Camp Pendleton to repeat his call for the military 
and other federal users of power in California to flip off their switches 
whenever possible. But given his own comments, and Mr. Cheney's, about the 
limited utility of conservation, that order could strike some Californians as 
a little hollow. 
Later he will give a trade speech in Los Angeles, underscoring the message 
that if California hopes to remain the world's greatest exporter of high 
technology -- if it were a nation, California would be the world's 
sixth-largest economy -- it must find new ways to produce and deliver 
electricity. 
Already, leading Silicon Valley companies are threatening to build their 
next-generation chip fabrication plants elsewhere, probably in Texas, which 
has a surplus of generating capacity, a move that would further undermine Mr. 
Davis's stewardship. 
In fact, Mr. Bush's Texas roots will never be far from the political 
battlefield here. Mr. Davis has accused Texas energy companies of 
profiteering at California's expense. To press the case, he has hired two 
political operatives from the Clinton White House, Marc D. Fabiani and Chris 
Lehane, who are being paid tens of thousands of dollars a month to make the 
case for price caps. 
California's attorney general, Bill Lockyer, also a Democrat, suggested to 
The Wall Street Journal last week that some time in jail would be the best 
way to deal with one of Mr. Bush's biggest supporters -- Kenneth Lay, who 
heads the Enron Corporation and has sought to influence the selection of 
members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
The comments may have been partly facetious, but they were not interpreted 
that way here.

In Billing Spat, Enron Project Rejects Payment By Indian State
By Jesse Pesta
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

05/29/2001
The Wall Street Journal
A14
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -- In an unusual twist in their quarrel over unpaid bills, Enron 
Corp.'s Indian power project, Dabhol Power Corp., has rejected a check valued 
at $29.1 million from its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, to make a legal point. 
Dabhol also delivered a sharply worded four-page letter to the MSEB, 
responding to the electricity board's decision last week to rescind its 
power-purchasing contract based on a claim that Dabhol misrepresented its 
"ramp-up" speed -- the time the plant takes to go from a cold start to full 
power. "We deny that DPC have practiced any misrepresentation," Dabhol's 
letter says. "Furthermore, we do not think that the MSEB entertains any 
honest belief" in its own allegation, it says.
It's the latest in a series of rancorous exchanges as both sides try to gain 
an edge in a fight over Dabhol's power tariffs. The $3 billion power plant is 
the largest foreign investment in India, and the dispute is closely watched 
as an indicator of India's hospitality to investors from abroad. India needs 
electricity badly, but many of its state electricity boards are cash-strapped 
due to widespread power theft and lax metering. The Dabhol dispute started 
about six months ago, when the MSEB defaulted on monthly bills totaling $48 
million. 
Dabhol's critics claim its tariffs are unreasonably high, which Dabhol 
denies. Among other things, Dabhol says MSEB draws only about 15% of the 
plant's capacity, down from an average 60% or so before the dispute; the 
reduced usage boosts the per-unit price because the pricing formula includes 
some capital costs. 
In its letter, Dabhol says it rejected the 1.369-billion-rupee check because 
it came with a note saying it was submitted "under protest," a reference to 
the MSEB's decision last week to rescind the contract. "The MSEB cannot have 
it both ways," says the letter, signed by Enron executive K. Wade Cline. 
Either it's rescinding the contract, or "it is affirming the validity of the 
[contract]" by making payments. 
However, MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal said that after the check was rejected, 
the MSEB went ahead and direct-deposited a payment to a Dabhol account, 
unaware of the letter's contents. Mr. Bansal said that he hadn't read the 
letter yet, so he wouldn't comment on it. 
He said the MSEB is eager to pay because the April bill was due on Friday. A 
Dabhol official, while unable to confirm whether payment was received, said 
it would mark "the first time in history" that the MSEB has paid on time. Mr. 
Bansal disputed that, saying he believes the two previous bills were also 
paid on time.

Houston Chronicle
El Paso Corp. a villain or scapegoat in Calif. crisis? 
Californians' ire grows as case resumes 
By DAVID IVANOVICH 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau 
WASHINGTON -- The lights keep going out in California, and people there want 
someone to blame. 
California is pointing the finger at Texas' energy companies. And first up is 
Houston's El Paso Corp. 
The California Public Utilities Commission has accused El Paso of using its 
power in the natural gas market to drive up gas prices in California. 
That behavior, Californians say, has cost the state's consumers more than 
$3.7 billion in higher energy bills and exacerbated California's dire power 
woes. 
And they want the federal agency that regulates natural gas pipelines to 
force El Paso to hand over the profits from this deal. 
At issue is whether El Paso, the nation's largest gas pipeline company, 
violated federal law by purposely withholding capacity on the biggest gas 
pipeline serving Southern California during a crucial period when gas demand 
was on the rise last year. 
By refusing to make that space available, the state agency alleges, El Paso 
was exercising its "market power" to artificially hike prices and keep them 
high. 
El Paso counters that the run-up in gas prices was caused, not by its 
actions, but by an unanticipated -- and unprecedented -- surge in demand. 
And they argue the real problem is pipeline capacity constraints within 
California, not on the supply of gas moving in pipelines bringing gas to the 
state. 
When filed more than a year ago, the state's allegations went all but 
unnoticed by the public. 
But with blackouts expected to roll across California repeatedly this summer, 
the El Paso case has morphed from an esoteric regulatory dispute into the 
test case for the legal battles spawned by the state's power debacle. 
As they wait in darkened elevators and struggle to pay soaring utility bills, 
Californians discern a pattern, argues Bruce Cain, director of the Institute 
of Governmental Studies at the University of California at Berkeley. 
"It's the same story with slightly different details," Cain said. "And people 
in California are getting very, very irritable." 
Gov. Gray Davis and other Democratic leaders have repeatedly blamed 
"out-of-state" energy firms for the state's energy woes. And they have 
excoriated the Federal Energy Commission for failing to take decisive action 
to give Californians relief. 
As President Bush visits California today, Democrats are pointing to the El 
Paso case to show how companies from Texas are ravaging California. 
Whether El Paso is an appropriate target for their anger remains an open 
question. 
El Paso operates a major pipeline system that transports natural gas from 
producing basins in areas such as West Texas and Oklahoma to Southern 
California and other parts of the Southwest. 
For years, the state's two cash-strapped utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric 
and Southern California Edison, and a local gas distribution company, 
Southern California Gas, owned the rights to transport gas along the Edison 
pipeline system. 
But as California moved to deregulate its electric industry and encourage 
competition, the California Public Utilities Commission prodded the utilities 
to give up their capacity on the El Paso line. 
That made room for other gas marketing firms to move in. 
Houston-based Dynegy held the rights to the pipeline capacity for a while. 
Then an Enron affiliate took a brief turn. 
In February 2000, El Paso's pipeline arm, El Paso Natural Gas Co., opened the 
bidding again for about 1.2 billion cubic feet of pipeline capacity. 
That space accounted for about one-third of the capacity of the El Paso line 
and about one-sixth of the total pipeline capacity running into California. 
An El Paso affiliate, El Paso Merchant Energy Co., won the rights to that 
capacity for 15 months with a $38.5 million bid. 
The California Public Utilities Commission cried foul and asked the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission to force El Paso Merchant to "disgorge" its 
profits earned under the contract. 
(El Paso has earned $184 million in pre-tax profits since the contract began, 
Ralph Eads, president of El Paso Merchant, testified last week.) 
The case was turned over to Curtis L. Wagner Jr., an administrative law judge 
at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, who acknowledged it would be a 
bellwether case. 
This much was clear. Gas prices skyrocketed at the California border last 
year, rising from an average of $2.84 a thousand cubic feet in March 2000 to 
as high as $25.08 in December, according to Southern California Edison. 
That was no small issue for California's troubled power market because nearly 
one-quarter of electric generators in California are fired by natural gas. 
In making their case, California officials pointed to the difference between 
gas prices in the gas fields in the San Juan and Permian producing basins and 
in California at the other end of the El Paso line. 
Those price differentials began to widen while Dynegy held the capacity, 
state officials said, only to expand dramatically after El Paso Merchant took 
control. 
El Paso Merchant admits significant portions of its capacity went unused. And 
the company acknowledges it was not successful at finding other players to 
take the space, despite the interest of several potential bidders. 
California officials insist the company only went through the motions of 
trying to find other shippers to take the pipeline capacity because it wanted 
to limit supplies. 
Perhaps the most tantalizing evidence in the case surrounds a Valentine's Day 
2000 presentation made by El Paso Merchant officials to El Paso chief 
executive William Wise. 
The El Paso Merchant documents are still largely held under wraps by the 
court, although portions have been revealed and others were obtained by the 
New York Times. 
In those documents, El Paso officials acknowledged the deal for the pipeline 
capacity would give the company "more control" over gas markets, including 
"the ability to influence the physical market," the Times reported. 
Lawyers for the plaintiff tried to argue that El Paso officials had crossed 
over the invisible line that is supposed to separate the operations of the 
regulated gas pipeline business and the unregulated gas trading arm. 
Wagner grew irritated with Eads last week when the El Paso Merchant executive 
appeared to equivocate when asked whether Wise approved Merchant Energy's 
plans 
"I feel you're trying to pull something over my eyes, which I don't 
appreciate," Wagner said, adding: "You have to get my blood pressure up to 
get the truth out of you." 
Wagner responded by ordering Wise to fly to Washington for an unscheduled 
appearance on the witness stand. 
Wise conceded he had, indeed, approved El Paso Merchant's plan to make a bid 
for the pipeline capacity, although he said he left it up to El Paso Merchant 
managers to decide the specifics of that bid. 
For El Paso's part, Harvard University professor Joseph Kalt argues that the 
real problem is a lack of capacity on the systems inside the state of 
California. 
In other words, even if El Paso had delivered more gas along the pipeline, 
the intrastate pipeline network would not have had the capacity to take that 
gas to users there. 
Eads also argued that if El Paso officials had been trying to push up gas 
prices, they would not have used a risk management technique known as 
"hedging." 
Hedging allows a company to protect itself against a major drop in prices, 
but it also keeps it from reaping the full benefits of a jump in prices. 
El Paso Merchant had suffered $691 million in hedging losses through March 
31, including $429 million in the first quarter of this year. 
"If we had thought that we could drive up prices ... we certainly would not 
have hedged," Eads said. 
And as for the infamous Valentine's Day, El Paso officials insist the 
comments were misconstrued, although they still want those documents to be 
kept secret. 
Testimony in the case will resume today. Wagner plans to issue his opinion by 
June 30. 




Enron India: No Comment On Power Tariff Cut Reports

05/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp.'s (ENE) Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., 
Tuesday declined to comment on whether it would cut its power tariffs after a 
second round of talks with a top panel set up to try and resolve an ongoing 
power supply dispute. 
After a 90-minute meeting between officials from the state and central 
governments, Maharashtra State Electricity Board and Dabhol executives, an 
Enron spokesperson said he wouldn't comment on newspaper reports Tuesday that 
Dabhol Power Chief Operating Officer K. Wade Cline had told domestic lenders 
the company is ready to cut power tariffs by 10%.
Power tariffs, deemed "unaffordable" by the state government, are at the core 
of this simmering dispute. The $3.0-billion Dabhol power plant in western 
India will generate 2,184 megawatts of power when the second phase is 
completed later this year. 
After the meeting, Cline said Dabhol Power "submitted no proposals before the 
committee." Dabhol Power has consistently maintained it won't renegotiate the 
power purchase agreement between the company and the MSEB, which sets tariffs 
for consumers. 
Industry analysts say Enron may be willing to reduce the power tariffs if it 
can find other buyers for its electricity. At the moment, the state 
electricity utility is the only buyer and has defaulted on $48.0 million of 
power payments. 
Earlier in the day, an Enron spokesperson also declined to comment on a 
report New Delhi has turned down a Maharashtra state proposal that seeks the 
National Thermal Power Corp. or the Power Trading Corp. to buy and distribute 
Dabhol's power. 
Indian state officials said another meeting of the panel will be scheduled 
for later but no date has been fixed yet. 
Indian financial institutions with more than 50% loan exposure to Dabhol 
Power will meet Wednesday to devise a strategy prior to their meeting with 
foreign lenders in early June in a bid to save the power project, senior 
officials at the Industrial Development Bank of India said Monday.

India's Gokak on Talks With Enron on Dabhol: Comment (Correct)
2001-05-29 04:26 (New York)


     (Corrects typographical error in first paragraph.)

     Mumbai, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- A.V. Gokak, the Indian
government's nominee in discussions with Enron Corp.'s Dabhol
Power Co. in a dispute with the western province of Maharashtra,
speaks after a meeting between the power utility and the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board. This is the first time  Gokak
has attended a meeting to resolve the stand-off over payments by
the board to Dabhol.

     ``India is very keen for a resolution of this issue.
     ``We will play an active role,'' in solving the payment
dispute, he said.
     ``We will take into account interests of all sides.''

     He declined to comment on newspaper reports that the
government has rejected a proposal that Dabhol may be allowed to
sell power to other state-run utilities.



Enron Rejects Govt-run Power Buyer's Legal Notice, Paper Says
2001-05-28 23:26 (New York)


     New Delhi, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.-promoted Dabhol
Power Company has rejected the government-run Maharashtra State
Electricity Board's legal notice terminating their power purchase
agreement, Business Standard reported, citing Managing Director K.
Wade Cline's written reply.
     In the reply, Enron said ``the legal notice is not acceptable
to us, as according to the PPA (power purchase agreement), the
MSEB does not have the right to rescind the agreement,'' the paper
reported.
     The Maharashtra electricity board Thursday told Dabhol Power
it was canceling the contract, six days after the company served
the board notice it was set to pull out of the project, India's
largest single foreign investment, in six months.
     Meanwhile, Indian lenders to Dabhol will meet Wednesday to
discuss ways to convince overseas counterparts to salvage the $3
billion power project, which is caught up in a payment dispute.
     Dabhol is owed 3 billion rupees ($63.9 million) for power
supplied in December and January. The board has refused to pay the
bills saying they're too high. It has imposed a 4 billion rupee
penalty on Dabhol for failing to supply power at full capacity on
Jan. 28.


Enron Unit's Cline on Discussions With Indian Panel: Comment
2001-05-29 03:25 (New York)


     Mumbai, May 29 (Bloomberg) -- Wade Cline, managing director
of Enron Corp.'s Dabhol Power Co., comments on a meeting between
Dabhol and a committee that was set up to resolve a stand-off over
payments by Maharashtra State Electricity Board. MSEB owes Dabhol
3 billion rupees ($63 million) for power supply in December and
January.

     ``We had a good meeting. We discussed a lot of things.
Discussions are ongoing and we'll meet again.''

On Dabhol's plans to cut power tariffs by 10 percent:

     ``No proposals were submitted before the committee.''



INDIA: UPDATE 2-Enron, India panel make no progress on power row.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

05/29/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 29 (Reuters) - Talks between U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's 
Indian unit and a government panel ended on Tuesday without resolving a 
contentious dispute over a giant $2.9 billion power project, officials said. 
But they said the talks will continue.
Participants at the meeting, which lasted an hour, discussed the issue of a 
reduction in tariff rates charged by Enron's unit for the power it sells to 
Indian state utility the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), 
government and company officials said. 
Also discussed was the option of a third entity, apart from the sole buyer 
MSEB, purchasing the power from the second phase of the project. 
"We had a good meeting. We discussed a lot of issues. But no proposals were 
submitted," K. Wade Kline, chief operating officer, Enron India Pvt Ltd, told 
reporters. 
V.M. Lal, principal secretary to the Maharashtra government, said the 
discussions will continue with Dabhol Power Company, which is 65 percent 
owned by Houston-based Enron . 
"We are negotiating on the various issues that are coming in the way of the 
project," he told reporters, adding that no date has been fixed for the next 
meeting. 
Enron and MSEB have been sparring for over six months on the 2,184 MW 
project, which was originally slated to sell its entire output to MSEB at a 
fixed price. 
The row is seen as a test case of India's ability to attract foreign 
investment in the power sector, which needs 100,000 MW over the next 10 years 
to meet growing demand. 
MSEB began buying the 740 MW of power produced by the the project's first 
phase in May 1999, but late last year, it started to default on payments 
saying the tariffs were too high. 
It also decided against buying the 1,444 MW of power produced by the 
project's second phase, which is expected to be delayed from its scheduled 
completion next month. 
Dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase deal over this 
issue and said the cost of power will drop when the second phase is completed 
and the plant switches over to a cheaper natural gas fuel. 
RENEGOTIATE TARIFFS 
To resolve the dispute, the Maharashtra government formed a panel last month 
to renegotiate the tariffs, headed by former bureaucrat Madhav Godbole who 
had earlier chaired a committee which recommended a series of steps to bring 
down the project tariff. 
Dabhol had said before Tuesday's meeting, that it does not agree with the 
committee's recommendations and hence does not believe the new panel would 
find a solution. 
The meeting was attended by key executives of Dabhol, the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) and representatives of the federal and state 
governments. 
Indian lenders to Dabhol will meet in Bombay on Wednesday to try and find a 
way to protect their interests in the project, a lender said on Monday. 
The meeting's top priority will be the adoption of a common strategy to 
convince foreign lenders not to invoke guarantees issued by local financial 
institutions and banks. 
The project, which is being built at a total cost of $2.9 billion, is being 
funded through $2 billion of loans. Of this amount, local lenders have 
contributed $1.4 billion and foreign lenders have provided the rest. 
Foreign lenders are protected by guarantees issued by domestic banks and 
financial institutions. They have called a meeting on June 5 and 6 in 
Singapore to discuss invoking guarantees on their loans in the project. 
At stake is not just the investment in the project, but also India's efforts 
to reform the power sector. Indian lenders would also take a hit on their 
books if their foreign counterparts insist on payments. (Additional reporting

INDIAN GOVT REJECTS PROPOSAL TO BUY POWER FROM DABHOL PROJECT

05/29/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

NEW DELHI, May 29 Asia Pulse - The Indian federal government has refused a 
proposal by the Maharashtra state government that it purchase electricity 
from the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company, which is currently embroiled in 
a legal battle with the state. 
"How can Central utilities buy power from DPC and sell it elsewhere when it 
is not possible for the Maharashtra government to buy it," the federal Power 
Minister, Suresh Prabhu, told PTI in an interview.
"A solution has to be found out which will have to be both in the national 
interest as well as acceptable to the investors... by asking National Thermal 
Power Corporation to buy power we can't have a solution," he said. 
Stating that he had made his stand clear to the Maharashtra Chief Minister, 
Vilasrao Deshmukh, when he came with the proposal to meet him and the Finance 
Minister, Yashwant Sinha, Prabhu said "what appears a solution can prove to 
be a precursor to a problem later." 
In the wake of the ongoing fight between DPC and the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board over the payment issue and legalities of power purchase 
agreement, Deshmukh had asked the federal government to bail out the state by 
instructing the NTPC and the Power Trading Corporation (PTC) to buy power 
from the second phase of DPC, to be commissioned later this year. 
Prabhu said states were the users of the electricity and not the federal 
government, which was only playing the role of a facilitator by generating 
and supplying power.

Enron's India Unit Willing To Cut Tariffs By 10% - Report

05/29/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Dabhol Power Co., the Indian unit of Enron Corp. 
(ENE), has told its domestic lenders that it's willing to cut tariffs by at 
least 10% in an attempt to resolve a dispute with Indian authorities. 
"The DPC (Dabhol Power) managing director met me recently. He is agreeable to 
cutting tariff by 10%. I am sure it can even be reduced further," S.K. 
Chakrabarti, chairman and managing director of the Industrial Development 
Bank of India, was quoted by the Business Standard newspaper as saying 
Tuesday.
IDBI has a total loan exposure of 21.58 billion rupees ($1=INR46.9750) to 
Dabhol Power. 
The $3 billion Dabhol Power project, India's biggest foreign investment 
project, is situated in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The project, which will generate 1,444 megawatts of electricity when the 
second phase is completed later this year, is at the center of a dispute 
between the state government and Dabhol Power over what the government claims 
are "unaffordable" power tariffs. 
The statement government hasn't been paying its dues to Dabhol Power and the 
company on May 19 issued a preliminary termination notice to the Maharashtra 
State Electricity Board, or MSEB. 
Indian financial institutions with outstanding loans to Dabhol, including 
IDBI, will meet Wednesday to agree on a common stance prior to their meeting 
with foreign lenders in early June. The lenders are hoping to save the power 
project, which is facing severe cash flow difficulties because of nonpayment 
by the state electricity body. 

Separately, a negotiating panel that includes officials from the state and 
central government and MSEB will meet senior executives of Dabhol Power later 
Tuesday in a bid to resolve their differences. 
In a separate report Tuesday, the Financial Express newspaper said the Indian 
government had rejected a proposal by the Maharashtra government that 
National Thermal Power Corp. or Power Trading Corp. be asked to buy and 
distribute power from Dabhol Power. 
The report quoted unnamed government officials as saying that the 
consequences of commercial decisions taken by the state government or the 
MSEB won't be passed on to consumers across the country.

INDIA'S DABHOL POWER SET TO SLASH TARIFF BY 10%, SAYS IDBI CHIEF

05/29/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

MUMBAI, May 29 Asia Pulse - Enron promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) is 
ready to slash its tariff by 10 per cent after the second phase of the 2,184 
mw project is functional in June first week, the leading financial 
institution Industrial Development Bank of India (IDBI) acting chairman and 
managing director S K Chakrabarti said here. 
"DPC has assured its Indian lenders that it was willing to reduce the tariff 
after firing of the 1,444 MW second phase. The per unit price would also 
reduce by another 10 per cent when the plant switches to Liquified Natural 
Gas as fuel", Chakrabarti said.
He said there was hope that DPC's tariff would come down at Rs 3.50 per unit 
after LNG use. 
Meanwhile, Indian lenders would meet on May 30 to chalk out a strategy for 
pressurising their foreign counterparts not to escalate the crisis by 
withdrawing from the USD three billion project. 
"There is a rift between domestic and foreign lenders, but the forthcoming 
meeting will formulate our future course of action to convince the latter not 
to precipitate the crisis any further in the June 4-6 Singapore meet", he 
said. 
"IDBI's exposure to DPC project is to the tune of Rs 21.58 billion (US$459 
million) including guarantees worth Rs 15.28 billion and rupee loans of Rs 
6.30 billion," Chakrabarti said. 
For the first time, the Indian lenders today disclosed their exact exposure 
to DPC, which stood at Rs 66 billion. Chakrabarti said adding other domestic 
lenders were ICICI, State Bank of India and Canara Bank.

ENRON'S DABHOL POWER CO REJECTS STATE BOARD'S LEGAL NOTICE

05/29/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

MUMBAI, May 29 Asia Pulse - Enron's Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has rejected 
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's (MSEB) legal notice for 
"rescinding" the PPA, saying "it did not have the right to do so," as the two 
partners get ready to plead their case before the state Electricity 
Regulatory Commission (MERC) tomorrow. 
In a three-page response to the MSEB's May 24 legal notice, Enron India 
managing director K Wade Cline has said "The legal notice is not acceptable 
to us, as according to the PPA, MSEB does not have the right to rescind the 
agreement," the state government sources told PTI here today.
In its notice, the MSEB has questioned the legal validity of the entire PPA 
as per the Indian Contracts' Act (ICA) 1872 and later also went a step 
further by filing a petition in MERC. 
"Other than non-acceptance of our legal notice, the DPC has continued its 
demand for an escrow account, knowing fully well that MSEB has filed a caveat 
in the Mumbai high court for not activating the sam," sources said. 
The DPC has also demanded an increase in LC (letter of credit) amount in line 
with the PPA, as the MSEB was supposed to do 21 days before the firing of its 
second phase on June six, they said.

GEB to issue bonds against old debts
Kamlesh Trivedi

05/29/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

WHEN the dispute over past outstanding has turned relations between Enron and 
Maharashtra state Electricity Board sour, Gujarat state Electricity Board has 
come out with a trend setting concept to retire past debt of independent 
power projects. 
GEB has decided to issue bonds worth Rs 650 crore to two of the three 
independent power projects in the state, Gujarat Powergen Eenergy Corporation 
and Gujarat Industries Power Company Limited against their old debts.
Bonds will be issued by GEB during the first week of June. GPEC will be 
issued bonds worth Rs 400 crore, while GIPCO will be issued bonds worth Rs 
250 crores to settle the past dues according to sources in the state energy 
department. 
GPEC will be issued bonds with option of four, five and six years of maturity 
period. While GIPCO, which will be issued bonds worth Rs 250 crore, will have 
maturity period options of six, seven and eight years. 
With a fluid situation in the market, GEB is still indecisive about the 
coupon rates to be offered on bonds to IPPs. A similar offer for the third 
independent power project Essar power, is believed to be in the process. 
GEB, which has been facing severe financial crunch for the past few years, 
will now be worried only about current power purchase bills raised by IPPs. 
Thanks to subsidy payment arrangement in cash on monthly basis facilitated by 
Gujarat Electricity Regulatory Commission, GEB now has some liquidity to pay 
current bills of IPPs and so IPPs are worried only about the past dues, said 
sources. 
Past accumulated outstanding of the independent power projects was a major 
headache for GEB. Infact, two of the three IPPs, GPEC and Essar power had 
brought in pressure on the state government to settle down the past dues. 
Outstanding had become such a serious issue, that at one point of time, Essar 
power, in its wisdom, had also considered dragging the state government to 
the court.

INDIA: Enron's Dabhol to meet key govt panel on Tuesday.

05/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, May 29 (Reuters) - Officials at U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's Indian 
unit are scheduled to meet with a state government panel on Tuesday to 
discuss the fate of a controversial $2.9 billion power project. 
But analysts said the meeting is unlikely to yield any result as Dabhol Power 
Company, owned 65 percent by Houston-based Enron , has already announced that 
it regards the meeting as a courtesy call only.
The panel was formed last month by the Maharashtra state government to 
renegotiate the tariffs charged by the 2,184 MW power project. 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which agreed in 1995 to buy the 
plant's entire output, says the power is too costly and has defaulted on $48 
million of power payments. 
Dabhol issued a notice this month to cancel its power purchase deal. 
The Maharashtra government has asked the panel to renegotiate the project 
with Dabhol and bring down the tariff. 
The panel is headed by Madhav Godbole, a former bureaucrat, who earlier 
headed a committee which recommended a series of steps to bring down the 
project tariff. 
Dabhol has said that it does not agree with the committee's recommendations 
and hence does not believe the new panel would find a solution. 
LENDERS MEET 
Indian lenders to Dabhol will meet in Bombay on Wednesday to try and find a 
way to protect their interests in the project, a lender said on Monday. 
The meeting's top priority will be the adoption of a common strategy to 
convince foreign lenders not to invoke guarantees issued by local financial 
institutions and banks. 
The project is being built at a total cost of $2.9 billion, of which $2 
billion has been funded through loans. Of this amount, the local lenders have 
contributed $1.4 billion and foreign lenders have provided the rest. 
Foreign lenders are protected by guarantees issued by domestic banks and 
financial institutions. They have called a meeting on June 5 and 6 in 
Singapore to discuss invoking guarantees on their loans in the project. 
At stake is not just the investment in the project, but also India's efforts 
to reform the power sector. Indian lenders would also take a hit on their 
books if their foreign counterparts insist on payments.

QATAR: Qatar says Dolphin deal not set back by Enron exit.

05/28/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DOHA, May 28 (Reuters) - Qatari Oil Minister Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah 
said momentum had not slowed on a $3.5 billion project to route Qatari gas to 
the United Arab Emirates after Enron Corp bowed out of Dolphin Energy Ltd 
(DEL). 
"Actually it is the opposite, for there are seven international firms each 
larger than Enron that are competing for its stake," Attiyah was quoted by 
the official Qatari news agency QNA as saying late on Sunday.
Enron last week sold its 24.5 percent stake in DEL to the UAE Offsets Group 
(UOG) for an undisclosed amount, raising the UAE firm's stake to 75.5 
percent. 
DEL has said several companies, including its other partner in the project, 
France's TotalFinaElf , were interested in acquiring Enron's stake. 
In March, Qatar and DEL signed a "commmercial term sheet agreement" which 
outlined the conditions of the upstream agreement for the long-awaited 
project. 
The two sides aim to sign a production sharing agreement before the end of 
the third quarter 2001.

India: Dabhol project: Politics of power

05/28/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

IT ALWAYS looked as if the Maharashtra Government had a definite plan while 
renegotiating with Dabhol Power Company (read Enron). The plan perhaps was to 
get some cosmetic changes in tariff and give DPC large benefits such as sales 
tax exemption for naphtha; reduction in interest rates of loans; and third 
party sales in the hope of getting the Centre to make NTPC and other Central 
utilities buy the costly power. This would look as if the contract has been 
renegotiated to ease the burden on Maharashtra when in fact the burden would 
have been distributed among several States and the Centre. The ultimate 
beneficiary would be Enron which would continue to keep a contract executed 
so blatantly against public interest. The real objective of the Maharashtra 
Government and perhaps the Centre is to give the controversy a decent burial. 
The party was spoilt by a statement by the Nationalist Congress Party 
President, Mr Sharad Pawar, criticising the re- negotiating Committee 
Chairman, Mr Madhav Godbole. The latter resigned, but was convinced to 
retract it. But it cannot be forgotten that it was Mr Pawar as Chief Minister 
of Maharashtra, who had bypassed a lot of objections to give the project to 
Enron.
Now it has become convenient for the Maharashtra Government to say that the 
State is suffering because of the decisions of the BJP-Shiv Sena Government. 
While the role of the BJP-Shiv Sena Government in reopening and permitting 
Phase II and integration of the LNG terminal, by which means Enron can 
recover the capital costs many times over, is utterly deplorable, it can not 
be lost sight of that it was Mr Pawar's government that brought in Enron. 
As Mr Praful Patel rightly said in STAR News' Newshour, the project had the 
blessings also of the then Prime Minister, Mr P. V. Narasimha Rao, and his 
Finance Minister, Dr Manmohan Singh. All of them, pushing for reforms, wanted 
a project in double-quick time and they ignored the several layers of 
approval process. 
The real story is described in a civil suit filed in 1995 by the then 
BJP-Shiv Sena Government in the Bombay High Court. It is another matter that 
this civil suit was mysteriously withdrawn after the Enron head, Ms Rebecca 
Mark, met the powers that be in Maharashtra, including the Shiv Sena chief. 
The suit - drafted by such eminent lawyers as, Prashant Bhushan, Nitin 
Pradhan, C. J. Sawant, the then Advocate General, and F. S. Nariman - tells 
the interesting story of how the Pawar government went out of its way to 
favour Enron by giving approvals even after the elections were announced and 
conducted in the State - a gross violation of the election code. To this day, 
neither the Congress nor the BJP-Shiv Sena nor the NCP governments has had 
the courage to speak the truth -perhaps because all of them were 
beneficiaries. Here are a few passages from the suit to judge the actions of 
the Pawar government: A After the calling of elections for the Maharashtra 
State Assembly, after expiry of its full term, the following documents came 
to be executed namely (i) Amendment to PPA dated 2/2/1995, (ii) Consent 
Agreement dated 23/24.2.1995, and (iii) Fuel Management Agreement dated 
25.2.1995. As mentioned above, all the aforesaid documents were in aid of and 
supportive of the PPA dated 8.12.1993 (later amended as mentioned above). 
Elections were called for by a press note dated 8.12.94 and a notification 
date 10.1.95 and were held from 9-12 February, 1995, but announcement of 
results was deferred in order to complete election process in other States 
which were to take place. It was this deferment of results which was taken 
advantage of and the letters/agreements were executed and/or exchanged during 
this period. 
A By reason of Clause 2 of PPA, the status of the PPA was that of an 
agreement not enforceable by law until all conditions precedents had been 
fully satisfied and/or bona fide waived as provided in the PPA itself. 
However, by a letter dated 25.2.1995 these conditions precedents were waived. 
The so-called waiver was not bona fide but was deceptive and fraudulent. 
* The unholy haste with which the purported financial closure was sought to 
be achieved was clearly in order to reap the benefit of the huge sum of $20 
million admittedly already spent by the principal shareholder of the First 
Defendant (Enron) described by them euphemistically as 'educational 
expenses'; (the testimony of Ms Linda Powers specifically states that: 
"Moreover, our company spent an enormous amount of its own money 
approximately $20 million on this education and project development process 
alone not including any project costs... Why do we, and other developers 
include such things in our project? To win local support and support of the 
authorities, and contribute to the general improvement of conditions, and 
contribute to the general improvement of conditions in the area". In the 
purported refutation also enclosed in the letter dated 18.8.1995 of the First 
Defendant, it is stated that $20 million included "engineering, financing, 
legal, travel and administrative costs actually totalling a sum in excess of 
$20 million as of 29.3.1995.") * 20.6.1992 - (within five days of arrival in 
India and within three days of arrival in Bombay) The Enron team arrived in 
India on June 15 and spent two days visiting various sites in addition to 
meeting people in Delhi and Bombay. A memorandum of understanding was signed 
between the Second Defendant (represented by Mr Ajit M. Nimbalkar), then 
Chairman of the Second Defendant, Ms Rebecca Mark of Enron, and Mr Douglas 
Mcfadden of General Electric Corporation. 
The term sheet annexed to the MoU opens with the following: "Electrical Power 
Purchase Contract" - Contract for 20 years term between Power Venture and 
MSEB to be structured to achieve an all in price of US$ 0.073/kWh, comprised 
a fixed monthly capacity payment calculating at the Indian rate of inflation 
each year and a per-kWh energy payment equal to the per-kWh operating cost 
(as defined below). 
(ii) Thus, the purported decision to set up a huge power generation project 
in the private sector with a foreclosed obligation on a statutory corporation 
to buy power from the private sector at a predetermined unprecedentedly high 
rate was taken in a great hurry without there being any public debate on the 
said issue apart from there being any detailed consideration of the matter. 
A Before the PPA was executed in December 1993, the following events 
occurred: 
(a) The World Bank expressed its opposition to the project and advised that 
it was not viable, not in the interest of Maharashtra in particular and the 
country, the public and the consumers, in general. This objection was brushed 
aside by Enron which said, in a letter, that "the World Bank opinion can be 
changed", that "we (Enron) will engage a PR firm and hopefully manage the 
media from here on" (June 1993). 
A The Central Electricity Authority had drawn attention to several aspects of 
the MoU including: 
(i) The all-in price is a departure from the existing norms and parameters 
notified by the Government under Section 43 A(2) of the Electricity (Supply) 
Act, 1948. 
(ii) Denominating the price in US dollars is also a departure from the 
existing norms. 
(iii) We take it that the price of 0.073 kWh will be applicable from 1996 
when power would be available. 
* The PPA violates the tariff guidelines in force issued on December 8, 1993. 
The tariff guidelines permitted only a return of 16 per cent on equity but 
the PPA allows a return much in excess of 25 per cent. 
Second, the tariff notification puts a cap on Operation and Maintenance (O&M) 
charges at 2.5 per cent of the capital cost. In the case of the PPA the O&M 
changes were over Rs 90 crore annually which is over three per cent of the 
capital cost. The PPA was not even structured in accordance with the said 
notification. 
The tariff notification allows payments only for the actual fuel consumed and 
not for deemed consumption. In the present case the heat rate guaranteed by 
the Dabhol Power Company to the MSEB is 7605 BTU per unit while the heat rate 
guaranteed by GEC to DPC is considerably lower. Under the PPA about 25 per 
cent of this difference and deemed consumption and actual consumption is 
allowed to be retained by DPC, contrary to the tariff notification. 
All these are but a few paragraphs of the 600-page civil suit. Perhaps had 
the then Maharashtra Government persisted with the arbitration the 
compensation would have been far less than what could be anticipated now. 
However, for reasons best known to the BJP-Shiv Sena combine, the suit was 
withdrawn and its government appointed a review committee which integrated 
the LNG plant with the power plant and gave the green signal for the second 
phase. The net result was a higher tariff than what was negotiated by the 
Pawar Government. 
The project has come a full circle now. Now the effort is on to distribute 
the burden across the country. This is evident by the Maharashtra Government 
turning to the Centre and its representative A. V. Gokak, and stating that 
the Centre is evaluating various options including of the Power Trading 
Corporation to buy the power from DPC and distribute it to all the States. 
But at what price? Not lower than negotiated under the PPA of course with 
cosmetic concessions by Enron and a lot of sacrifices by the State and the 
Centre. But is this what we want?

French power plays trample Mediterranean sensitivities

05/28/2001
South China Morning Post
8
(c) Copyright 2001 South China Morning Post Publishers. All Rights Reserved.

An electric storm is raging over the western Mediterranean. French power 
plays have become a charged issue in Italy and Spain. French state monopoly 
power company Electricite de France (EdF) caused a furore in Rome last week 
by grabbing 20.1 per cent of Italian industrial group Montedison. 
Montedison has majority holdings in energy producers Edison and Sondel. 
Together, these two modern and thrusting companies, soon to be merged, have 
6,000 megawatts of generation capacity - 12 per cent of Italy's active 
production capacity. Projects coming on stream will take that share to about 
22 per cent within three years.
Italy's shocked response was to rush through a decree limiting voting rights 
of foreign companies buying into its generation industry to 2 per cent - 
unless Italian companies are allowed reciprocal access to the buyer's 
domestic energy markets. 
It is a response learned from the Spanish Government, which has suspended the 
voting rights of the foreign companies that recently acquired its 
fourth-largest power company, Hidrocantabrico. One of those is Electricidade 
de Portugal (EdP), 30 per cent owned by the Portuguese Government. The other 
is Germany's third-largest producer, Energie Baden Wuerttemberg (EnBW), 34.5 
per cent owned by the French monopoly EdF. 
Spain is acting under a new "EdF Law" intended to keep state-owned foreign 
groups from controlling its utilities. The thinking behind it is similar to 
Madrid's restrictions on shareholdings by foreign telecommuications companies 
in which governments still hold a "golden share". The golden-share law, used 
to scupper a deal between Spanish phone company Telefonica and Holland's KPN, 
has been challenged by the European Commission. 
This is not what the European Union's single market is supposed to be about. 
The idea is to foster free movement of capital and investment between member 
nations, not to give governments the excuse for nationalistic grandstanding 
and protectionism. 
Nor is EdF is the kind of investor the single market was designed to 
encourage. France is liberalising its electricity market more slowly than 
many other EU countries, permitting only the minimum outside competition 
allowed under EU rules. It also bans companies from taking a stake in EdF. In 
a sense, EdF is doing what state monopolies facing eventual privatisation 
always do - moving into markets where liberalisation is further advanced and 
barriers to entry are lower. 
It has a war chest overflowing from a high domestic-price policy and can snap 
up newly privatised shares of other former monopolies abroad or buy stakes in 
struggling newcomers. 
That is what it has been doing in Italy, where the former state monopoly Enel 
is being forced to sell off capacity. Much would have gone to Montedison, but 
it may go elsewhere if EdF is seen to be in control. 
Eventually, EU pressure to liberalise will mean EdF will have to face serious 
competition on its domestic market. Some market opening has already been 
forced on it, despite the best efforts of the French Government. 
The company says it has already "lost 48 clients, representing roughly 3 per 
cent of sales, to the benefit of the German companies RWE and E.On, America's 
Enron, Spain's Endesa, the Franco-Belgian company Electrabel and [upstart 
French rival] Suez," reports the Paris daily Le Monde . It will also have to 
put a further 6,000 megawatts, or 6 per cent of production, up for sale later 
this year as a condition for EU approval of the EnBW purchase. 
But that is not enough to satisfy its neighbours, who want EdF tamed, at 
least for as long as it remains under state protection. The EU's commission 
would dearly like to be able to agree. 
Commission President Romano Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, 
uncomfortably admits Brussels needs to study what can be done about companies 
which can buy but cannot be bought. Commissioner for Energy Loyola de 
Palacio, who happens to be Spanish, has argued fiercely there is no point in 
privatising state companies only to have them re-nationalised by someone 
else's government. 
Nonetheless, the commission has taken Spain to court over the golden-shares 
law and is investigating the decision against EnBW and EdP. Mr Prodi has also 
signalled he will also "look very closely" at the Italian law. 
Fearing the battle could reverse years of painful effort to liberalise the 
utilities market, the commission argues it is better to pressure Paris to 
open the French market than to let Rome and Madrid close theirs. That is 
correct in principle. Market liberalisation is a fundamental pillar of 
European integration and national barriers cannot simply be re-erected at the 
first sign of cross-border investment. 
In practice, however, the Italian and Spanish reactions may be rather more 
effective at concentrating French minds than lectures from Brussels. 
If EdF finds its foreign forays thwarted, it may decide for itself that some 
domestic liberalisation is necessary. 
After all, a little competition at home may be a relatively small price to 
pay for the success of an international expansion programme intended to 
ensure half the company's sales are generated outside France by 2005. That is 
double the proportion achieved in 2000.

Feeling the heat over energy, Bush to visit California
BENNETT ROTH, Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau
Staff

05/28/2001
Houston Chronicle
3 STAR
1
(Copyright 2001)

WASHINGTON - After keeping his distance from California for months, President 
Bush finally will travel to the Golden State today to confront an energy 
crisis that threatens to darken the futures of politicians on both coasts. 
The trip comes at a time when the White House and California's Democratic 
Gov. Gray Davis have been engaged in a cross-country war of words, each 
blaming the other for the state's rolling blackouts and escalating energy 
prices.
Prodded by nervous state Republicans who fear voters are coming to see the 
White House as indifferent to the crisis, Bush will focus on energy problems 
during the two-day swing. 
The trip tentatively includes a tour of Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, a 
speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council and a trip to Sequoia 
National Park. 
Perhaps most significant, Bush has agreed to meet with Davis - at the 
governor's request - to discuss their differences over how to resolve the 
energy crunch. 
The stakes are high for both. Although Bush and Davis are of different 
parties, political experts say voters in the nation's most populous state 
could hold both of them responsible for a summer of inconvenience and high 
utility bills. 
"Voters don't look at the energy crisis in an ideological mode," said Allan 
Hoffenblum, a Los Angeles-based Republican consultant. "It is, `Why can't I 
turn on my lights?' and, `Why are my electric rates so high?' " 
A recent poll by the Public Policy Institute of California found that voters 
statewide gave both Bush and Davis low marks in the way they have dealt with 
the energy crisis. The survey found 56 percent of Californians disapproved of 
Bush's handling of the matter. Davis fared even worse, with 62 percent of 
respondents saying they are unhappy with his performance. 
For many Republicans, Bush's visit is not a moment too soon. 
Having lost all but one statewide elected position in their increasingly 
Democratic state, they have been eager to get a high- profile Republican 
there to rally the troops. 
Furthermore, some political observers say Davis' latest strategy - linking 
Bush to the Texas-based energy companies the governor charges are responsible 
for high prices - is beginning to resonate with voters. 
"He is pointing his fingers at (energy-price) gougers in Texas and gougers in 
Houston," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a senior scholar at the University of 
Southern California. 
She was referring to recent attacks by Davis and other Democrats against 
Houston-based Reliant Energy and Enron Corp., which have supplied energy to 
California. 
Until recently, Bush has been reluctant to return to a state where voters 
rejected him by a 12-percentage-point margin last November. The big loss came 
despite the fact that Bush campaigned hard there and pumped millions of 
dollars into a statewide effort. 
Since assuming office, Bush has traveled to more than half of the states 
before scheduling a trip to California. 
And he has waited longer than any president in the last three decades to make 
his first visit to the Golden State. 
Bill Clinton, who cruised to two California victories, headed to the West 
Coast after his first month in office and returned frequently. 
Critics say Bush has been trying to avoid the energy mess, which is the No. 1 
topic from San Diego to San Francisco. 
Initially, White House advisers dismissed the state's energy crunch as a 
self-inflicted crisis caused by a flawed deregulation plan. 
When administration officials suggested that state officials solve their own 
problems, Democrats responded that the message from Washington was "Bush to 
California: Drop dead." 
But more recently, the administration has sought to be more attentive to the 
energy shortage after California Republicans warned of a possible voter 
backlash in the 2002 midterm elections. 
Bush ordered federal facilities, including the sprawling military bases in 
the state, to reduce energy consumption by 10 percent. 
And he has directed the federal government to expedite permits for new power 
plants that the state desperately needs. 
But the president's long-term energy strategy unveiled this month did not 
address the state's short-term problems. 
And the administration has adamantly rejected Davis' pleas to have the 
federal government cap the price of wholesale electricity in the state. 
White House officials say price caps distort the market and would not solve 
the major problem facing California, which they argue is not generating 
enough electricity to meet demand. 
Furthermore, they contend, price caps would even harm the state in the long 
run. 
Nevertheless, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor will use his 
meeting with Bush to once again request that the president approve a ceiling 
on electricity costs. 
"The governor wants to ensure there is some short-term price relief by the 
administration," said Maviglio. "I think the longer the president stays in 
California, he will hear at every meeting and at every turn about energy and 
price gougers. So, hopefully, he will be compelled to do something about it 
instead of being AWOL about it." 
White House spokesman Ari Fleischer disputed California Democrats' contention 
that the president has ignored the crisis. 
"The president's focus is going to be on solving problems," Fleischer said. 
"He is not interested in finger-pointing. And that's what the president has 
done on energy policy in this country, whether people agree or disagree with 
the specifics of his energy plan." 
However, even the president's long-term energy strategy, which emphasizes 
more oil drilling and nuclear power plants, may be in peril now that 
Democrats have regained control of the Senate following Vermont Sen. James 
Jeffords' defection last week from the GOP. 
Democrats already have said they are unlikely to approve some of Bush's more 
controversial proposals, such as drilling in the environmentally sensitive 
Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The scuttling of such oil-drilling 
plans is likely to be well- received in environmentally conscious California, 
said political expert Jeffe. 
She added that Jeffords' move also will benefit California because the 
state's two Democratic senators, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer, are 
likely to gain clout in the Senate. The senators have complained that the 
Bush administration has not consulted them on energy policy. 
Recently, the state's Democratic Attorney General Bill Lockyer sharpened his 
attacks on Enron's top executive, Ken Lay. Lockyer said his office would like 
to file civil and criminal charges against the energy supplier. 
According to a Wall Street Journal article Tuesday, Lockyer said, "I would 
love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he would share with a 
tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' " 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne responded that Lockyer's comments do "not even 
dignify a response." 
But Denne said the scheduled meeting between Bush and Davis "is certainly a 
step in the right direction."

Los Angeles Volts, Quotes and Votes From the Elect Among Us

The Other Spike in Energy Rates Vivid political rhetoric is a moribund art, 
and California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer's effort to revive it with a humdinger 
of a quote has brought shocked, shocked responses. 
Lockyer, who is investigating possible manipulation of wholesale electricity 
prices by energy firms trading in California, told the Wall Street Journal, 
"I would love to personally escort [Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth] Lay to an 8 
[-by-] 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my 
name is Spike, honey.' "
A GOP group calling itself The Loyal Opposition noted primly that Lockyer's 
suggested act would expose the state to "civil and possibly criminal 
liability." 
And Gary Ackerman, executive director of a generators' and marketers' trade 
group called the Western Power Trading Forum, said state Controller Kathleen 
Connell rang him up to apologize for Lockyer. 
She called "to express her regrets over comments made by an elected official, 
a colleague of hers," Ackerman said. "She wanted to distance herself from 
those kinds of comments." (Top Democrats in the Capitol will tell you that 
the contrary-minded Connell has already been distancing herself from them for 
a long time.) 
Lockyer was a known phrasemaker back in his Legislature days. When Doris 
Allen--the Orange County Republican who was briefly the state's first woman 
Assembly speaker--was driven out by fellow Republicans for cutting a deal 
with Democrats to get the job, she characterized her enemies as 
"power-mongering men with small penises." That prompted Lockyer to declare, 
apropos of male legislators, "I guess that makes us the Congress of Vienna 
Sausages." 
Lockyer's office says with a sigh that "those focusing on the colorful 
language are missing the point--that we're not afraid of energy companies and 
we are serious about going after them for any wrongdoing." 
Putting Teeth in That Comb 
It's been the law for years, but who knows from his-and-her prices? In 1995, 
it became illegal for merchants to use gender alone to charge women more than 
men for the same services, from haircuts and dry cleaning to car repairs. 
Yet when Hannah-Beth Jackson, the Assembly Democrat representing parts of 
Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, went to her Santa Barbara dry cleaners, 
she found that she was being charged $1.25 each for her husband's shirts, and 
$3 each for her blouses of comparable fabric and style. The cleaner said the 
blouses were too petite for the presses and needed hand ironing. 
She was steamed, and when you get a legislator steamed, you feel the heat. 
Jackson has pushed through a bill putting bite in the 1995 law, and requiring 
that prices for such services be posted. 
She did, however, pass on more aggressive requirements, like forcing barbers 
to charge less to tend the sparse, see-through hair of older men than for the 
jungle-dense coiffures of younger men. Consider her husband's thinning 
thatch, she said: "That's precision work. They've got to make every hair 
count." 
Political Hustle Meets Real Muscle 
Give credit where credit is due: Some of his party's leaders rail against 
popular culture, but Dana Rohrabacher, the Republican congressman from 
Huntington Beach, has been a fearless practitioner. He hung out with Van 
Halen singer Sammy Hagar, and took up surfing (though he passed on a 
challenge by surfer Sally Alexander, his 82-year-old Democratic opponent, to 
a "surf-off" in 1996). He even got his chin liposuctioned a while back. 
Now he's bucking anti-Hollywood rhetoric by enlisting one star the GOP dotes 
on, so much so that his name was bruited about as governor material: Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
The Austrian-born actor is turning star power into $tar power at a 
$1,000-a-plate fund-raiser for Rohrabacher June 9 in Newport Beach. 
Rohrabacher met the actor through an ex-bodybuilder turned chiropractor who 
treated Rohrabacher's bad back, back when it was. 
For the congressman's money, Schwarzenegger is "not only a draw with the 
voters but with the financial supporters." And why would a man in a district 
as safe as his need to raise money? "We have redistricting coming up. It's 
always prudent to have some money in your bank account." 
Here Lies . . . 
There's no marker on the runway at LAX to commemorate President Bill 
Clinton's notorious $200 haircut, but Los Angeles' Rancho Park Golf Course 
now has a bronze plaque set in a boulder to memorialize Clinton's golf game 
there last August. 
The marker reads "President of the United States William Jefferson Clinton 
played golf at Rancho Park Golf Course August 12, 2000," and beneath it the 
names of three officials, one of whom was in the First Foursome--L.A. Mayor 
Richard Riordan. 
Clinton didn't turn in a scorecard, but his game was said to be "around 85." 
Former Clinton White House aide Ben Austin, now deputy mayor to Riordan, says 
that in spite of reports to the contrary, "presidents don't cheat at golf. 
Presidents' opponents cheat for them," a statement bolstered by former 
President George Bush, who marveled after he left the White House, "It's 
amazing how many people beat you at golf now that you're no longer 
president." 
The Thrilla on Capitol Hill-a 
Nancy Pelosi, the San Francisco Democrat, has spent some recent time of her 
14 years in Congress angling to get California back into the House 
leadership, with herself as majority whip, the person who keeps party members 
in line and counts noses before big votes. 
Alas for Pelosi, the GOP kept its majority in the November elections, and 
there was no room at the top. Even if there had been, fellow Demo Steny H. 
Hoyer of Maryland was already jockeying for the same job. 
But wait! The consolation prize of minority whip may be opening up. Michigan 
Rep. David E. Bonior might soon quit as whip to campaign if he decides to run 
for governor in 2002. 
Get cracking! 
Quick Hits 
The Legislature, which voted unanimously in 1996 to adopt energy 
deregulation, voted unanimously again last week--this time to adopt an 
official state tartan, that of the family of pioneering naturalist John Muir. 
. . . The chads will stay in Kern County for now, since the county found that 
buying new optical scanners would cost more than its entire annual elections 
budget. . . . For brevity, there's no beating the retirement memo of Ron 
Reina, longtime aide to San Diego County Sheriff Bill Kolender: "And to all, 
'Good Night.' " 
Word Perfect 
"He never really apologized. . . . Holding no one accountable only sanctions 
these kind of dirty tricks." 
Los Angeles County supervisor Gloria Molina, contesting just what constitutes 
an apology. After learning that his campaign used an imitation of Molina's 
voice and name to dis his mayoral primary opponent Antonio Villaraigosa, Rep. 
Xavier Becerra said in a long press release that he had telephoned both 
Villaraigosa and Molina and "offered an apology on behalf of my campaign." No 
way, said Molina; what she heard from Becerra was a "long-winded" narrative 
devoid of mea culpas.

2003 mayoral race casting a shadow
JOHN WILLIAMS
Staff

Houston Chronicle

(Copyright 2001)

THE 2001 MAYORAL race has barely started. No television commercials have 
aired; no debates have blared. Incumbent Lee Brown has yet to formally 
announce. 
But already, some are laying groundwork for 2003.
Three prominent businessmen - Ned Holmes, Ken Lay and Marc J. Shapiro - are 
talking with politicos and others about running for mayor in two years. There 
are others, including developer Ed Wulfe, Brown's confidant. 
And while these powerhouse names provide colorful speculation about the 
political scene two years hence, they also cast long shadows on this year's 
landscape because each now prefers Brown to serve a final term. 
The concern atop the glittering towers of commerce is that Houston needs 
another businessman at the helm, someone with the can-do abilities of the 
past mayor, Bob Lanier. 
But not yet. 
The increasingly image-conscious business leadership does not want Houston 
portrayed nationally as the city that booted its first black mayor. It's 
important for the power elite, still mostly white, to be seen as coexisting 
with minorities. 
And there is political reality. It's hard to win citywide without support 
from a black community that tends to vote as a bloc and was a significant 
factor in electing four of the last five mayors. 
Supporting the term-limited Brown for his final two years could pay dividends 
later. 
Taking stock of their futures 
Working behind the scenes, Holmes, Lay and Shapiro are taking stock of their 
political futures. It is unlikely that they would would run against each 
other. But each wants to know where he stands and who might make the best 
candidate. 
Holmes already has taken a step. Though he chaired fund-raising for Rob 
Mosbacher, who lost to Brown in the 1997 runoff that put Brown in office, 
Holmes now raises money for the mayor. 
That allows Holmes to freeze money that might go to other candidates while 
earning political points from Brown's black supporters. 
Lay, the chairman of Enron Corp, is testing the water with various community 
leaders. While many view Lay, with his strong ties to the Bush White House, 
as being above local politics, there is a growing trend of business titans 
running for mayor. 
Shapiro is being quieter. As vice chairman of finance, risk management and 
administration for Manhattan Chase Bank, he lives in New York City, though he 
has a house in the enclave city of Hunters Creek inside west Houston. He 
would need to establish formal residency in Houston to run. 
None of the three cared to talk about 2003 ambitions, though Holmes joked, "I 
encourage the other two to run all the time." 
But their specter presents problems for Brown's two major opponents this year 
- City Councilmen Chris Bell and Orlando Sanchez. Besides the incumbent, they 
face a formidable shadow candidacy from one of the three. 
Success will require balance 
A subliminal message to voters, especially those in predominantly white west 
Houston, is to wait for two years. 
If Bell or Sanchez wins, defeating either could prove difficult after one 
term, when problems can still be blamed on the predecessor. 
For Brown, the challenge may be to convince these same voters he's doing his 
job well enough that they can afford to wait before replacing him. 
Everyone involved will be keeping a keen eye on the polls. 
Brown has maintained a strong, though not insurmountable, lead. But in recent 
weeks he's whirled in a vortex of bad news that could drain his lead. 
Should Brown's support drop this summer, it is not unimaginable that a 
business leader might jump in. Remember, Lanier didn't enter the race that 
eventually unseated Kathy Whitmire until August 1991. 
And in two years, it now seems likely that Houston's traditional white 
business establishment will offer up one of its own for mayor. 
In either case, political success will require a delicate balance of power, 
money and subtlety, lest the run appear as heavy-handed manipulation by lords 
of political largesse. 
It assumes that a white male can be the next mayor in a city where minority 
voting often controls at-large elections. And many voters might view such 
posturing as presumptuous.

THE NATION Bush Comes Calling to an Edgy California Politics: President hopes 
to make amends with Davis, voters. Outcome could color future ties.

WASHINGTON -- When President Bush arrives in California today for the first 
time since taking office, he will engage Gov. Gray Davis in a private 
discussion that could become the domestic equivalent of a peace summit. 
Davis plans to press his case for caps on wholesale electricity prices, 
something Bush insists would worsen the state's power crisis. Bush wants to 
show Californians that he cares about their plight, and he plans to highlight 
his administration's efforts to promote conservation.
As tends to be the case with summits, solutions are likely to be elusive, 
progress incremental. 
Bush's California tour begins Tuesday morning at Camp Pendleton, where he 
will tout his efforts to reduce electricity use at military bases. After 
that, he speaks to the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. On Wednesday, he 
visits Sequoia National Park. 
The Bush-Davis meeting, to be held sometime Tuesday in Los Angeles, will 
certainly address the state's electricity turmoil, and it comes amid an 
escalating war between Democrats and Republicans over national energy policy. 
But there's more at stake than price caps. Davis and his administration want 
other things from Washington, from increased federal aid to help fight an 
insect threatening the wine industry to an exemption from a rule that could 
increase gasoline prices in California. 
On a grander scale, the meeting could determine what kind of relationship the 
Republican president and Democratic governor will have from this point on, 
and what kind of support Davis can expect from the White House on other 
important state matters. 
Also in play are the images of both men. 
"Politically," said Democratic strategist Darry Sragow, "both the president 
and the governor have been wounded. Their goal is to get the crisis off their 
back. . . . Substantively, we have a real crisis, and it requires the 
involvement of the state and federal government." 
Davis was elected governor in a 1998 landslide. But he heads into his 2002 
reelection campaign with plummeting poll numbers. A Field Poll released last 
week showed only 42% of registered voters in California approve of the job 
he's doing as governor, while 49% disapprove--a sharp drop from January, when 
60% supported Davis' performance. 
Bush is faring badly in California too. A private poll taken earlier this 
month on behalf of Public Strategies, a consulting firm that represents 
independent power generators, showed that 71% of the state's likely voters 
thought the president should be doing more to solve the energy crisis; only 
23% thought he was doing enough. 
Sragow assumes that advisors to Davis and Bush are debating among themselves 
over whether it serves their interests best to emerge from the talks 
appearing to be allies, or adversaries. "The public dislikes conflict and 
wants the problem of rising prices and threatened blackouts solved," he said. 
However, as Bush and Davis were preparing for the meeting, their aides could 
not even agree on who requested it first. 
Karen Hughes, counselor to the president, said Bush would listen to Davis' 
argument in support of price controls. However, she said the president still 
felt strongly that price caps would discourage investment in new power 
plants. 
Hughes disputed suggestions that the administration has neglected the state, 
which Bush lost to Democrat Al Gore by more than 1 million votes. 
"He came up short in the vote on election day in California, but he will not 
let that deter him from doing what is right for California," she said. "He is 
the president of all of the people of the United States." 
Bush was thought by some political analysts to be reluctant to visit 
California until he had an energy proposal he could point to as a response to 
the state's problems. But White House officials say the president's travel 
agenda during his first four months in office has been designed around 
legislative geography: He spent most of his time on the road visiting states 
where senators might be persuaded to support his tax cut. 
Dan Bartlett, one of Bush's communications advisors, said the White House 
always has regarded California as an important destination for Bush, even if 
he will have visited 29 other states before he arrives here. The state "has 
difficult times ahead of it [and] it's important the president and federal 
government help them through these difficult times," Bartlett said. 
Still, meetings between presidents and governors, particularly ones of 
opposing parties, invariably become studies in one-upmanship. That's 
particularly true when the governor is seen as a future presidential 
candidate. 
When President Clinton came to California, the White House rarely if ever 
deigned to inform Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. On rare occasions when they 
would meet--generally at out-of-the-way airports--White House officials took 
pains to show who was in charge, by changing meeting locations at the last 
minute, for example, or making sure that the president's chair was taller 
than the governor's. 
Wilson's relationship with Clinton was more strained than Davis' is with 
Bush. The combative Wilson repeatedly sued the federal government on issues 
ranging from voter registration requirements to demands for reimbursements 
for costs associated with illegal immigration. 
"It is smart of the Bush White House to hold a meeting with Gov. Davis," said 
Sean Walsh, a former Wilson spokesman. "One need only look at Davis' 
background. If the president didn't come, Davis likely would show up on the 
street with a milk carton with George Bush's face plastered on the side." 
So far, Davis has not sued over the energy crisis, although Democratic 
leaders of the Legislature have gone to court to compel federal regulators to 
make sure interstate electricity rates are "just and reasonable." 
But the governor has been amping up his rhetoric. He has retained consultants 
Chris Lehane and Mark D. Fabiani, veteran operatives from the Clinton 
administration, under a contract that will pay them $30,000 a month. Both are 
known for their attack-oriented tactics. 
On Thursday, Davis called Bush "practical" and "well-intentioned." At the 
same time, he threatened to sue the administration if his meeting with the 
president fails to produce desired results. 
"Give us relief. Find a way to give us relief," Davis implored. And if the 
president continues to refuse to impose price caps? "We're going to court 
then. The law says we're entitled to relief, and it hasn't been coming. We 
have a whole bunch of contingency plans." 
Even if the meeting produces no tangible results, it will be an opportunity 
to "tone down the rhetoric," said Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman 
Oaks). 
"You can't engage in a war with the president," the speaker added, because 
there are too many issues on which the state needs federal aid. 
But Bill Whalen, research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution 
and a former Wilson aide, demurred. "You can't tell me that with the 
Clinton-Gore spin machine now running [Davis'] communications that we're 
going to see a kinder, gentler governor," he said. "The big question for the 
White House is: Will they tailor their agenda to conform to California, or 
conclude that California doesn't fit into the national mainstream as they see 
it?" 
Bush is visiting a state that has become ground zero in a 
Democratic-Republican battle for public opinion over energy. 
With Democrats hoping to use the energy issue to gain control of the House in 
the 2002 elections, House Democratic Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri 
will be in Oakland on Tuesday and Torrance on Wednesday to turn up the heat 
on Republicans. On Friday, Democrats began running radio ads in five GOP 
lawmakers' districts in five states, assailing them and the administration 
for not doing more to bring down energy prices. 
Before the trip was announced, GOP lawmakers from California appealed to Bush 
to visit the state and counter Democratic criticism of the administration. 
The exchanges reached a new level of intensity when California's Democratic 
attorney general, Bill Lockyer, suggested in an interview published by the 
Wall Street Journal on Tuesday that Ken Lay, chairman of the Texas-based 
energy company Enron Corp. and a close friend of Bush, should be locked in a 
prison cell with a tattooed inmate named "Spike." 
One political analyst said that perhaps it was time for Sacramento and 
Washington to exchange ambassadors. 
Some observers see little downside to Davis' attacks--and the possibility of 
political gains for a governor whose popularity has declined significantly. 
"Which do you think Gray Davis cares more about--his dealings with Washington 
or his reelection chances?" Whalen asked. 
Because of its Democratic tilt, California was never going to be on the 
administration's "A list" for federal goodies, said one Washington lobbyist 
who works on California issues. 
Others, however, insist that the White House will not take actions designed 
only to punish California, no matter how estranged Bush and Davis become. 
"Bush is going to do what's right for California regardless of the governor's 
remarks," asserted Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). 
"Ultimately, the safety net for the state is the Republican delegation in 
Congress," said Marshall Wittmann, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson 
Institute. "They have the vested interest in ensuring that California gets 
its fair share." 
Even if Bush and Davis emerge from their summit shaking hands, the public 
shouldn't assume they have become partners in peace. 
In fact, Davis may have more to gain by aligning himself with another 
Washington figure whose influence expanded dramatically last week when Sen. 
James M. Jeffords of Vermont quit the Republican Party, tipping control of 
the Senate to the Democrats. 
"Davis does have a new friend in Washington," Whalen said, "but it's Tom 
Daschle," the South Dakota Democrat who is about to become Senate majority 
leader.

If political heat were light, California wouldn't have any more rolling 
blackouts. Unfortunately, Gov. Gray Davis and President Bush are fighting to 
a draw, leaving California and the broader national economy caught in the 
bickering middle. 
As Davis correctly argues, Bush could end California's crisis tomorrow by 
imposing firm and reasonable price controls on the Western region's wholesale 
electricity market. Bush says that such price controls would discourage new 
power plant construction and make our problems worse.
Let's take Bush's argument first: A small handful of large energy companies 
are manipulating the market from Seattle to San Diego--and laughing all the 
way to the bank. These energy conglomerates--Dynergy, Reliant, Enron, 
Williams and others--produce power for as little as a nickel or a dime per 
kilowatt hour and sell it into the Western states for prices spiking as high 
as a dollar during rolling blackouts. 
The result is not only the transfer of tens of billions of dollars of wealth 
from consumers and businesses to the energy companies, it is also a massive 
energy price shock that now threatens to pull the entire West Coast, and 
eventually the rest of the country, into a recession. 
Bush could easily short-circuit this recessionary shock by imposing a firm, 
regionwide price cap of 15 to 20 cents. This would end the profiteering and 
still provide ample incentives for generators to supply power and build 
additional power plants. Moreover, a regionwide price cap, as opposed to a 
California-specific one, would prevent generators from playing one state 
against another. 
This does not mean, however, that Davis is doing any better for California 
than Bush. Nothing illustrates Davis' incompetence better than his botching 
of the state's transmission grid purchase. 
This option had a dual purpose: provide cash to the near-bankrupt utilities 
to pay off creditors and get the system working again, and wrestle back 
jurisdiction over the wholesale electricity market from intransigent federal 
regulators. 
Davis failed miserably in closing that deal, with disastrous consequences: 
California remains dependent on the feds; Pacific Gas & Electric is in a 
bankruptcy court, and Southern California Edison continues to hover on the 
brink of receivership. 
Worst of all, the aborted transmission grid deal has left the utilities 
without adequate funds to pay off the state's small generators, and many are 
no longer willing or able to produce. This is perhaps the most important but 
least understood aspect of the current crisis. About 700 small generators 
provide roughly a fourth of the state's power. Davis' bungling has led to the 
loss of more than 3,000 megawatts of that supply. 
That means that when the lights go out and wholesale prices skyrocket, it is 
not necessarily because of a physical shortage of electricity but because of 
an artificially induced financial shortage. 
In hindsight, it is clear that Davis' worst mistake was not seizing the 
plants of the merchant generators who were ripping off California months ago. 
These generators bought the plants from the state's utilities after 
deregulation for a mere $3.2 billion. Since then, they have used the plants 
to "game" the market by withholding supply. Partly through such scurrilous 
methods, the generators have stuck Californians with an electricity bill that 
may eventually reach $100 billion. 
Adding insult to injury, Davis is now using taxpayer money on several 
high-priced "spin doctors" and the Democratic Party is using millions on a 
media campaign to redirect the public's anger toward the Bush administration 
and the Republicans. 
Let's give the public credit: It understands that it takes two politicians 
and two political parties to do the blackout tango.

Bingaman, Senate Energy Chief, Will Block Bush Plan (Update1)
2001-06-05 10:50 (New York)

Bingaman, Senate Energy Chief, Will Block Bush Plan (Update1)

     (Adds company names in fourth paragraph and details about
contributions in paragraph 23.)

     Washington, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- President George W. Bush
delivered his energy plan to Senator Frank Murkowski last month,
expecting the Alaska Republican to push it more or less intact
through the Senate and on to passage by the House.
     Now the package intended to boost oil and gas production and
ease some pollution controls is in the hands of Jeff Bingaman. The
New Mexico Democrat disagrees with Bush's approach and wants to
start fresh negotiations on what U.S. policy should be.
     Bingaman, 57, who's spent most of his 19 years in the Senate
out of the spotlight, will become chairman of the Energy and
Natural Resources Committee when Democrats take control of the
Senate later this week.
     Bush wants to make it easier for companies like Enron Corp.,
Exxon Mobil Corp. and BP Plc, to build power plants and pipelines
by easing regulations, and he's opposed to regulating the carbon
dioxide emissions blamed for global warming. Bingaman has
introduced legislation to cut emissions to curb global warming.
     The president's proposal to drill in the Arctic National
Wildlife Refuge, in trouble even with Republicans in charge, is
dead as long as Democrats have control. Bingaman has no plans to
consider it.
     Bush opposes caps on energy prices; Bingaman is cosponsor of
legislation to impose caps on wholesale energy prices in
California although, according to a spokesman, he'd prefer the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission do that on its own.

                         Seeking Consensus

     Bingaman says rather than offer his own plan now, he'll try
to sit down with Republicans and negotiate something both sides
can agree on. There is already agreement on some proposals, such
offering tax credits to encourage domestic drilling and the use by
business of renewable energy technology, such as wind-powered
turbines.
     ``Obviously, I'm going to work for consensus,'' he said.
``There's nothing about much of these issues that should be
partisan.''
     Bingaman says he hasn't decided whether to push a single,
comprehensive energy bill or move issues separately. Democrats may
insist on separate bills for political purposes, said Tim Evans, a
senior energy analyst at IFR Pegasus.
     ``They'll say, `Let's get all of the most vulnerable
Republicans on record supporting drilling and see if they get re-
elected,''' he said.
     Whatever his decision, Bingaman won't meet Murkowski's goal
to have a bill for Bush to sign on July 4.
     ``I'm not anxious to have some artificial deadline so that we
can have a bill-signing ceremony on a holiday,'' Bingaman said.
``I don't think that's the way to legislate.''

                     Visionary or Do-Nothing?

     Throughout his career, Bingaman has made a practice of taking
time to study an issue before acting.
     ``He's something of a visionary,'' said Bruce Black, a former
law partner who became a federal judge in New Mexico after
Bingaman recommended his nomination. ``He sees trends.''
     Opponents see inaction.
     ``He doesn't accumulate much in the way of negatives by not
doing much,'' said John Dendahl, chairman of the Republican Party
of New Mexico.
     Bingaman is a politician who doesn't stray from party
positions, Dendahl said. ``He's not a maverick. He's always been
when the chips are down a straight Democratic voter.'' In 2000,
Bingaman voted with the party leadership 87 percent of the time on
votes in which the two parties took opposing positions, according
to data compiled by Congressional Quarterly.

                        Fundraising Success

     In the Senate, Bingaman's strategy has been to home in on
issues that have been neglected, such as school accountability and
defense research that has civilian uses, work with others, and not
hog the credit.
     ``He wouldn't try to beat it to the front of the class,''
said Ben Alexander, a Bingaman fundraiser.
     That approach appears to have worked: Republicans haven't
been able to budge Bingaman from his Senate seat by appealing to
New Mexicans' distrust of party-line politicians.
     With Alexander's help, Bingaman built a campaign fund that's
helped him fend off rivals. He raised $2.7 million for his 2000 re-
election bid compared with his Republican challenger's $669,000.
     The $295,527 Bingaman got from oil and gas companies and
electric utilities made him the industry's sixth-largest
congressional recipient in last year's elections, according to the
Center for Responsive Politics.
     The oil and gas industry gave $32.6 million overall last year
in campaign contributions. The top contributor, Enron, a pipeline
and energy-trading firm, gave $2.4 million. Exxon, the world's
largest publicly traded oil company, followed with $1.4 million
and BP, the third largest publicly traded oil company, donated
$1.3 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

                     Comparison With Murkowski

     Environmentalists said Bingaman will balance conservation and
production concerns better than Murkowski.
     ``Murkowski wants to jam through an agenda'' to boost
production, said Alyssondra Campaigne, legislative director of the
National Resources Defense Council. Bingaman ``tends to be more
studious and thorough.''
     As chairman, Murkowski has pushed a comprehensive bill that
includes tax incentives to promote the use of alternative energy
and opening 1.5 million acres of the 19-million acres of the
Alaska refuge to oil and gas exploration.
     Bingaman has proposed leasing land in the Gulf of Mexico for
oil production, and that concerns environmentalists.
     ``It would put too much at risk in coastal resources,'' the
NRDC's Campaigne said.



USA: TECO breaks ground on 599-MW Arkansas power plant.

06/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - TECO Energy subsidiary TECO Power Services held 
a groundbreaking ceremony Tuesday on its 599-megawatt natural gas-fired power 
plant in Dell, Ark. 
Actual construction on the Dell Power Station began in March, the company 
said in a statement.
One megawatt provides enough electricity for about 1,000 average homes, 
therefore the Dell plant will provide enough electricity for about 600,000 
homes. 
National Energy Production Corp. (NEPCO), a subsidiary of Houston-based 
energy giant Enron Corp. , is building the plant. 
The Dell plant, along with a sister plant, the McAdams station in Kosciusko, 
Miss., are designed to interconnect with the Entergy transmission system. 
Both will sell electricity to wholesale customers in the Southeast and 
Midwest, TECO said. 
Dell is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2002. 
Tampa, Fla.-based TECO Energy units include Tampa Electric, Peoples Gas 
System, TECO Transport, TECO Coal, TECO Coalbed Methane, TECO Propane 
Ventures and TECO Solutions. TECO Power Services have announced projects to 
serve customers in 18 states, spanning the southern half of the U.S. 
TECO Energy has ownership in nearly 11,000 megawatts, operating, under 
construction or in advanced stages of development worldwide.

UK: Intl bonds-Telecoms suffer despite positive market.

06/05/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 5 (Reuters) - European telecoms firms were hit by rumours of new 
issuance and profit taking in the international bond markets on Tuesday while 
other industries enjoyed stable prices on good market sentiment. 
The Reuters CorpTop index and traders had telecoms spreads - the difference 
between the yield on corporate and similarly dated government bonds - between 
two and four basis points wider on Tuesday.
Industrial companies and utilities, however, traded two to three basis points 
tighter. 
The fall in telecoms bonds prices was partly caused by strong indications 
from investment banks that Deutsche Telekom is on the verge of launching a 
deal for between five and 10 billion euros. 
"That rumour has caused some repricing today bu we also have profit taking 
after a month-long rally in telecoms prices caused patly by a fall in equity 
volatility and partly by a feeling that the harsh part of the storm may have 
passed," said one London-based trader. 
Telecoms bonds have benefitted from a feeling among many investors that the 
immediate danger of credit rating downgrades and further bad news has now 
passed. 
"Telecoms is a roller coaster but maybe the twists and turns are a little 
more gentle than they were four months ago," said one Paris-based trader. 
"Also remember that many of these companies are household names and that 
attracts the retail market while the possibility of getting a heavier coupon 
on further downgrades attracts those out looking for risk," she added. 
A good run, however, has triggered some selling as investors look to cash in. 
British Telecom's 6.125 percent, February 2006 bond, for example, was trading 
two basis points wider on the day, traders said. 
Meanwhile, Deutsche Telekom's 6.125 percent July 2005 issue was trading out 
seven basis points by 1400 GMT. 
Investment banks have been in talks with the German telecom giant for several 
months regarding a jumbo bond issue, but Deutsche Telekom's need to make 
coupon repayments on outstanding bonds in June and July mean an announcement 
is expected soon. 
Bankers said they expected the bond to be entirely denominated in euros as 
this is where the operator can achieve the best cost of funding. 
Deutsche Telekom issued a $14.6 billion transaction last year which was the 
largest corporate bond sale ever at the time. 
Moody's put Deutsche Telekom's A2 long-term rating on review for a possible 
downgrade in March while S&P placed its A-rating on review for a downgrade in 
February. 
In the primary market insurance firm Swiss Life launched a 300 million euro, 
0.50 percent exchangeable bond which can be switched for shares of HSBC 
Holdings or Swiss Life itself. 
An official from lead manager Lehman Brothers said that the bond was three 
times oversubscribed and that a 50 million euro greenshoe - extra bonds held 
by the underwriter and released if there is sufficient demand - was also 
sold. 
The bond was entirely sold to European investors and all buyers where from 
major financial institutions, the official said. 
Elsewhere in the primary market the European bank for Reconstruction and 
Development launched a one billion euro five-year deal. It priced at 52 basis 
points over the 4.625 percent May 2006 U.S. Treasury. 
Meanwhile, Energy giant Enron sold 10 billion yen due 2004. 
British supermarket chain Sainsbury announced that it plans to launch a 
benchmark euro bond in the near future. Deutsche Bank and HSBC will lead the 
transaction.

Natural gas generators considered to ease electricity demand, prices

06/05/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

EUGENE, Ore. (AP) - Natural gas generators could ease demand and prices for 
electricity in the southern Willamette Valley, where businesses and utilities 
are bracing for skyrocketing rates and power shortages. 
The biggest proposal is a 500-megawatt power plant that Texas energy giant 
Enron Corp. may build on industrial property in the Coburg area, possibly on 
the site where Willamette Industries runs a wood products plant.
By comparison, Eugene and neighboring Springfield use a total of about 450 
megawatts. 
The rest of the proposals are for smaller operations that mostly would be 
connected to local businesses and mills. 
"Everyone's looking for power," says Frank Lambe, general manager of the 
Emerald People's Utility District. 
Even if the Enron plant is built within Emerald's service territory, it 
doesn't mean the local utility would get any of the power. 
Enron, with revenues of more than $100 billion, typically sells power to the 
highest bidder. 
In fact, an Enron plant likely would require Emerald to buy another 10 
megawatts of electricity on the open market to run the plant's lights, 
heating and other needs. 
Emerald board member Katherine Schacht, who represents the Coburg area, said 
she's concerned that the power from the Enron plant would go to California 
rather than helping meet local energy needs. 
She also said "there are a lot of questions that need to be asked and 
answered" about the plant's impact on water, air quality and other issues. 
The Enron plant would be similar to those now under construction in the 
Hermiston area and in Klamath Falls. Those plants are several stories high, 
emit large amounts of carbon dioxide and consume between 2,000 and 2,400 
gallons of water a minute. 
Carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, isn't a regulated pollutant. 
Enron and the businesses considering their own generators would buy natural 
gas from the main north-south pipeline that runs down the Willamette Valley. 
The plans are only preliminary, but they illustrate growing concern about 
future price increases that could reach 100 percent this fall and worries 
that the region will suffer energy shortages for the next several years. 
Many businesses also see a chance to make money by generating electricity in 
a market with wholesale prices that have jumped over $300 a megawatt - 10 
times the going rate a year ago. 
Enron hasn't applied for any permits for a plant in the Eugene area, nor has 
the company given the state an official notice that it intends to build the 
plant. 
But Enron has notified the Bonneville Power Administration, the federal power 
marketing agency in Portland that supplies the Northwest with half its 
electricity, that it is considering building the plant. 
If Enron does build a plant in the Eugene area, it would need a permit from 
the Lane Regional Air Pollution Authority to emit nitrogen oxides and any 
other contaminants. 
A large plant also would need approval from the Oregon Energy Facilities 
Siting Council, as well as local jurisdictions if it requires land use 
changes.

Waste Management to Start Trading Pulp and Paper (Update1)

Waste Management to Start Trading Pulp and Paper (Update1)

     (Adds closing share price.)

     Houston, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- Waste Management Inc., North
America's largest trash hauler, formed a pulp- and paper-trading
group to help control the risk of price swings from its recycling
business.
     The largest recycling company, Houston-based Waste Management
expects trading to begin in the third quarter, the company said in
a Business Wire release. It runs 190 facilities for collecting
such items as paper, plastic, glass and aluminum.
     Trading will begin gradually as the company emphasizes
management of the 4 million tons of paper it handles annually,
President A. Maurice Myers said in the statement.
     Other companies also have begun trading in pulp and paper
items such as old newspapers and corrugated containers. Enron
Corp., an energy-trading and pipeline company, is applying its gas-
and power-trading models to paper. It owns a newsprint mill in
Garfield, New Jersey, and another in Canada.
     Waste Management shares rose 56 cents to $28.40. The company
had sales of $12.5 billion last year.


Profile: Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis?; Lowell Bergman, 
"Frontline" correspondent, Laura Holson and Joseph Kahn, The New York Times, 
discuss the energy crisis

06/04/2001
ABC News: Nightline
(c) Copyright 2001, American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

Announcer: June 4th, 2001. CHRIS BURY host: 
Rolling power blackouts, bankrupt utilities, skyrocketing electricity prices.
Unidentified Man #1: It is the most volatile commodity in the world. 
BURY: Are power generators gouging consumers? 
Unidentified Woman #1: I think it's pretty appalling that the folks who sell 
us power can charge whatever they want. 
Mr. KENNETH L. LAY (Chairman, Enron): And every time there's a shortage or a 
little bit of a price spike, it is always collusion or conspiracy or 
something. I mean, it always makes people feel better that way. 
BURY: And right in the middle, a federal agency you've probably never heard 
of. 
Mr. CURTIS HEBERT (Chairman, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): They 
didn't build this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it 
overnight either. 
BURY: Tonight, Power Play, Who's to Blame for the Energy Crisis? 
Announcer: From ABC News, this is NIGHTLINE. Substituting for Ted Koppel and 
reporting from Washington, Chris Bury. 
BURY: California is known as the great American incubator. From hem lines to 
Hula-Hoops, the Golden State gives birth to trends that often spread east. 
That is why so many states are paying close attention to California's 
troubled attempt at deregulating electricity. Last week, California Governor 
Gray Davis asked President Bush for help in the form of a price cap on power 
companies. The president said no. Now Governor Davis is threatening to sue 
the federal agency that regulates electricity prices. More on that later. 
But first, the results of a new ABC News/Washington Post poll. It suggests 
that President Bush is developing an energy problem. When asked what they 
think of the president's performance on energy, a clear majority, 58 percent, 
say they disapprove. That's up 15 percent since Mr. Bush released his energy 
plan. When asked if they think the United States is heading into an energy 
crisis, six in 10 Americans answer yes. 
TEXT: 
ABC News POLL The Washington Post 
Margin of Error +-3.0% 
How do you rate the president's performance on energy? 
June 3 May 13 
Disapprove 58% 43% 
Do you think the US is heading into an energy crisis? 
Yes 61% No 36% 
BURY: California is already there. For months now, The New York Times and the 
public broadcasting program "Frontline" have teamed up to investigate. Their 
collaboration, "Blackout," airs tomorrow night on many PBS stations. It 
documents a colossal mismatch in the brand new game of buying and selling 
power on the open market. It's like the New York Yankees against the Toledo 
Mud Hens. 
Unidentified Woman #2: We didn't use his five because their minimum was, you 
know, higher than what we were willing to pay. 
Unidentified Man #2: I'll sell you 108 now. 
BURY: (VO) On one side, companies such as Enron, the Texas energy broker, 
trade electricity like any other commodity. A sophisticated trading operation 
buys and sells billions of dollars worth of energy every day. It's the 
largest company of its kind in the world. 
Unidentified Man #3: See what I'm saying? 
KELLY: CRS. This is Kelly. 
BURY: (VO) On the other side, in this converted department store in 
Sacramento, is California's trading team. 
Unidentified Man #4: This is the operations center. This is the--this is the 
location where we make energy purchases and fill the state of California 
energy requirements. 
BURY: (VO) Here, employees drafted from the state's water department go 
head-to-head with the pros from Enron and other companies. Since 1999, the 
cost to California has skyrocketed from $7 billion to an estimated $60 
billion this year, an increase of 750 percent. And the demand for 
electricity, up less than 5 percent. 
(OC) In their documentary, reporters for The New York Times and "Frontline" 
address a fundamental question, who's to blame? Narrating this segment is 
"Frontline" correspondent Lowell Bergman. 
Unidentified Man #5: Our forecast reserves look like they'd be pretty thin 
over the peak as well. 
Unidentified Man #6: How much is... 
LOWELL BERGMAN reporting: 
(VO) The power industry blames the high prices on shortages brought on by 
California's failure to build any major power plants over the last decade, 
despite a booming economy. 
Mr. LAY: I mean, we have a supply/demand imbalance. Too much demand, too 
little supply in California. 
BERGMAN: (VO) Not everyone agrees. Consumer advocates in California accuse 
the generators of actually withholding supply. 
Ms. NETTIE HOGE (Executive Director, TURN): The idea that all of a sudden we 
had a supply crunch is preposterous. What happened is, all of a sudden, the 
new plant owners and the traders, like Mr. Lay's organization, looked at the 
data and figured out how to manipulate the market. As soon as that happened, 
the prices never went down again. If it was totally a supply problem, why 
would we have excess prices at 5:00 in the morning on Christmas Day when 
nobody but Santa is working? 
BERGMAN: (VO) The generators, in turn, say they shut down plants for routine 
winter maintenance. 
Mr. LAY: Every time there's a shortage or a little bit of a price spike, it's 
always collusion or conspiracy or something. I mean, it always makes people 
feel better that way. 
BERGMAN: But you know as well as I do that the price--it's nice for a 
business. 
Mr. LAY: Yeah. 
BERGMAN: You're in the business of--of making money for your shareholders. 
Mr. LAY: Mm-hmm. 
BERGMAN: Right, as a company? 
Mr. LAY: Yeah. 
BERGMAN: So you would be foolish, as you said, to turn down the kind of money 
you could make this past winter in California. Is--isn't there a... 
Mr. LAY: I--I--I think you put words in my mouth out there. 
BERGMAN: OK. 
Mr. LAY: I said we--we made some money in California. We made some money 
across the country and around the world. I mean, and as I tell my friends in 
California, Enron was doing quite well before California imploded. 
Unidentified Man #7: So you can't blame the Enrons. I mean, they're the 
guys--that's--that's what they do. They try to make as much money from the 
money that they get invested. You blame the regulators. 
BERGMAN: (VO) Across the country, tucked in an out of the way building behind 
Union Station in Washington, DC, sits the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission or FERC. FERC's commissioners are appointed by the president and 
control a $250 billion energy sector critical to America's economy. With the 
coming of deregulation, state control over wholesale electricity rates passed 
to the federal government, making FERC the final arbiter of just and 
reasonable rates. It's a power FERC has been reluctant to use. 
Curt Hebert is a protege of Senator Trent Lott, who convinced President 
Clinton to appoint Hebert to the FERC in 1997. In January, President Bush 
made him the FERC chairman, and Hebert has made no bones about where he 
stands on free markets. 
Mr. HEBERT: The rules of competition govern that economies work, that choice 
works. It's why we're American. We inherently like choice. It's why we left 
the mother country. We didn't like the rules they were setting. We wanted to 
make our own rules. We want our own choices and we believe that works. 
BERGMAN: OK, but is electricity different? 
Mr. HEBERT: It's a transition . It takes some time. Look, they didn't build 
this monopolistic system overnight, and we won't change it overnight either. 
Mr. WILLIAM MASSEY (FERC Commissioner): Without some effective price control 
this summer, I fear for the worst. 
BERGMAN: (VO) William Massey is a FERC commissioner, a Democrat, who has 
found himself in opposition to his chairman. 
Unidentified Man #8: Mr. Massey, what is the nub of the disagreement that you 
have with Mr. Hebert? 
Mr. MASSEY: I think what it boils down to is a philosophical disagreement 
about the role of my agency in ensuring just and reasonable prices. 
I think it's long past time for this agency to step in and--and impose a 
temporary time out on the markets. 
Mr. HEBERT: Well, that is the problem because these people are saying 
temporary, but they don't mean temporary. It's kind of like the temporary 
rent control you have in New York. It's not temporary at all. Matter of fact, 
you know, in Washington, DC, we don't do temporary very well, and that's a 
problem. 
BERGMAN: (VO) In fact, late last year, after six months of unrelenting high 
prices in California, the FERC finally did declare California's rates unjust 
and unreasonable, but took no action. 
Governor GRAY DAVIS (Governor, California): So they found these people guilty 
a year ago. They just haven't agreed on the sentence. 
BERGMAN: Well, we talked with Curt Hebert. And we got... 
Gov. DAVIS: Well that's, you know. 
BERGMAN: That's what? 
Gov. DAVIS: Lots of luck. 
BERGMAN: What do you mean, "Lot's of luck"? 
Gov. DAVIS: Because... 
BERGMAN: He's the federal--he's the guy you are turning to to give you the 
money. 
Gov. DAVIS: He is the chairman of the commission. But he has not been overly 
sympathetic to California. He's more of an ideologue than a problem solver. 
BERGMAN: Well, he's saying you just want him to give you short-term relief, 
price caps, which won't solve the problem. 
Gov. DAVIS: Problems meaning fattening the balance sheet of already 
enormously wealthy energy companies. 
BURY: How much blame do the energy companies really deserve? 
BERGMAN: Watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which are, 
to a certain extent, reflected in your electricity bill. And don't think that 
this couldn't happen where you are. 
BURY: And how much of this energy crisis did California bring upon itself? 
Those questions when we come back. 
Announcer: This is ABC News: NIGHTLINE, brought to you by... 
(Commercial break) 
BURY: Joining us from Boston, Lowell Bergman, the correspondent for 
tomorrow's "Frontline" broadcast. From our Los Angeles bureau, Laura Holson, 
a business correspondent for The New York Times, who's been covering the 
California energy crisis. And here in Washington, Joe Kahn, who reports on 
energy and economics for The New York Times. 
Laura, just before the break, we heard California Governor Davis blaming the 
energy companies and the federal regulators. How much of his argument is 
sinking in. In other words, whom do Californians blame for this? 
Ms. LAURA HOLSON (The New York Times): The interesting thing is Californians 
blame everybody for this ap--for what has happened with the energy crisis. 
They blame the governor for not responding quickly enough to a crisis that 
started, you know, a year ago, if you really, you know, look at when prices 
starting going up. They are angry at their utilities who they feel have 
failed them. They have often had very close kind of paternal relationships 
with their utilities and they feel that they've been cheated. And they are 
very angry with the power generators, in particular, who they feel are 
charging them just exorbitant amounts for energy. 
In particular, there was a company last week, a power generator that said it 
charged consumers, rather the utilities, 4,000, nearly $4,000 per megawatt 
hour, which is enough to light a thousand homes for one hour. And when they 
heard this, they were outraged. They just thought, you know, `How can this 
be? How can we get,' in their terms, kind of ripped off by power generators 
who are using them to make, you know, a lot of money. 
BURY: Joe Kahn we heard those poll numbers from this survey out tonight 
suggesting that President Bush has a bit of a public relations problem on 
energy. How is that going to affect the politics here in Washington? 
Mr. JOSEPH KAHN (The New York Times): Well, clearly the--President Bush and 
the White House are calculating that by the time people have to go to the 
polls to select a new president, a slew of new power plants will be online in 
California. Electricity prices, presumably, will come down quite a bit and 
their free market stance on this will not ultimately cost him at the polls. 
It's not as clear that Republicans in the Congress have the same commitment. 
This has already been a very turbulent time in Washington with the Democrats 
now in control of the Senate. I think you can expect to see a legislative 
initiative by the Democrats to introduce some kind of price caps in 
California. Some Republicans may sign on to that. Some have already indicated 
that they will. It's going to be a real knockdown political flight--fight in 
Washington over what the strategy ought to be. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, talk a little bit about that free market activity that 
Joe just mentioned. We saw the clip from your documentary with the--the 
traders from Enron pitted against the--the buyers from California. And I must 
say, it really did look like a mismatch. 
BERGMAN: Well, in fact, some of the people at Enron told us that they welcome 
the day when PG&E and Southern California Edison, the regular utilities get 
back in the marketplace because they do feel like they've got them, if you 
will, outgunned. And--but I should point out to the audience, that when Laura 
was talking about this $3800 a megawatt hour, which was Duke Energy Company, 
the normal price, if you will, the standard price for a megawatt hour was 
around 40 or less. So the level of profit that we're talking about is what 
people are upset about. And the problem here is--is primarily that in a free 
market and the way that the marketplace in California is set up in 
particular, there's no limit to what could be--could be charged when you get 
close to that area of scarcity with electricity. Electricity truly is 
different and as Jeff Skillings says in our documentary, he's the CEO of 
Enron, it is the most volatile commodity in the world. 
BURY: Yet, at the same time, Joe, we are seeing electricity traded as if it 
were oil or soybeans or steel. I mean, how is electricity different? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, for economic reasons, it's different in a--in a couple of key 
respects. For one thing, it's an absolutely vital commodity. People aren't 
prepared to do without it. Moreover, electricity powers every other part of 
the economy. So, it's one of these sort of fundamental rights that we have. 
In fact, as far back as the New Deal, Franklin Roosevelt made clear that 
electricity was so important that it would be subject to federal legislation 
guaranteeing everybody in this country just and reasonable electricity 
prices. 
BURY: But just and reasonable electricity prices, Laura, do you want to pick 
up the question of well, who determines what's just and reasonable here? 
Ms. HOLSON: Well, it's very clear that President Bush believes that the 
market, you know, sets what's just and reasonable. And, you know, that has 
not been what Governor Davis has said at all. He believes that because this 
is a commodity that people, you know, believe is guaranteed that there should 
be some price cap on it. It's an interesting, if you will, situation when 
business and politics kind of intersect. Governor Davis said very early on 
that he did not want two things to happen in California. One is that the 
utilities would go bankrupt and the second was that rates would be raised for 
consumers. And he's in a very tight spot right now because those two things 
that he did not want to happen indeed have happened. And it only looks like 
it will get worse this summer when experts have said Californians can expect 
another 260 hours of blackouts. 
BURY: Laura, we have to take a break. But when we come back, we want to 
address the question of whether power companies are doing what just comes 
naturally to them. Back with our guests in a moment. 
(Commercial break) 
BURY: We're back with "Frontline"'s Lowell Bergman and Laura Holson and Joe 
Kahn of The New York Times. 
Joe, aren't these power companies doing exactly what they are supposed to be 
doing, which is maxi--maximizing profits and to get the biggest return for 
their shareholders? 
Mr. KAHN: Sure. That's their responsibility. They--they have no excuse for 
arbitrarily lowering the price that they could charge for electricity if the 
market will bear a higher price. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, in your documentary, do you find any evidence that the 
power companies are--are gouging consumers or doing anything illegal? 
BERGMAN: Well, illegality, no one really has any serious evidence, although 
there have been lots of allegations and there's been lots of speculation 
about it. But we should also point out in the documentary and in The Times 
that some of the companies are starting to realize, it seems, that even 
though they are owed hundreds of millions, in some cases $500 million or more 
still by these bankrupt utilities, they're going to have to take a hair cut 
as Governor Davis describes it. They're going to have to make some bargain. 
And I think we may... 
BURY: Let me jump in there. What do you mean they're going to have to get a 
hair cut? 
BERGMAN: Well, apparently, that's Governor Davis's way of telling them that 
they're going to have to take less to a--less than a full dollar payment for 
what they are owed, and that there has to be some kind of settlement here of 
between the various parties, other we're not--otherwise we won't see any 
progress. 
BURY: Lowell, one of the old cliches in investigative reporting is follow the 
money. And much has been made of this argument that the Bush administration, 
accusations have been made, that the Bush administration is too cozy with the 
power companies and the power company regulators. What did you find in your 
reporting? 
BERGMAN: Well, we found that Vice President Cheney was very up front about 
it, I mean, about his relationship with Ken Lay, the head of Enron, the fact 
that he built a stadium for Enron when he was head of Halliburton. You know, 
the vice president is the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to hold 
presidential office in the history of the United States. So--but they are 
very open and up front and balance this relationship with their friends and 
with the people who they feel comfortable with. 
BURY: Laura Holson, this idea that so many Texas companies are profiting from 
California's misery, as it were, I suppose Californians find that 
particularly infuriating. 
Ms. HOLSON: It's funny, in the San Francisco Bay area when I was growing up 
near there, there was this great rivalry between the San Francisco 49ers, 
which is, as we all know, a football team and the Dallas Cowboys. And that 
seems to be replaced, if you will, with consumers in California who look at 
Texas gen--at, you know, a lot of the power generators, which are based in 
Texas, and who they feel now are just, you know, making a lot of money off 
them. It's--there's always been a rivalry between those two states. And now I 
think it's deeply personal because it's hitting consumers, or as they believe 
it, it's hitting them in their pocket books. 
BURY: Joe Kahn, how long before these new power plants are going to be coming 
on line? And before they do, or in the time before they do, what--what is it 
that the federal government can do to help California out? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, it--it will probably be about 18 months before sufficient new 
power comes online in California to start substantially changing the supply 
and demand equation there. And that's a very speedy pace. That's with a very 
expedited permit process for new plants. The governor in California has put a 
lot of effort into building new plats--plants quickly. 
BURY: So what happens between now and then? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, that's the question. That's the debate. The Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission has the power under the Federal Power Act, in fact some 
people argue it has the obligation under the Federal Power Act to ensure that 
just and reasonable electricity rates prevail in California at all times. It 
can't just selectively choose the times. And it has already found at the end 
of last year that rates in California are unjust and unreasonable. 
BURY: So what's it doing about that? 
Mr. KAHN: Well, it's--it's tried a variety of compromise measures so far, 
very limited price controls on certain kinds of electricity sales during 
emergency hours. So far that appears to be an insignificant contribution to 
reducing the overall electricity bill in California. 
BURY: Laura, Governor Davis is demanding wholesale price controls. President 
Bush has made it pretty clear that he's not going to lean that way. What 
options does Governor Davis have? 
Ms. HOLSON: You know, it's--again he's stuck in this place where it--it 
doesn't look like he's got any kind of real out. I mean, he can try to 
demand. He can demand as much as he wants from the power generators, but if 
the federal government doesn't step in, he really can't do anything. The 
interesting thing, at least I see kind of going forward, is how Californians 
have really adapted to a really, you know, awful situation. There's a law 
that's being proposed right now in California in which businesses will know 
months in advance whether their neighborhood is going to be impacted by a 
blackout so they can plan. I mean, we've almost turned into--if anybody 
remembers traveling through Italy during their college days, you always kind 
of knew when the airlines or the trains were going to go on strike because 
they told you a day ahead of time. And that's very much what's happening in 
California where they're warning people, you know, two days, an hour, you 
know, one day ahead of time so that they can prepare. 
BURY: That's a pretty dark scenario. Lowell, we just have a few seconds left, 
what lessons should the rest of the country take from California's crisis? 
BERGMAN: Well, watch your--your heating bills, your natural gas bills, which 
are to a certain extent reflected in your electricity bills. And don't think 
that this couldn't happen where you are. And I think that the industry itself 
is beginning to understand that the crisis in California may, in fact, impact 
on the future of deregulation nationally. 
BURY: Lowell Bergman, Laura Holson, Joe Kahn, thank you so much for joining 
us tonight. 
BERGMAN: Thank you. 
Mr. KAHN: Thank you. 
Ms. HOLSON: Thank you. 
BURY: When we come back, an update on a NIGHTLINE broadcast from just over a 
month ago.

BURY: In May, we profiled the case of death row inmate Johnny Paul Penry, 
convicted of murdering the sister of a former pro football player. Today, the 
Supreme Court overturned Penry's death sentence. It ruled, six to three, that 
the jury did not have clear instructions on how to weigh his mental 
retardation when it sentenced him. The court will take up the broader issue, 
whether executing the mentally retarded is cruel and unusual punishment, in 
its next term. 
That's our report for tonight. I'm Chris Bury in Washington. For all of us 
here at ABC News, good night.

The Dabhol Power Company, the Enron Corporation's unit in India, stopped 
generating electricity at its $3 billion power plant after its sole customer, 
the utility of the Indian state of Maharashtra, stopped buying power on 
Tuesday. The halt in power generation was the latest move in a months-long 
dispute that has cast doubt on the future of Dabhol's $2.9 billion power 
project in India, the largest foreign investment ever in India. Jimmy Mogul, 
a spokesman for Enron, which owns 65 percent of Dabhol, said the company 
remained open to discussions in the dispute, which involves overdue payments 
for power. Dabhol had issued a preliminary termination notice on May 19 
saying it was pulling out of the Indian project. Final termination requires a 
contractual six-month cooling-off period.

Spin Control: Spain Hits Turning Point At Windmill Parks --- Some Are Well

BARBATE, Spain -- The economy of this fishing community is as battered as its 
town hall, where dim lights flicker in the hallways and chips of paint flake 
off the walls. Up in his second-floor office, the mayor, Juan Manuel de 
Jesus, has an in-tray overflowing with troubles: a third of the town out of 
work; a desperately needed fishing treaty with Morocco; rising crime and drug 
abuse; and a big municipal budget deficit. 
But this morning, his thoughts revolve around a different irritant: windmills.
"Look at this," he says, unfolding on his desk a map of the countryside 
surrounding Barbate. Large yellow and green splotches -- a military training 
zone and a swarm of natural parks -- hem in the seaside town, leaving just a 
pair of white slivers. "Those are the only areas open for development," he 
says. His finger stabs one of the white areas near the Atlantic coast. "And 
that's where they're putting the windmills -- the one place we could have 
built a hotel, a resort, something that would bring us some jobs." 
The mayor sees the windmills as a blight on the land, driving away tourists 
and crimping more lucrative projects. Local environmentalists fret that the 
installation, with its rows of steel towers and sharp metal blades, will play 
havoc with migrating birds and mar the coastline as they did in nearby 
Tarifa, a windsurfing mecca on the Strait of Gibraltar. 
Tilting at windmills is nothing new in the land of Don Quixote. But wind 
power doesn't have to be like this. At the opposite end of the country, more 
than 1,000 kilometers to the north in the green hills of Navarra, 28 steel 
windmills perch on a ridge over a landscape that resembles a nature reserve. 
Cows nap in the shade of the towers, and the narrow gravel access roads 
follow original grazing trails. Electricity is transformed in a nearby 
substation built to resemble the neighboring stone houses. The approach -- 
the result of close cooperation between business and government -- has won 
accolades from environmentalists and business leaders alike. 
Spain, the world's No. 3 producer of wind power, has become a battleground 
for two competing models of developing the business: the hodgepodge of 
unsightly wind parks seen in the south and the carefully planned and 
unobtrusive installations found up north. The conflict is intensely local, 
with the country building enough new windmills to more than triple its 
wind-power capacity by 2005. But the model that prevails will have 
consequences far beyond the Iberian Peninsula. 
Anxious to clean up its environment and limit its dependence on imports of 
natural gas, the European Union has committed itself to generating 22% of its 
electricity from renewable energy sources by 2010. Yet less than 5% of the 
EU's electricity output now comes from windmills, thanks largely to poor 
execution and a brewing backlash. 
If Spain -- with its open spaces and relatively low population density -- 
can't sell the public on windmills, the EU will likely find it difficult to 
convince Europeans to accept more ambitious forms of alternative energy, such 
as biomass plants, which turn agricultural, animal and human waste into 
energy. The failure could also call into question the EU's commitment to the 
1997 Kyoto global-warming treaty, which U.S. President George W. Bush has 
been roundly criticized in Europe for rejecting. 
Few expected this turn in events back in 1996, when the EU first set a more 
modest 2010 target. At the time, wind power looked like the fresh breeze of 
the future. Soon, the union's most green-minded states, led by Germany and 
Denmark, were busily building wind parks to the applause of environmental 
groups, which saw wind power as a clean alternative to nuclear power and 
coal-burning power plants. 
But early enthusiasm led to shortsighted projects, leaving the European 
landscape littered with inefficient wind parks. Germany, for example, quickly 
became the world's largest producer of wind power, with 6,113 megawatts of 
capacity installed at the end of last year. But the breakneck growth has 
gobbled up most of the available sites for windmills, prompting government 
officials to promise more careful planning procedures. Opposition is also 
building in Denmark, forcing the government to rethink a wind-power subsidy 
program. 
All of this spells trouble for wind power, which relies heavily on government 
funding. "Lower-quality projects are mucking up the panorama," says James 
Stettler, a renewable energy analyst with Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in 
London. 
Finding the right balance between wind development and environmental care 
would go a long way toward assuaging public opposition -- notably in 
wind-rich but windmill-poor Britain and Ireland -- and toward avoiding 
California-like blackouts in Spain in the years to come. The danger is real, 
says Rafael Miranda, chairman of Spanish utility Endesa SA, who this month 
urged the government to ease restrictions on new investments in power plants 
or risk outages. 
One way forward can be seen in the hills of northern Navarra, at the 
installations of Energia Hidroelectrica de Navarra SA, a Spanish company that 
specializes in renewable energy. On a recent afternoon, EHN official Enrique 
Huidobro races his four-by-four past two huge trucks on a dusty track leading 
up to Alaiz, an 85-turbine park built in 1999. EHN's head of civil works, Mr. 
Huidobro is working overtime -- patching the land, clearing debris and 
replanting grass around the park's latest additions, 10 big 660-kilowatt 
turbines whose 23-meter-long blades whoosh over the landscape with barely a 
whisper. 
EHN is Spain's largest wind-park developer. The company has installed more 
than 600 megawatts of wind capacity in Spain over the past five years, mostly 
in Navarra. Its parks have won accolades from environmental groups and 
business leaders alike, and company-sponsored surveys show public approval 
ratings above 80%. One of its subsidiaries, Energias Eolicas Europeas, this 
spring landed the biggest-ever financing package in the wind sector: some 900 
million euros from five European banks to build 31 wind parks in Don 
Quixote's La Mancha in south-central Spain. 
"The extra costs from taking care of the environment aren't questioned here," 
says EHN's chief executive, Esteban Morras, seated beneath oil paintings of 
modern windmills in his office in Pamplona. "That's the most profitable 
investment there is in the long run." 
Mr. Morras isn't just paying lip service to the green lobby. A former 
attorney and civil servant, he spent years working on water-resource and 
energy issues in the governments of his hometown and, later, the region. So 
when EHN was founded in 1989 and he became CEO, he was merely taking his 
passion to the private sector. 
Fresh from his morning English lesson -- EHN is expanding into the U.S., 
Eastern Europe and Latin America -- Mr. Morras outlines what he sees as the 
keys to making wind power palatable: careful planning, environmental 
sensitivity and the latest in technology. Then he grabs a pair of binoculars 
and peers out the window behind his desk. On the crest of a hill in the 
distance is EHN's newest prototype, a 1.3-megawatt turbine. It's 10 times 
bigger than the turbines first installed in southern Spain, yet its 
27-meter-long blades spin in much gentler breezes. 
"With more machines like that," Mr. Morras says, "we'll have parks that are 
less cluttered -- and more reliable and economical." 
The company's success owes a lot to the region's government. Navarra helped 
create EHN and still owns 48% of it. Navarra also approved generous tax 
credits for companies that invest in renewable-energy projects and 
established coherent and far-reaching planning procedures for wind power 
across the region. The strategy transformed the region from an also-ran in 
wind power to a model of development in five years 
Sitting in an office overlooking Navarra's first wind park, the regional 
official who guides the program reflects on the strategy. "It's not just 
about megawatts," says Nuria Iturriagagoitia, Navarra's director of industry, 
trade, labor and tourism. "You have to consider how it affects employment, 
education, agriculture, even tourism. The key was having a clear idea from 
the beginning on how to promote and implement alternative energies. EHN is 
the vehicle of our energy policy." 
She ticks off details of the 1995 energy plan. "The government studied 72 
sites across Navarra," she says, sketching a map of the shield-shaped region 
on a piece of paper. "It ruled out 43 of them: They were virgin territory, or 
too close to natural parks, even though they were some of the best, windiest 
sites," she explains, crossing out huge swaths of the hilly province. 
In the end, 16 sites made the cut. But Navarra's strategy for quelling 
opposition didn't end there. After EHN began its detailed planning, Mr. 
Morras held weekly public meetings with environmentalists, developers and 
local residents. "We discussed every curve of every road," he says. 
"Everybody was included." 
EHN, unlike many Spanish wind-park developers, also decided to have all its 
windmills assembled in local factories. Its new project in Castilla-La 
Mancha, for example, will be supplied by a newly built local Enron Corp. 
plant. 
The approach paid off. Today, all 16 sites have operational wind parks. Five 
years after the first turbines started spinning, some 35% of Navarra's 
electricity comes from wind power. That compares with about 2% for Spain as a 
whole, and 13% for Denmark, the world's fourth-largest wind-power producer. 
Having won over the citizens of Navarra, the regional government and EHN are 
now working to educate the whole country about wind power. They regularly bus 
students from across Spain to their wind parks, some of which have become 
tourist attractions. 
Compare this with the haphazard patchwork of windmills cropping up down south 
in Andalusia, home to one of the country's first wind parks -- the sprawling 
installation of low-power windmills planted in Tarifa in 1992. 
In 1997, wind-power developers presented some 65 projects to the regional 
government. But Andalusia had no overall plan for exploiting the region's 
wind-swept coasts and inland hilltops. The region had no plan to oversee 
wind-power development, and no uniform criteria for installing or removing 
windmills. In the end, about 20 wind parks were approved with little thought 
to how much total energy they would generate for the region or how they would 
cumulatively affect the environment. 
The result: Trucks and cranes have chewed up many pristine areas, leaving 
behind 45-meter-high towers and concrete-block substations. Yet wind power 
still generates less than 1% of Andalusia's electricity. 
Soledad Bonet, a spokeswoman for Andalusia's environmental department, 
acknowledges that the region has no global planning procedure for new energy 
installations, including wind parks. Although the region's departments of 
environment, labor and industry all review wind-park plans, individual 
municipal governments are essentially free to award development licenses as 
they see fit. 
The crosswinds of these forces can be seen on a hilltop west of Barbate, 
where Desarrollos Eolicos SA, the wind park unit of engineering firm Abengoa 
SA, is busy erecting a row of windmills. More than 20 towers are already in 
place, and neighbors worry the looming turbines and gouged-out access roads 
will create another Tarifa. "They might be `green' and all," says Antonio 
Aragon, a taxi driver who gets an eyeful every time he wheels out of town. 
"But they sure do foul up the landscape something awful." 
This is "third-world" development, says Jose Luis Tirado, a 47-year-old 
sculptor who heads of a local group of environmentalists, businessmen and 
landowners who oppose the wind park. "We've spent decades calling for 
alternative energy sources," he says. "But doing it like this -- without any 
sort of planning -- is worse than doing nothing at all." Equally galling, he 
says, is that none of the wind-park developers active in the region have 
shifted any production to local factories, despite Andalucia's jobless rate 
of more than 20%. 
Back in Barbate's town hall, Mayor de Jesus sits at his desk and recalls how 
he invoked building-permit irregularities to stop work on the wind park 
earlier this year. A few months later, though, a local judge overruled him, 
arguing that Abengoa stood to lose its investment and that Barbate would have 
had to reimburse the company for the cost of the whole project. Construction 
has begun again. Abengoa declines to comment. 
Now, Mr. de Jesus leafs through a dossier of proposed economic initiatives 
for his town, then sets it aside with a sigh. His legal battle to halt 
construction looks hopeless, as does his chance of winning a new accord that 
will allow local fishermen to cast their nets in Moroccan waters. 
Unemployment and drugs are slowly killing his town, he says. 
"Those turbines are being built -- there's nothing we can do about that," he 
says. "But that's it. We're passing a new urban plan this year. There won't 
be any more [wind-park] licenses in the future, not here."

Struggling Enron plant in India stops production 
By LAURA GOLDBERG 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Enron Corp.'s India power plant has stopped production after its sole 
customer stopped ordering electricity. 
The Maharashtra State Electricity Board had not issued dispatch instructions 
for power from the Dabhol Power Co. since early Tuesday, Enron spokesman John 
Ambler said Wednesday. 
The move by the board is the latest in a series of actions and counteractions 
surrounding the $3 billion project, in which Enron has a 65 percent stake. 
Though the plant can't produce power unless it has dispatch instructions, the 
plant hasn't been shut down. Employees are there and the plant reportedly is 
operational -- ready to produce power. 
The board told Enron last week it was canceling a 7-year-old power purchase 
agreement. Enron says the board doesn't have the right to do so. 
Under the contract, the board is supposed to pay Enron whether it takes power 
or not, said Carol Coale, an energy analyst with Prudential Securities in 
Houston. 
But the board has already refused to pay for power, saying Enron isn't living 
up to its contract. Enron, which says it is meeting the contract's terms, is 
owed about $64 million for power sold in December and January. 
Days before the board gave notice to Enron, the company started proceedings 
to end the contract because of unpaid power bills. But six months must pass 
before Enron can end it. 
There is continued speculation that Enron is looking to sell its stake in the 
project. In a statement, Enron said Wednesday it is "still open to 
constructive discussions on solutions." 
Indian officials also have been talking to some of the country's states about 
purchasing electricity from Dabhol, Bloomberg News reported Wednesday. 
The project has faced ongoing problems, almost from the time of Enron's 
initial investment in it in the early 1990s. 




BP Doesn't Expect Lead Role In Saudi Gas Proj - Source

DUBAI -(Dow Jones)- BP Plc (BP) doesn't expect to be awarded the lead role in 
Saudi Arabia's South Ghawar gas project, a source at the company told Dow 
Jones Newswires Thursday, requesting anonymity. 
Two weeks ago, Saudi Arabia announced its selection of international oil 
companies to develop three gas projects together, estimated to require 
investment of $25 billion-$30 billion.
BP was selected, along with Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch/Shell Group 
(RD), and Phillips Petroleum Co. (P), to develop the South Ghawar field, also 
known as Core Venture 1. Analysts estimate Core Venture 1 will need initial 
investment of between $15 billion and $17 billion. 
Industry sources have said that ExxonMobil and Shell are the strongest 
contenders to lead the project. 
The BP source said the leader of Core Venture 1 will get a 35% stake, 
Phillips a 15% stake, and the other two partners, 25% each. 
ExxonMobil has been appointed leader of Core Venture 2, or the Red Sea 
project, with a joint bid by Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) and Enron Corp. 
(ENE) securing a minority stake. 
Core Venture 3, the Shaybah project, was awarded to a consortium of Shell, 
TotalFinaElf (TOT), and Conoco Inc. (COCA). 
Leaders for Core Ventures 1 and 3 have yet to be announced. 
Oil company executives are due to sign initial agreements Sunday.

Regulators want state trade-off for caps / Davis asked to give up control of 
power lines
Bernadette Tansey
Chronicle Staff Writer

05/31/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.1
(Copyright 2001)

California's testy relationship with federal energy regulators could turn 
into a showdown tomorrow, when state power officials must decide whether to 
surrender some control over the state's electricity market or risk losing 
limited price curbs that kicked in this week. 
In agreeing last month to set flexible caps to restrict price gouging during 
electricity shortages, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said the 
state and its utilities must agree to let an independent organization manage 
California's power transmission lines.
Under that setup, California would be one of a group of Western states 
sharing a linked transmission grid whose rates and access rules would be set 
by independent managers. 
It is part of the commission's drive to create regional electricity markets 
throughout the country and make it easier to trade power across state lines. 
The regional grids would be a prelude to the nationwide free market in 
electricity advocated by the Bush administration and power marketers like 
Enron. 
But California Assembly Democrats who have challenged the federal demand say 
the requirement could interfere with some of the state's homegrown solutions 
to its energy crisis, such as Gov. Gray Davis' proposal that the state buy 
and run transmission lines owned by Southern California Edison Co. 
"A lot of folks were wondering how those two things would interact and are 
they mutually exclusive," said Paul Hefner, an aide to Assembly Speaker 
Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. 
Other officials say the federal requirement is premature because no regional 
organization yet exists that California can join. 
Mike Florio, a board member of the California Independent System Operator, 
which manages the state's power grid, said California is already part of 
regional efforts to clear transmission bottlenecks and share surplus power. 
But Florio said no Western state will rush into a regional arrangement and 
surrender part of its authority without ensuring a good deal for its own 
consumers. 
"We certainly don't want to be forced into an entity where generators or 
power marketers get to dictate the terms," Florio said. "This has got to be a 
long courtship rather than a shotgun wedding." 
When federal regulators initiated the move toward regional transmission grids 
during the Clinton administration in 1999, participation was voluntary, said 
Gary Cohen, general counsel to the state Public Utilities Commission. 
But in its April 26 order, the federal energy commission made its offer of 
limited price relief contingent on a filing by June 1 from the Independent 
System Operator committing the state to a regional management plan. 
The PUC and the Assembly are challenging that requirement. If anything, Cohen 
said, the state needs to increase control over its energy system while it 
recovers from its disastrous debut into deregulation, rather than submit to a 
regional authority that would be overseen by the federal government. 
"This doesn't seem to be the time to be doing more experimenting," Cohen 
said. "We certainly have not been able to rely on FERC to look out for the 
interests of Californians." 
WAITING FOR STATE'S RESPONSE 
Curt Hebert, chairman of the federal commission, declined to say yesterday 
whether the government would immediately yank the soft price caps that went 
into effect this week if it found the ISO response unsatisfactory. 
"He said he didn't want to prejudge the case," said commission spokeswoman 
Tamara Young-Allen. "He will wait to see what California files." 
PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown said he would be willing to give up some state 
control of the grid in exchange for meaningful price controls. But, he said, 
the federal measures granted fell far short of what California needed. 
"Hell, those caps are pretty toothless as they are," Brown said. 
The price controls are in effect only during power shortages. The cap is the 
price offered by the least-efficient generating plant. And generators can 
challenge any federal ruling that they have exceeded the caps, by claiming 
high costs. 
The controls were in place for the first time yesterday, when the state 
declared a Stage 2 power emergency, meaning reserves fell below 5 percent of 
available capacity. 
Florio said state power managers' answer to the federal government will 
probably be that they are already doing within California much of what a 
regional transmission organization would do. 
ISO COULD PLAY A ROLE 
The ISO manages the grid to ensure that power gets to where it is needed in 
the state, the organization told federal regulators in January. The agency 
could represent California when a Western regional organization develops, it 
said. 
The governor declined to say yesterday what stand he would take on federal 
regulators' demand. 
"I'm of a mind to do something, but I still have to talk to my lawyers," 
Davis said. 
Assembly Democrats say regulators in Washington have no right to withhold 
actions to correct California's dysfunctional power market. 
"They're required to . . . ensure that just and reasonable rates prevail in 
the market," Hefner said. "Why should we have to dicker to get them to do the 
job Congress created them to do?"

Plan would have biggest customers pay Edison's debt
Greg Lucas
Sacramento Bureau Chief

05/31/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.5
(Copyright 2001)

Legislative leaders are drafting a new rescue plan for Southern California 
Edison that would put the utility back on its feet financially at the expense 
of its biggest customers. 
The plan would leave manufacturers, refineries and other big industrial 
customers with the burden of paying nearly all the utility's $3.5 billion 
back debt through a dedicated charge. Residential and small commercial users 
would be on the hook for only a fraction of the back debt.
Big users say it is unfair to saddle them with all of Edison's debt, but 
supporters of the plan say it's these users that wanted deregulation and 
should shoulder the costs it created. 
"We're trying to put something together in a way that solves all these 
problems, and if people are to be pigheaded about it, we won't solve any 
problems," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek (Santa Cruz County). 
Although the plan is an alternative to Gov. Gray Davis' proposed deal to put 
Edison back on its feet financially, it could be used as a model to help 
restore Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to solvency. 
Democrats say the plan contains some elements desired by Republicans, but GOP 
lawmakers object to saddling large business users with Edison's debt. 
The plan is based on the way gas customers are divided into "core" and 
"noncore" users. 
SEPARATING 'CORE' USERS 
Under this proposal, electrical users would be divided the same way. Core 
users would be customers who use 500 kilowatts or less a month. Noncore would 
be those using more than 500 kilowatts. 
Out of Edison's 4.2 million customers, only 3,600 would be noncore customers. 
But those 3,600 customers use about 26 percent of Edison's demand for energy. 
Core customers would get their power from generators owned by Edison, 
long-term contracts and alternative energy producers, such as wind farms and 
solar panels, on contract with the utility. 
That would mean those customers would no longer be subject to the whims of 
the spot market, which has far higher prices than other sources of 
electricity. 
Large users, the noncore customers, would be given the right to negotiate to 
buy their power directly from generators or build on- site power plants to 
make themselves energy self-sufficient. 
The plan would be phased in through January 2003 to give large energy 
customers time to prepare for buying power on the open market. 
During that period, residential, small business and large industrial users 
would all share in paying off Edison's debt. But in 2003, that burden would 
shift exclusively to the big users. 
Republican lawmakers and those same large users have been clamoring to be 
given what is called "direct access" to generators so they can negotiate 
cheaper rates. 
Enron is also backing the idea of cutting loose the largest electricity users 
because that would create a built-in market for the energy the company sells. 
Large users who want to remain on the grid could do so. 
EDISON 'ENCOURAGED' 
Sources said Edison officials met with lawmakers over the weekend to iron out 
details of the plan. 
A spokesman for Edison said he was "encouraged" by the talks. 
"I haven't seen a finished product or a plan," said Bob Foster, a senior vice 
president with Edison. "They're approaching this in a spirit of goodwill and 
trying to find a solution." 
Big businesses complain that the plan does not work because right now, there 
is nowhere they can buy cheap electricity. 
"We're very concerned that separating the core from the noncore means we will 
experience extreme rate hikes over the next two years," said D.J. Smith, a 
lobbyist for the California Large Energy Consumers Association. 
"When you add blackouts, the multiple interruptions of production and another 
potentially huge rate hike, the result would be catastrophic to the economy," 
Smith said. 
Added Dorothy Rothrock, a lobbyist for the California Manufacturers and 
Technology Association: "What's the rationale for the noncore to be paying 
the entire Edison undercollection? It sounds to me like just pure politics. 
They don't want voters to pay because they vote." 
CONSUMER ADVOCATE SMELLS A RAT 
Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, 
said he thought the plan would eventually turn into a bailout as business 
interests muscle lawmakers into pushing some portion of Edison's debt onto 
residential and smaller commercial customers. 
"I think it's a trick. We've seen this same tactic used at the Public 
Utilities Commission, where what were supposed to be rate increases for big 
business end up costing more for residential and small businesses," 
Rosenfield said. 
The new plan also does not include the outright purchase of Edison's part of 
the transmission system that loops electricity around the state. 
Davis backs buying the lines for $2.7 billion. Democrats have insisted that 
for the state's financial help, taxpayers receive something of value. 
Republicans have insisted that they will back no proposal that includes state 
purchase of transmission lines. 
In the new proposal, the state would have a five-year option to buy the 
transmission lines for $1.2 billion -- the book value of the asset. 
In addition, the utility would make $1.5 billion available to the state to 
either purchase other assets -- such as Edison's hydroelectric facilities, 
for example -- or use it in partnership to build new power plants.

INDIA'S MSEB DOUBTFUL OVER DABHOL'S 10 PCT TARIFF CUT PROPOSAL

MUMBAI, May 31 Asia Pulse - The Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) 
has expressed serious doubts over Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company's (DPC) 
proposal to reduce its tariff by 10 per cent from the current average to Rs 
3.15 per unit. 
"Agreed that they have mooted such a proposal verbally, we should not forget 
that it is ridden with assumptions, which are unacceptable to the board," the 
MSEB sources told PTI here today.

India: Interest rate dichotomy growing wider

05/31/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MORE than 30 per cent of the targeted Government borrowings for the current 
year have been lifted from the market at pretty low yields. 
Over the last two months, the Reserve Bank of India seems to have managed 
short-term liquidity and interest rates to subserve the larger interest of 
making a success of the Centre's borrowing programme.
Over the last two years, the Government has been able to borrow cheap from 
the markets - a facility denied to other parts of the economy that have to 
borrow at stiff lending rates from the banks. 
Banks credit-rate borrowers and only the best get funds - this is perfectly 
logical. They also blindly put in funds into Government floats as they are 
totally risk-free, which again is perfectly sensible. 
Perhaps, in no part of the world is the practice of banking so risk-free as 
in Mera Bharat Mahan, with banks carrying NPAs of well over Rs 52,000 crore. 
The votaries of higher Government spending should not crib as the Centre's 
borrowing programmes have received a huge applause from the banking 
community. And the Centre promptly uses the funds on interest payments, 
defence and subsidies with capital investment getting to be negative. 
Allowing the private sector greater latitude has not curbed the scope of 
public sector capital investment. If it has not taken place, it is because 
even the Government is reluctant to set up power plants which have to offer 
free power to farmers. That is precisely why the private parties are 
insisting on escrow accounts. 
Over the planning period, public sector investment did not believe in 
cost-benefit principles as neck-high taxation levels and subsidies helped to 
hide the inefficiency. That is not possible today. In fact, higher savings of 
the Indian economy are being wasted more by the Government than by anybody 
else; also savings cannot be said to be acting as a restraint to the 
investment process. 
In the urban sector, there is an interest rate dichotomy with New Delhi 
getting easier funds than the corporate world. There is no premium on the 
interest rates for Government inefficiency. The same dichotomy prevails in 
the rural sector with bank funds flow tapering off and informal channels 
busy. Under Indian conditions, higher savings have nowhere to go, making the 
cut in contractual savings look sensible. 
It hurts not because interest rates are low but because there is no growth to 
absorb bank funds. 
At this point of time, one may not be able to find the tomes of any 
international economist to analyse the Indian economy. High savings, nil 
growth, steep Government borrowings and pervasive hunger and the rest cannot 
be reconciled into a neat econometric equation. 
Only growth can help. Sure we (our patriotic politicians and bureaucrats) 
allowed Enron to milk us. Today, if you are not a critic of Enron, you are 
bound to be dubbed a traitor. But can the Maharashtra State Electricity Board 
(MSEB) make money and get bank funds if has to provide power free to large 
sections of the public? Can it get some funds to revamp the existing plants? 
For us, there is progress in getting stuck at the Hindu growth rate of 3 per 
cent to getting stranded at the Orange growth rate of 6 per cent as breaking 
free is not in us.

India: Enron willing to continue project

Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 30. ENRON today updated Indian lenders about the status of the 
project and discussed ways for resolution of the current crisis. 
According to sources, Enron showed a willingness to continue with the project 
even after all the problems. Mr Wade Cline, Managing Director, is understood 
to have told the lenders that even though DPC had mentioned about taking a 10 
per cent cut on its returns, it would not do so unilaterally.
According to Mr Cline, the adjustments that Enron could make are contingent 
upon other parties too making an effort to make concessions. He made a 
presentation to the lenders about the current status of the project and the 
problems. 
Meanwhile, Dabhol Power Company today clarified that it has not "shut down" 
its plant. A spokesman said the plant continues to be "operational" as 
required by the power purchase agreement (PPA). He, however, confirmed that 
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) has not issued despatch 
instructions since 12 noon on May 29. 
He also said the company is "currently" not planning to terminate the PPA 
prior to the lapse of six months after the serving of the preliminary 
termination notice. 
Sources said that even though MSEB is not purchasing power from DPC, the 
company is not likely to default on its payments to lenders. This is because 
DPC has some money left from the disbursements of the first phase of the 
project. It can use the money to service its debt. It can, however, not 
transfer the amount to the second phase without the lenders' permission. 
The company also has a sizable amount of "completion equity" over and above 
the base equity to bring in if it chooses to continue construction. 
According to sources, the Indian lenders today wanted to know from Enron 
whether it is actually willing to stay back and complete the project or walk 
away. It appeared they are willing to stay, but only without conceding too 
much. 
Top MSEB officials said as far as MSEB is concerned, "DPC power may be 
available, but we would not take it. We are not recognising the PPA any 
more". They said the board had given the option to the company saying it 
would buy power and make payments according to the PPA but on an ad hoc 
basis. The adjustments could be made at a later date. 
"However, they threw it back to us saying you cannot have your cake and eat 
it too. So we decided to keep the cake," a State Government official said.

INDIA'S DABHOL SHUTS POWER PLANT, TO ISSUE TERMINATION NOTICE

05/31/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

MUMBAI, May 31 Asia Pulse - Amidst a rash of allegations and legal wrangles, 
the US energy major Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company (DPC) has shut down 
the US$3 billion Guhagar plant and is set to issue the Termination Notice to 
its partner the Maharashtra State Electricty Board (MSEB). 
With the MSEB not drawing power since last noon, the multinational had no 
option but to shut down the plant as MSEB is their sole customer, a member of 
the Godbole committee, set up for re-negotiating the power purchase agreement 
with the DPC, told PTI here Wednesday.
"DPC is reeling under tremendous pressure from its lenders who have already 
given the multinational a go-ahead for a wrap up by terminating the 
contract," he added. 
He said the Enron India chief, K Wade Cline, had conveyed DPC lenders' nod 
for the termination to the Committee members yesterday and had said "we will 
have to terminate the contract, if no solution is found to this grave crisis. 
As it is, even now DPC cannot see a way out". 
The DPC had served a Preliminary Termination Notice to MSEB on May 19. 
"Even though there exists a cushion period of six months, the energy major 
will issue the notice," the official said. 
On the other hand, MSEB officials are not worried over the termination of the 
contract. "MSEB has already rescinded the PPA. So even if they terminate the 
contract, it hardly matters to us," they said. 
Meanwhile, the Godbole committee would meet the MSEB officials on June six, 
but DPC representatives have not been invited for the same.

GE Plastics executive Jay Pomeroy knew familiarity with the Web was fast

with people from other regions and countries. We actually conducted a virtual 
meeting so that he would understand how to participate in meetings on-line." 
She added: "Before mentoring, you would never see Jay's name on a same-time 
chat. Now he is on a lot and he's become a pretty avid Internet user."
Call it reverse mentoring -- a form of one-on-one coaching that gives younger 
techies a chance to teach senior executives how to surf the Net, use instant 
messaging, collaborate with a team in real time, find new business 
applications, or explore the ins and outs of buying products on-line. 
It's a relationship that's also a two-way street: one that allows corporate 
greenhorns to seek advice from seasoned executives to help hone the 
managerial skills and relationships they need to advance in the workplace. 
Specialists say reverse mentoring is one way established companies like 
General Electric are embracing the Internet in order to survive -- and thrive 
-- in a technology-driven world. The practice, which began in Europe, is now 
taking hold in the United States as young workers bring newfound energy and 
skills to Old Economy companies once labelled slow-moving monoliths. 
Joel Kurtzman, co-author of a new book titled Radical E: From GE to Enron -- 
Lessons on How to Rule the Web, says the interchange between mentoring pairs 
is a form of cross-pollination: Students gain new knowledge; mentors gain 
valuable institutional information from veterans whose political astuteness 
and management savvy helped them succeed. 
Ms. Burkhart, for example, says the program helped her develop a relationship 
with Mr. Pomeroy, who returned the favour by providing tips on managing her 
career at GE. He also shared some of his institutional knowledge, and he 
remains a close contact at the firm. "We now have a relationship that has 
blossomed," said Ms. Burkhart. "It's also been good exposure for me." 
Glenn Rifkin, co-author of Radical E, says the trend is one of the more 
positive results of the dot-com boom. "For the first time, entrenched 
business people and companies have had their eyes opened to the fact that 
there are now some really smart young people in their corporate settings who 
can teach them new things," he said. 
The authors, who spent months interviewing mature companies with well-known 
brands, are convinced the future will be shaped by Old Economy "hybrids" -- 
companies that combine the best practices from e-commerce and older 
brick-and-mortar firms. This, they say, is a more radical form of reverse 
mentoring in which Net companies with little business knowledge are paired 
with established firms, or young employees at mature companies find new ways 
to do business on-line. 
Some of those companies include General Motors, Procter & Gamble, GE, and 
Houston-based Enron, a global energy company. GE, the first Old Economy firm 
to endorse and use reverse mentoring in the United States, began a formal 
program two years ago after chief executive officer Jack Welch introduced the 
concept. The company has since paired dozens of workers in a push to bring 
key people into the computer age and expand the company's market to include 
cyberspace. 
Procter & Gamble began encouraging IT employees to participate in an informal 
reverse mentoring program last year. "Because technology changes so rapidly, 
individuals pair up with people who seem to be more adept at the latest 
application," said P&G spokeswoman Vicky Mayer. 
Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, the Wharton School has implemented a program that 
helps top executives from around the world bring New Economy practices into 
Old Economy firms. One feature of the e-fellows program: Mentoring sessions 
staffed by MBA students in their 20s who share their knowledge with seasoned 
corporate leaders. 
Wharton e-fellows learn how to use the Internet to reshape their firms. Over 
the course of three weeks, e-fellows spend time at the business school's 
Philadelphia campus, in Silicon Valley, and at an international site. The 
program began in September. 
Executives are paired with MBA students in a one-on-one match. "Typically, 
these students are Internet savvy and they live in a world where e-business 
and business are synonymous," said Neil Neveras, director of e-business at 
Wharton's e-fellows program. 
Mary Dolan, a 37-year-old manager at Random House, was among the first 
Wharton e-fellows to participate in the program last year. 
"My background was more publishing driven than e-commerce driven," said Ms. 
Dolan, now director of e-book sales for the New York publisher. "The program 
gave me a broader grasp and view of the world at large, beyond the niche area 
of publishing." 
Ms. Dolan was paired with 27-year-old David Turrettino, then a first-year MBA 
student. Mr. Turrettino taught Ms. Dolan how to collaborate with her peers 
using Wharton's Net tools. Since the program is team-based, Ms. Dolan learned 
to conduct meetings on the Net and experiment with on-line business models. 
"This is a partnership between the generations," said Mr. Kurtzman, a global 
partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers. "But at the height of the dot-com boom, 
people were saying strategy is dead. . . . Now there is an understanding that 
you must have the business savvy that comes with experience." 
Mr. Pomeroy, of GE Plastics, says having a Web presence has paid off. "At GE 
Plastics we took a presence on the Web, which was about $10-million [U.S.] in 
sales revenues in 1998, and expanded it to $1.5-billion in business by 2000," 
he said. "This year, we expect to do close to $4-billion in business 
on-line." 
Mr. Pomeroy said Ms. Burkhart helped him use the Net with greater ease. 
"Now, everything we do is predicated on the internal or external Web," said 
Mr. Pomeroy. "Everything is on that square screen that sits on our desks."

Enron Willing To Continue India Power Project - Report

05/31/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- U.S. based power major Enron Corp. (ENE) may be 
willing to continue with its India project the Dabhol Power Co., Wade Cline, 
managing director of Enron's indian unit, told the projects Indian lenders, 
the Business Line newspaper reports Thursday. 
Cline told lenders that Dabhol Power could make adjustments, including a 10% 
cut in power tariffs, but it wouldn't do so unilaterally, the news report 
added. Any adjustments would depend on similar concessions from purchasing 
parties.
The $3-billion Dabhol Power project, India's biggest foreign investment 
project, is situated in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. 
The project, which will generate 2,184 megawatts of power when the second 
phase is completed later this year, is at the center of a power supply 
dispute between the state government of Maharashtra and Dabhol Power over 
what the government claims are "unaffordable" power tariffs. The dispute has 
unnerved foreign lenders. 
Tuesday, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board stopped buying power from 
the two-year-old Dabhol plant. The move came five days after the MSEB told 
DPC that it was canceling the 1995 Power Purchasing Agreement between the two 
parties that sets electricity prices. 
MSEB officials said Wednesday that the Dabhol plant has stopped producing 
electricity. 
The news report however quoted a Dabhol Power official as saying that while 
the MSEB had stopped dispatch instructions, the plant continued to be 
operational. 
MSEB was Dabhol's only buyer.

Stand up, Texas, against California's bullying 
By JONATHAN WILCOX 
LADIES and gentlemen: May I present to you the Hon. Bill Lockyer, attorney 
general of the state of California, from the May 22 Wall Street Journal: 
"I would love to personally escort (Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth) Lay to an 8 
x 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is 
Spike, honey.' " 
When you stop gagging, join me in celebrating Lockyer's crude, lewd and 
unsubdued behavior. It has stripped away whatever veneer of respectability 
California officials had by virtue of the offices they hold and exposed them 
as braggarts and bullies of the first order. But they also wield enormous and 
destructive power -- and they intend to use it. 
The sooner Texans realize this the better. 
As citizens of the state that is home to much of the nation's energy 
production, the people of Texas are intimately familiar with the booms and 
busts of the oil and natural gas industries. Sometimes, prices are high, new 
supply is nigh and willing buyers can only sigh. 
Other times, gluts occur, demand fluctuates, competition grows ruthless and 
revenues seep out like the last remnants of black crude from a stripper well. 
These are the principles of American capitalism, free market forces and the 
give-and-take and push-pull that separate this nation's economic capacity 
from all others. It is a fundamentally fair system, it has served us 
remarkably well and every time we have tampered with it, it has been to our 
ultimate detriment. 
Witness California's partial "deregulation" of its electricity market. 
The Golden State, for all its vanity, pride and preening machismo, actually 
knows very little of tough times. Sure, we can handle the occasional 
spectacular episode, like an earthquake or wildfire. That's part of the 
thrill of living in California. 
But when it comes to our economic expectations and their interrelationship 
with our desired lifestyle, we only know the California way: more, more often 
and with no end in sight. 
And if we don't get what we want, when we want it, it's someone else's fault. 
In that light, it is no surprise that we are saddled with our current 
governor, Gray Davis, and our current law enforcement chief, the 
aforementioned Lockyer. 
Despite his frequent jittery appearances on national television, Davis is a 
politically shrewd man. He may not know which public policy choices are best 
for the state's future, but that's not his highest priority. 
Item No. 1 on Davis' "To Do" list is to get re-elected next year. But this 
has been complicated by the state's year of energy woes, Davis' ineffectual 
response and the fact that California is a largely one-party state. 
Of California's eight statewide elected offices, seven are held by Democrats, 
including Davis and Lockyer. You don't have to be a Delphic oracle to discern 
that if Davis gets tossed out, he will take more than a few of his political 
brethren with him. 
So, as California tiptoes toward its long, hot summer of rolling blackouts 
and unprecedented electricity shortages, Davis is busy digging his personal 
bomb shelter. He's preparing for the big one, calculating that while the 
damage will be great, and the fallout potentially lethal, he and the other 
cockroaches, like Lockyer, will survive. 
How will they do this? By finding some fall guys to take the rap. 
Call it the Texas two-step: First, Davis declares "war" on Texas energy 
producers. Next, Lockyer says he expects to file civil charges against 
suppliers, with, he hopes, criminal counts to follow. 
For a demonstration of how not to deal with Lockyer and other California 
aggressors, examine the rejoinder of Mark Palmer, Enron's vice president for 
corporate communications. Lockyer's comment about Lay, he said, "is so 
counterproductive that it doesn't merit a response." 
Wrong. Weak. Ineffective. Decency in the face of demagoguery may be 
dignified, but it's little more than an invitation to further abuse and, for 
Enron, public villainy. 
Enron had a chance to do something corporations under hostile government fire 
only dream about: Embarrass, disarm and neutralize a corrupt public official 
out to smear their good name. 
By challenging Lockyer to either reassess or renounce his remarks, Enron 
could have injected common sense and rare truth into a debate that has become 
twisted and warped by the tirades of California officials. Best of all, Enron 
could have extracted the kind of retraction that would have adorned Lockyer 
with the scarlet "A" of contrite politicians: apology. 
Lockyer and other state officials may not yet know the ceiling of scorn Enron 
will tolerate from them. But they surely know the floor: Joking with 
journalists of the pleasure they would take from the arranged assault of 
Kennth Lay in a California prison.

Markets / Your Money Senate Shift to Ripple Across Industries Politics: 
Jeffords' decision could broadly affect range of sectors, from drugs and HMOs 
to tobacco and energy.

The expected defection of Sen. James M. Jeffords of Vermont from the 
Republican Party could markedly affect the drug, HMO, defense, credit card 
and tobacco industries, money managers and investment analysts said 
Wednesday. 
"I don't see any upside for the [stock] market. This looks like gridlock of 
the worst possible kind," John Carey, manager of the Pioneer Fund, said of 
the switch, which would give the Democrats control of the Senate for the 
first time since 1995 and increase their ability to slow President Bush's 
legislative agenda.
"The market was beginning to feel confident that the regulatory burden on 
business would ease," he added, "and there was even hope for 
business-friendly legislation. But no longer." 
Analysts said the clearest winners in a switch to a Democratic Senate could 
be lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose status as government-sponsored 
enterprises is expected to remain intact. Both stocks were up strongly 
Wednesday despite a weak market. 
Still, most analysts said it's unlikely that a change in the balance of 
congressional power would lead to what Carey termed "radical anti-business 
legislation." And President Bush's income tax cut, passed by both houses and 
headed for a conference committee, also is expected to remain intact. 
"But I wouldn't expect another tax cut next year, not anymore," said Greg 
Valliere, chief political analyst in Charles Schwab's Washington Research 
Group. "The Jeffords defection, if it happens, doesn't mean the Bush agenda 
is in tatters. It does mean gridlock for a lot of businesses." 
Here's how some major industries could be affected: 
* Drug makers 
A Democratic Senate could produce a public relations nightmare for the 
pharmaceutical industry, already under scrutiny over the pricing of some 
medications. 
"They can apply more heat to the pharmaceutical industry and inflame issues, 
such as [supposedly] charging too much for drugs," said Tom Miller, a policy 
analyst with Cato Institute, a conservative think tank. 
"There's a headline risk. You know, 'Ted Kennedy Holding Hearings on Drug 
Companies,' " added Valliere. Kennedy (D-Mass.) is in line to be chairman of 
the Senate Health Committee. 
Analysts said such tactics aren't likely to result in legislation, given 
Republican control of the House. 
Still, Andy Laperriere, a political economist at International Strategy & 
Investment Group in Washington, said Democratic Senate control at least would 
revive the "potential threat of price controls in some form." 
* HMOs 
Those stocks were hard hit Wednesday, perhaps as investors envisioned 
industry critic Kennedy shaping a so-called patient's bill of rights or 
Medicare reform. 
Still, a power shift could work in Bush's favor if Kennedy and fellow 
Democrats were to block administration health-care proposals at every turn, 
said Alan Skrainka, chief market strategist at brokerage Edward Jones. The 
GOP could end up gaining seats in the midterm election next year, he said, by 
campaigning against stonewallers. 
* Defense and aerospace 
Most analysts said the expected shift would probably have little impact on 
the defense industry, even if the leadership changes in the key committees 
such as Armed Services and Appropriations, since both sides of the aisle 
agree on the need for more defense spending. 
But debate over already contentious issues such as missile defense and 
whether to restart production on the B-2 Stealth bomber could intensify. 
"These would be bones of contention anyway but maybe more so with the 
Democrats' added power in the Senate," said Paul H. Nisbet, analyst with JSA 
Partners. 
Some analysts said defense stocks have run up since last summer on hopes of 
increased spending, perhaps leaving them vulnerable. 
* Credit card issuers 
The bankruptcy reform bill approved by both houses, considered a boon for 
major credit card issuers like MBNA and Bank One, could be watered down or 
even killed, Laperriere said. 
* Energy 
Some money managers suggested environmental restrictions pushed by emboldened 
Democrats could hinder a variety of energy companies. 
"This news is good for the caribou, that's about it," said Pioneer's Carey, 
referring to the chances that a Democratic Senate could block efforts to 
drill for oil in sensitive arctic areas. "They can breathe easier." 
But a Senate shift might not hurt energy companies as much as some expect, 
analysts said. If the Democrats use their Senate control to block elements of 
the president's new energy plan, it could be a plus for wholesale power 
merchants and traders such as Enron, Reliant Energy and Duke Energy, said 
Merrill Lynch analyst Donato J. Eassey. 
"With gridlock you're going to have uncertainty, and uncertainty causes 
volatility, which is good for [traders]," Eassey said. 
Bush's plan to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to limited oil and 
gas exploration was politically dicey even before the possible Senate change, 
several analysts said. 
The majority of oil field services firms might actually do better if the 
Alaskan proposal failed, according to analyst Poe Fratt of A.G. Edwards. Only 
a handful of such companies stand to benefit from development of the wildlife 
refuge tract, he said. 
If exploration is blocked there, "more companies will benefit from drilling 
elsewhere," he said. 
* Tobacco 
Huge jury verdicts against cigarette makers in recent years "really started 
when industry executives got dragged before the Senate," Laperriere said, so 
tobacco companies wouldn't look forward to another round of hearings. He 
called new hearings "a real possibility" if the Democrats are running the 
Senate. 
* Fannie and Freddie 
Laperriere said the threat of policy changes that would affect regulation of 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would be diminished under a Democratic Senate. 
He noted that instead of Phil Gramm (R-Texas) leading the Senate Banking 
Committee, it would be led by Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), a major supporter of 
the popular lending agencies. 
* Telecommunications 
Some analysts said chances for deregulation--for example, allowing the Baby 
Bells fully into the long-distance market--won't survive a power shift in the 
Senate. 
"There was hope that the Telecommunications Act, which has actually impeded 
competition, might be revisited," Carey said. "If this [Jeffords situation] 
is bad news for any industry, it's telecom." 
But several analysts and investors said the market impact of the Jeffords 
defection already has been overblown. "The biggest thing we needed from this 
administration was the tax cut, and it looks like we're getting it," said 
Robert Nichols, chairman of Windward Capital Management in Los Angeles.

Brazil asking power users to cut back 
Officials want to pare consumption by a fifth 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle News Services 
SAO PAULO, Brazil -- The towering offices of Banco Itau and Microsoft Corp. 
in Brazil's financial heartland greeted nightfall with their trademark lights 
turned off. 
Store owners celebrated astronomic weekend sales of energy-saving lamps. 
That's good news as the government asks the nation to chop 20 percent off 
energy consumption to avoid widespread blackouts and to haul South America's 
biggest country and economy out of a chronic power shortage sparked by 
drought. 
"We are in the hands of the public. If people manage to economize 20 percent, 
the likelihood of blackouts will be very small," said Mauro Arce, Sao Paulo 
State energy secretary and member of an anti-crisis task force. 
The plan to stave off California-style electricity cuts has borne encouraging 
results so far. The program asks consumers, companies and industry to cut 
electricity use by 15 percent to 25 percent, with the threat of price 
surcharges of 50 percent to 200 percent. But it will come at a cost. 
Economists fear rationing and its consequences could knock Brazil's economic 
growth to less than 3 percent from expectations of 4 to 4.5 percent. 
Government officials only say it will slow the economy but will not predict 
how much. 
And it may trigger moves by the government to encourage the aggressive power 
plant program that has long been needed. Power plant builders, including 
companies with big presences in Houston, have delayed plans to build plants 
because they fear losses from the risk from local currency devaluations. 
Rationing officially begins June 1 across most of Brazil, although its 
biggest cities have already dimmed street lighting, and consumers have turned 
to candles. 
The government estimates it needs to expand the country's generation capacity 
by 50 percent, or 31,000 megawatts, by 2008 at a cost of about 33 billion 
reais, or $14 billion. 
Brazil's power shortage has been hidden over the years by overuse of 
reservoirs. The government increased generation in years with good rain by 
failing to let the reservoirs fill to capacity. Hydroelectric power is 
responsible for about 85 percent of Brazil's generation capacity. 
"In the last 40 years there have been plenty of droughts, but we've never 
been forced to ration energy," said Lido Luis Sauer, an energy-studies 
professor at the University of Sao Paulo. 
Reservoirs, the professors said, were often allowed to fill only to 70 
percent of capacity. Reduced rainfall has cut the reservoir levels to as low 
as 30 percent. 
"We're on the verge of trying to generate power with mud," Sauer said. "We've 
been warning them for years that this risk exists, but they told us `don't 
panic.' " 
For now, the power grid here depends on the weather and the cooperation of 
the public. 
If water levels fall farther, the country may need to cut up to 40 percent of 
consumption, Arce said. Rationing is set to last through November, when the 
rainy season resumes. 
With cooperation and the weather on its side, the energy task force will just 
need some understanding from the public. 
In an early sign of irritation, Sao Paulo Internet company ATN Internet filed 
a lawsuit seeking a judicial ban on power cuts. And Supreme Court President 
Marco Aurelio Mello said some of the government's measures violated the 
constitution. 
"Unfortunately, the filing of injunctions and lawsuits has become a national 
sport," said Pedro Parente, head of the task force. "The situation today is 
serious. We need this to be understood by the judiciary." 
If the public cooperates, Parente said the government could relax some of its 
rationing measures. The task force had banned energy contracts for new 
commercial or industrial projects. 
Brazil's government realizes it has to end the drought in power plant 
construction and is considering a program to protect some electricity 
utilities from currency risk to attract the $14 billion it needs for new 
power plants. 
Companies such as AES Corp., Duke Energy Corp. and El Paso Energy Corp. have 
delayed or limited expected investment in natural gas-fired generation plants 
on concern that government rules limit their ability to pass along increases 
in dollar-denominated fuel costs to electricity consumers who are billed in 
reais, the local currency. 
Devaluations cut the revenues of the power plant builders, but not their 
expenses. 
"The government hasn't had a policy to attract investment to generation," 
said Frank McGann, an oil analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co. in New York. "An 
adjustment in gas prices is a major step forward, which should have been 
taken two years ago." 
The failure to build plants has come despite natural gas supplies piped in 
from Bolivia, Argentina and fields of Brazil's Atlantic coast and a national 
"emergency plan" to encourage the building of dozens of new plants to make up 
the shortfall. 
A new natural gas supply contract with power producers may spur some 
much-needed construction. 
Under the currency guarantee proposal, which could be adopted as government 
policy as early as this week, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, the state-controlled 
oil company, which is the lead investor in the country's major pipelines, 
would sell gas to generators under a one-year contract with a fixed price in 
reais, said Energy Minister Jose Jorge de Vasconcelos Lima. 
If the dollar price of gas rose during the contract, Petrobras would charge 
the difference to a special account. The generator would pay off that 
account, plus interest and Brazilian inflation, by including them as part of 
the next one-year, fixed price contract at the same time that the government 
raises consumer power rates, a spokeswoman for the Energy Ministry said. 
A utility now has to pay Petrobras and other distributors the market rate, 
but is limited in the amount of the increase it can pass on to consumers. 
With rationing likely to raise distributors' costs -- slashing profits more 
-- these companies are reluctant to invest in any new venture, including 
generation. 
"It has never been decided who will pay for foreign exchange losses in the 
gas contracts," said Luiz Maurer, vice president for the Brazilian 
association of energy trading companies, as well as head of regulatory 
matters for Enron in Latin America. 
Enron, for its part, is moving ahead with plans to build about 800 megawatts 
of new generation capacity. The move, as well as plans by Petrobras to become 
a minority investor in a series of gas-fired plants, is a direct result of 
the same problem. 
With other companies holding back on generation projects, Enron and other gas 
distributors need a market for their natural gas. AES said recently it may 
cancel $240 million in investments in three plants. 
"If we don't build plants or help others build them, we will be in an even 
worse situation," said Ron Vaz Moreira, chief financial officer of Petrobras. 
"We won't have any market for our gas." 






California Official Cites Evidence of Electricity Price Manipulation

California

Reporter (TM)

An investigation into electricity prices has turned up evidence that 
generators are throttling their power plants up and down to drive up prices, 
according to California's top utility regulator. 
Loretta Lynch, president of the state Public Utilities Commission, said 
Wednesday that an investigation started last year to examine electricity 
prices, and which later turned to examine unprecedented numbers of power 
plant outages, has found instances where generating units were backed down 
until electricity emergencies were declared and then brought back up in such 
a way as to maximize profits.
"What we saw was a pattern of individual behavior," Lynch said. 
Generators acknowledge that they vary the output from their power plants, but 
say they do so for legitimate business reasons. Included among those reasons 
is a little-known tactic to insure themselves against breakdowns that would 
be limited under a federal order that is to take effect next week. 
Although Lynch would not reveal more specifics, her comments, which echoed 
revelations she made before a state Senate committee last week in Southern 
California, come as accusations, legal threats and rhetoric are all swirling 
to a boil. 
Earlier this week, Attorney General Bill Lockyer, whose office is working 
with the PUC in one of several ongoing electricity market investigations, 
reportedly said that he wanted to escort Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay to 
a prison cell "that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my 
name is Spike, honey."' 
The heated rhetoric and continuing legal threats have infuriated generators, 
who continue to trot out figures showing that they are running power plants 
harder than ever. 
"There's nothing that gets under our skins more than somebody --some 
government official -- who is ill-informed making those judgments," said Tom 
Williams, a spokesman for Duke Energy, a North Carolina-based company that 
owns three major power plants in California and is building a fourth. 
Duke generated 50 percent more electricity from those plants last year than 
it did the previous year, Williams said. And the company is on track to 
generate even more this year, he added. 
But Lynch and other state leaders are becoming increasingly hostile in their 
remarks about the half- dozen out-of-state power companies that bought 
utility-owned power plants in 1998 and 1999 as the state moved to restructure 
the electricity industry. 
Lynch said state regulators are at least a month away from taking legal 
action, but she also said that in addition to looking at power plant outages, 
the investigation was looking at patterns in the way power plants are run, 
allegedly to influence prices and then capitalize on them. 
"There are several ways the generators game the system," she said. 
The companies acknowledge they might limit output because of environmental 
restrictions and in situations where the cost of running a plant is higher 
than the price they could get for electricity at a given point in time. 
But there is another reason, too. It is a practice that has troubling 
implications because it sets up a situation where the higher prices go, the 
more incentive companies have to hold back power. 
Documents filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission show that some 
companies ease off their units' throttles in order to insure themselves 
against the possibility of a breakdown at another unit. Their logic is this: 
Energy companies typically sell electricity in advance, so they have an 
obligation to provide that electricity to their buyers. If they are running 
at 100 percent capacity and a unit breaks down, the company has to scramble 
to buy electricity at high, last-minute prices in order to meet its 
contractual obligations. 
Last summer, for example, a large, 750-megawatt unit at Duke's Moss Landing 
power plant broke down, and Duke found itself spending $1.2 million an hour 
to meet its contracts. 
By holding some of their power-generating capacity in reserve, the companies 
can insure themselves against a breakdown somewhere else. And the higher 
prices go, the more insurance they might want to keep. 
"That is a rationale they are using," said PUC energy division director Paul 
Clanon. 
Duke, Mirant Corp. and Pacific Gas & Electric were among the companies who 
objected to a draft order from federal regulators that would put an end to 
the practice of withholding power from the spot-market to cover the 
possibility of a breakdown. 
In papers that Mirant filed with FERC, the Atlanta-based generator said that 
if its ability to withhold power in that way was restricted, then regulators 
should allow the company to charge even more for its electricity. 
But FERC shot that argument down, saying that although it is reasonable for a 
company to not sell all of its electricity ahead of time, there is no reason 
to hold back power from the hour-to-hour spot market, as Mirant wanted to do. 
The federal commission said that, contrary to Mirant's claims, "the generator 
faces no financial risk" if it is forced to sell all its available power on 
the spot market.

Shrugging off energy ties / GOP gubernatorial hopeful downplays his Texas 
investments
Carla Marinucci
Chronicle Political Writer

05/24/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.3
(Copyright 2001)

Wealthy GOP gubernatorial hopeful Bill Simon Jr., on a campaign stop 
addressing California's power crunch yesterday, kicked off his own personal 
energy crisis when he confided to an energy executive, "I'm an oil and gas 
man from way back." 
Simon, son of the late Nixon Treasury Secretary William E. Simon, later 
insisted that he misspoke.
But in his first open campaigning in Northern California, the Los Angeles 
businessman and philanthropist acknowledged both energy investments and his 
role as a former board member of Houston's Hanover Compressor Co. The 
publicly traded energy-related firm is a market leader in natural gas 
compression and counts among its partners the Texas energy giant Enron. 
Simon, who has also invested in educational technologies, Internet firms and, 
most recently, South of Market real estate in San Francisco, stressed 
yesterday that stocks in energy-related firms are only a small part of his 
portfolio. 
But ties to a Texas energy firm could negatively affect his first run for 
public office in California. A Field Poll released this week showed an 
increasing number of Californians holding energy firms responsible for power 
shortages. 
And, as President Bush prepares to visit the state next week, Texas oil and 
gas firms have specifically been the target of Gov. Gray Davis, who asserts 
that their hunger for profits accounts for the crisis. 
Hanover Compressor, traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol 
HC, has 2,700 employees and had an estimated worth of $2.6 billion on April 
30, according to a recent financial report. 
A 1996 report in Oil and Gas Investor magazine described Hanover as a 
fast-growing, profitable innovator in technologies to compress and transport 
natural gas. The firm signed a $130 million deal with Enron Capital and Trade 
Corporation in 1995, according to the magazine. 
Yesterday, Simon insisted that he is not strongly tied to the firm, and said 
that if he runs, he will release financial statements showing his holdings. 
"I'm not an oil and gas man," Simon told The Chronicle. "Speaking loosely, I 
said I have experience in looking at oil and gas investment opportunities. 
"I was one of a group. I was on the board for a little bit," he said of his 
relation to Hanover. "I still have a small piece. . . . We still have some 
ownership of it . . . (but) I'm not active, never really was." 
The focus on Simon's energy holdings came as the prospective candidate toured 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
Simon also heard presentations -- and pitches for venture capital - - from 
two energy executives: Rick Jeter, who heads X.L. Operating, a Fort Worth, 
Texas, oil and gas producer; and Steve Doyle, chief executive of Clean Energy 
Systems. As Simon met with them after their presentations, his greeting to 
Doyle, overheard by reporters, was, "I'm an oil and gas man from way back." 
"Hanover Compression was one company that we started 10 years ago now," he 
explained to reporters. "It promotes the efficient use of gas. It helps it 
come out of the ground. It helps it be transported. It's good technology. 
"We have to continue to focus on these kinds of energy efficiencies," he 
said. "This is our way out, ultimately, of the energy crisis." 
Asked the extent of his financial interest in that and other energy-related 
firms, Simon could not provide specifics. "I'd have to get you those 
numbers," he said. 
But he said, "We've looked at a broad variety of opportunities in virtually 
every industry in the country. Oil and gas is one. . . . I'm not specific to 
this industry. I'm an eclectic investor." 
On energy issues, Simon said he would be "willing to look at" expanding oil 
drilling in California, though he said he was opposed to offshore drilling. 
He said he could support "temporary" price caps on the wholesale costs of 
energy, but insisted any details would require more study. "You have to know 
how urgent the problem is with respect to the supply and balance," he said. 
Asked if Davis has been fair in criticizing Texas firms, Simon said, "I think 
he ought to quit pointing fingers and start focusing on solutions." 
But he said he did not yet have a detailed energy plan, adding, "We're 
putting it together right now." 
Simon, 50, said he expects to make his announcement about a gubernatorial run 
the first week in June. 
He told potential volunteers yesterday he would be a "major investor" in his 
campaign, but would also raise funds for the estimated $40 million to $60 
million needed in a gubernatorial race. 
Simon said he is exploring his first political run because "I'm always 
interested in being of service. I think here's a place I could be of some 
help." 
But "the reason I'd like to seek the office of governor, as opposed to 
controller or even run for the Assembly, is that's where we have to focus our 
attention," he said. "If you have a weak top of the ticket, you have less of 
a chance at being elected further down on the ticket. Normally, I'm just 
working my way up, paying my dues, but in this situation, I don't know we 
have that option."

India Appoints Nominee To Dabhol Power Dispute Panel

05/24/2001
Dow Jones Asian Equities Report
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

BOMBAY -(Dow Jones)- The Indian government Thursday announced measures, 
including the appointment of a retired senior official as its nominee on the 
negotiating panel that is sitting with Enron India Pvt. Ltd., to resolve the 
Dabhol power supply dispute. 
Retired Telecom Secretary A.V. Gokak has been appointed as the government's 
nominee on the negotiating panel - set up by the state government of 
Maharashtra - that's made up of state and federal government officials and 
officers of Maharashtra State Electricity Board, or MSEB.
The long-standing dispute is over power tariffs on electricity generated from 
a plant of the Dabhol Power Co., the Indian unit of U.S.-based Enron Corp. 
(ENE). The plant that will generate 1,444 megawatts of power when the second 
phase is completed later this year is India's biggest foreign investment to 
date at $3 billion. 
In a further move Thursday, New Delhi has set up a committee of senior 
officers from various ministries to examine any proposals that might emerge 
from the negotiating panel. 
The panel was set up after last month's delivery to Maharashtra government of 
the Godbole Report, a 198-page document prepared by a five-member team headed 
by former federal home secretary, Madhav Godbole. 
A key recommendation of the report included the renegotiation of a power 
purchase agreement between the Dabhol Power Co. and the MSEB. 
The negotiating panel was due to meet Wednesday for a second round of talks 
with senior executives of the DPC but was cancelled after Godbole resigned 
over criticism levelled by leader of the National Congress Party Sharad Pawar 
that implied the panel had negative attitudes. Godbole subsequently withdrew 
his resignation. 
A further meeting has been scheduled Tuesday. 
Meanwhile, federal Minister of Power Suresh Prabhu confirmed Thursday that 
the Indian government is ready to consider any worthwhile idea emerging from 
the negotiating panel.

INDIA: New Delhi aims to help Enron patch up with utility.

05/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 24 (Reuters) - India's federal government will help Enron Corp 
and Maharashtra state resolve their wrangle over the U.S. energy giant's 
troubled $2.9-billion power project, an official statement said on Thursday. 
Dabhol Power Co, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) have been embroiled in a dispute over payments for 
six months.
The dispute provoked the Houston-based Enron Corp to issue a preliminary 
notice last week to terminate its contract to sell power to the utility. 
"The government of India will assist in the implementation of any agreed 
proposals, which have the support of the concerned parties," the statement 
said. 
The federal government has nominated a representative in the state's panel 
negotiating with Enron. 
Another committee of senior officials has been set up in New Delhi to assess 
the outcome of the negotiations, the statement said. 
"The (junior) power minister, Suresh Prabhu, has confirmed that the 
government of India is ready to consider any worthwhile idea emerging out of 
the negotiating committee for the settlement of the dispute." 
The statement said the federal government wanted the state to resolve the 
dispute. 
"The government of India is of the view that a quick settlement of the 
dispute is essential for the power sector of Maharashtra." 
The 2,184-MW power project was regarded as a test case of India's plans to 
encourage private investment in the power sector. 
The first phase of 740 MW of the project is up and running, while the second 
phase of 1,444 MW is slated to be completed next month.

POLAND: ANALYSIS-Central European gas markets head for shake-up.
By Marta Karpinska

05/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

WARSAW, May 24 (Reuters) - Central Europe's gas market is heading for a 
shake-up as Poland nears the go-ahead for a disputed transit pipeline and the 
neighbouring Slovak and Czech republics launch key sector sell-offs, analysts 
say. 
The Polish government plans to examine an industry-backed proposal for a gas 
link connecting Belarus and Slovakia-based transit systems which would carry 
fresh Russian supplies to western Europe.
"The recommended route is not the worst possible, and I do not rule out that 
the cabinet will approve it, although we may need some small adjustments," 
Economy Minister Janusz Steinhoff told reporters on Wednesday. 
Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who arrives later on Thursday in 
Warsaw for a three-day visit, is due to meet Economy Ministry officials and 
is expected to try to talk up the Russia-favoured pipeline project. 
The decision - which could terminate an alternative plan by Russia's giant 
Gazprom to lay a more pricey pipeline along the bed of the Baltic Sea - may 
affect a key gas sell-off pending in neighbouring Slovakia, analysts said. 
"Gazprom is very interested in the region, particularly in the Slovak transit 
system, but its decision will partly depend on whether the new transit will 
run across Poland," said Evgeny Solovyov, sector analyst at SG Securities in 
London. 
SLOVAK TRUMP CARD 
Analysts say the sale of the Slovak SPP gas group, including a powerful and 
highly lucrative gas transit system, is sure to attract heavy investor 
interest and become the largest ever sale in the country. 
"The national businesses in central Europe are all like individual pieces of 
one puzzle, and Slovakia's SPP is the most important piece of that picture," 
said Bidzina Bejuashvili, oil and gas analyst at Raiffeisen Zentralbank in 
London. 
Last year SPP shipped almost 90 billion cubic metres (bcm) of Russian natural 
gas to western Europe, making Slovakia the top cross-region gas transit 
route. 
The state wants to sell 49 percent of SPP - also a gas distribution and 
transportation monopoly - all of which will likely go to a strategic 
investor. A rough price tag put by analysts on the entire SPP varies from $2 
billion to $8 billion. 
So far, Gazprom and a consortium of Ruhrgas, Gaz de France PR and Italy's 
Snam - a gas distribution arm of Eni - have expressed interest in acquiring 
the stake. 
Germany's RWE Gas and Wintershall have also said recently they would jointly 
bid for the gas group. 
The German consortium said it would bid too for SPP's neighbour, Czech gas 
import monopoly Transgas, which the government wants to sell with eight gas 
distributors, in a sale which attracted 14 preliminary bids earlier this 
week. 
"Czech and Slovak national markets are simply too small, and whoever pursues 
the respective gas assets is likely to be looking for their transit pipelines 
connecting Russian supplies and western consumers," said Bejuashvili. 
POLISH LINK 
Analysts say that Gazprom, Snam, Gaz de France, as well as Ruhrgas and 
Wintershall - all involved in a consortium to build the Polish transit link - 
will likely be the frontrunners in the regional gas asset acquisitions. 
The consortium is now carrying out a feasibility study on a powerful transit 
pipeline route running mostly along Poland's eastern border, but avoiding 
most of its eastern national parks, due to link Belarussian and Slovak 
pipelines. 
Poland had initially opposed the transit project fearing the new volumes 
would be complemented with Russian gas from the pipelines of its strategic 
ally, Ukraine. But it has surrendered to pressure from both its commercial 
partners and the European Union - which it is negotiating to join. 
The government had hoped the new pipeline, likely to replace a previously 
planned second stretch of the existing east-west Yamal pipeline running 
across Poland, would be used to supply some Russian gas imports to its 
industrial southwest. 
The Yamal pipeline, which now has a capacity of 18 billion cubic metres (bcm) 
per year, needs $350 million for three compressor stations to boost its 
capacity to a planned 32 bcm. 
POLISH POTENTIAL 
Analysts said that Poland's 39-million-consumer market and relatively low gas 
usage - only 8.5 percent of total primary fuel consumption - make the 
domestic gas market growth potential much higher than that of its neighbours. 
"It is quite reasonable to assume that Polish gas consumption will grow at a 
faster pace than its economic growth in coming years," said Solovyov. 
Poland's gas monopoly PGNiG expects last year's consumption of 10.9 bcm to 
grow by five percent per year over the next three years to reach almost 13 
bcm by 2003. 
The government's long-range forecast - which a lot of analysts say is too 
high - sees annual gas consumption up to 18.4 billion cubic metres by 2010. 
In a highly disputed plan the Polish government wants to sign a long-term 
agreement with Norway later this year which would enable it to diversify from 
its currently mainly Russian gas supplies, and boost import volumes by 5 bcm 
as of 2007. 
"There is absolutely no guarantee the consumption will grow as expected, and 
signing a new long-term contract may result in PGNiG being highly 
overcontracted," the head of Enron Polska, Jaroslaw Astramowicz, told a 
recent industry seminar in Warsaw. 
Poland already has a 25-year deal with Russia under which it must buy up to 
14 bcm annually, and analysts warn that a new long-term deal may seriously 
dent the financial standing of Polish gas distribution firms ahead of their 
planned sell-off. 
Poland does not plan to start selling its four gas distributors until next 
year, but analysts say that September general elections, strongly tipped to 
be won by the opposition social democrats, may delay those plans further.

India: A 'hurt' Godbole quits, persuaded to stay on

Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 23. DR MADHAV Godbole, Chairman of the Enron renegotiation panel, 
resigned this morning but the Maharashtra Government persuaded him to stay 
back and continue the renegotiation process with Enron. Dr Godbole withdrew 
his resignation in the evening. The second meeting of the panel which was 
scheduled for today with Enron representatives did not take place because of 
the Chairman's resignation. 
When contacted, Dr Godbole said: "I am withdrawing my resignation in the 
light of the Chief Minister's letter to me in which the Cabinet has 
unanimously asked me to take back my resignation. They have placed complete 
faith in me and the committee. The Cabinet has asked me to carry on with the 
complex and onerous task of negotiating with Dabhol Power Company."
Dr Godbole also said he had received calls from different political parties 
and various other organisations asking him to reconsider the decision to 
quit. He considered it a vote of their confidence in the committee and its 
working. 
Dr Godbole had quit in reaction to "derogatory remarks" made by the 
Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader, Mr Sharad Pawar. 
Last night, Mr Pawar had reportedly made a statement saying he was 
"apprehensive of the outcome of discussions with Enron as those leading the 
talks from the Government's side are working with a negative approach". 
Dr Godbole submitted his resignation to the Chief Minister saying he was 
"hurt" by Mr Pawar's statement. The NCP is one of the leading partners in 
Maharashtra's Government. 
"We will try and clear this misunderstanding. He (Godbole) has been appointed 
by the State Government. And the Government has no doubt about the 
committee's working. We want him to continue on the panel," Mr Chhagan 
Bhujbal, Deputy Chief Minister and NCP leader, said.

INDIAN GOVT TO ACCEPT PROPOSALS TO SETTLE POWER DISPUTE

05/24/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

NEW DELHI, May 24 Asia Pulse - The federal government will accept 
recommendations of the renegotiating committee headed by the Madhav Godbole 
for the settlement of the dispute between Dabhol Power Company (DPC) and the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). 
A government statement quoted Power Minister Suresh Prabhu as saying, "The 
Government of India is ready to consider any worthwile idea emerging out of 
the renegotiating committee for the settlement of the dispute."
The proposal, Prabhu said, has to be acceptable to the parties to the dispute 
- MSEB and Enron-promoted DPC - adding that a quick settlement of the 
differences was essential for the power sector of Maharashtra. 
DPC had last week slapped a preliminary termination notice (PTN) on MSEB 
following the dispute over payment of power bills. 
While former telecom secretary, A V Gokak, has been appointed as the federal 
government's nominee on the Godbole Committee constituted by the Maharashtra 
Government, a committee of senior officers of the concerned ministries has 
been set up to quickly examine the proposals emerging out of the negotiating 
committee, the statement said. 
The committee officers comprise officials of Ministries of Finance, Power and 
Petroleum.

Endesa to sell coal-powered plants operated by Electra de Viesgo (Endesa 
incluye una mayoria de centrales de carbon en Viesgo antes de venderla)

05/24/2001

Reporter (TM)

Endesa, the Spanish electricity company, has decided which assets to sell and 
it will auction its Electra de Viesgo subsidiary, which has 560,000 clients 
in the Cantabria region. This company has 2,610MW of generation assets and 36 
per cent of its plants are coal powered. Electra de Viesgo is estimated to be 
worth over 2bn euros (Pta332bn). Endesa is carrying out the sale in order to 
raise funds which will finance operations in other European countries and it 
has invited European and US energy companies to the auction. These include 
Hidrocantabrico, of Spain; Eon and RWE, of Germany, and Enron and AES, of the 
US. The winner will gain 3 per cent of the Spanish electricity distribution 
market and 5 per cent of the generation market. 
Hidrocantabrico is regarded as the favourite to acquire Electra de Viesgo. 
Its market, Cantabria, borders Asturias and the cost of integrating the two 
companies will enable it to make a higher offer than its rivals. However, 
Hidrocantabrico's complicated shareholder situation (EDP, EnBW, CajAstur and 
Ferroatlantica have to agree on the company's management), may be a 
hindrance. In order to carry out the sale, Endesa will transfer a series of 
power plants located throughout Spain to its subsidiary. These plants will 
represent a quarter of the generation assets to be sold by Endesa. The 
decision to sell follows Endesa's failed merger attempt with Iberdrola and 
will enable the company to invest without increasing its debts. According to 
market sources, Endesa may resume plans to merge with Iberdrola following the 
sale.

Is Pawar playing power politics with Enron?
Girish Kuber

05/24/2001
The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

MAHARASHTRA'S former chief minister Sharad Pawar's statement criticising 
Madhav Godbole, the head of the renegotiation team, and the timing chosen by 
him to air his views, has focused attention on his role in the Enron 
controversy. 
Pawar, who had first inked the Enron deal as the chief minister of 
Maharashtra in 1992, was at the center of controversy when the Opposition 
accused him of "favouring" the US energy giant.
The issue of Rs 64 crore being spent by Enron on "educating" Indians had 
become a political issue in the 1995 state Assembly elections which Pawar 
lost. 
In more recent times, Pawar has repeatedly intervened at crucial junctures. 
On the eve of Wednesday's session of the Godbole panel, Pawar criticised 
Godbole of having " a negative attitude" about Enron. Though Pawar did not 
name Godbole, the message was loud and clear. 
His statement comes at a time when the Maharashtra State Electricity is 
planning to issue a pre termination notice to Enron after the Godbole panel's 
scheduled meet on Wednesday. 
The board officials had discussed the issue with the state's advocate-general 
and were believed to have received a go-ahead from chief minister Vilasrao 
Deshmukh. 
Last October, when the state government had decided not to pay Enron's bills, 
Pawar convinced the state government to release Enron payments. It was after 
his intervention that the state government decided to appoint a committee to 
review the project. 
Surprisingly, last month, when Deshmukh had a meeting with Yashwant Sinha and 
Suresh Prabhu at Delhi, Pawar was seen accompanying the chief minister though 
his name did not figure on the official list of invitees. 
However, subsequently, the committee could not be formed since the faction 
loyal to Pawar in the state government was clearly against Godbole's 
appointment. 
State energy minister and Pawar's trusted aide, Padmasinh Patil, had publicly 
expressed his ire against Godbole. It was only after the Janata Dal, Peasents 
and Workers Party, CPI (M) and other anti-Enron groups threatened to withdraw 
support of the government, the Godbole Committee came into being. But not 
bofore a month was lost in a wrangling. Even after the committee's formation, 
Patil continued his tirade against Godbole. 
It was only chief minister Deshmukh's support that the Godbole Committee 
could survive the opposition from within. Political observers believe that it 
was the Congress' strategy to support the Godbole Committee that at the end 
could expose the wrongdoings of the earlier governments. 
As expected, the Godbole Committee, in its first report, exposed what it 
called the "lack of governance at every stage" in finalising the Enron deal. 
Godbole even suggested a judicial probe to pin those guilty for this "faulty 
deal". 
It was against this backdrop that Pawar's views on Godbole created a flutter 
on Wednesday. Although Godbole withdrew his resignation, it has certainly 
widened the rift between the NCP and Congress.

Godbole does a Mamata; quits, then back

IT'S not a comparison that springs naturally to mind. But Madhav Godbole, the 
former home secretary in charge of renegotiations with Enron, on Wednesday 
managed a passable imitation of Mamata Banerjee by resigning in the morning 
and withdrawing his resignation later in the day. 
In a day marked by considerable drama that briefly threatened the 
renegotiation process with Enron, Godbole decided not to press for his 
resignation after chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh personally expressed "full 
faith and confidence" in his ability to "handle the complex and onerous task 
of renegotiation".
Earlier in the day, Godbole, who took offence to former chief minister Sharad 
Pawar's "derogatory" remarks, decided to walk out of the panel. 
Pawar had last on Tuesday night said he was doubtful about the outcome of the 
ongoing renegotiations between the state and DPC as those heading the state 
government's panel did have a positive approach to resolve the issue. 
Godbole's swift decision to quit the panel sent shock waves at the Mantralaya 
-- headquarters of the state government -- as it seemed to threaten the 
existence of the government. 
The Janata Dal, Peasants and Workers Party and other splinter groups went to 
the extent of saying they would pull out of the nine-party coalition if 
Godbole's resignation was accepted. 
Following these development, the state government had to cancel the crucial 
second round of renegotiations with DPC slated for Wednesday. Enron and the 
Centre's representative were to attend the meet. 
"I have resigned due to the derogatory remarks made against me by Sharad 
Pawar last night," Godbole said on Wednesday morning. 
Godbole said instead of strengthening the negotiator's hands, such statements 
"loosen the concerned authority's grip over the fragile situation". 
However, chief minister Vilasrao Deshumukh appealed to him to reconsider his 
decision. "Godbole's in-depth knowledge and experience makes him 
indispensable for handling vexed issues such as renegotiation with the US 
energy giant," Deshmukh said. 
Deshmukh, after the Cabinet meet, sent a letter to Godbole expressing full 
confidence in him. "Godbole should not respond to statements from those 
outside the government," said Deshmukh. 
Meanwhile, Pawar, too, tried to control the damage. "It was my personal 
opinion that was not aimed at any particular person. Godbole should not have 
resigned. He should complete his task." 
Interestingly, Chagan Bhujbal, the state's deputy chief minister, was put on 
a re-fighting mission and asked to express faith in Godbole on behalf of the 
NCP, led by Pawar. 
Later in the evening Godbole decided not to press for the resignation. "I 
have received a letter from the chief minister expressing full confidence in 
my abilities. It also states the views expressed by Sharad Pawar were his 
personal views. He has said the state government had appointed me and they 
had no complaints against me. I, therefore, see no reason to press for my 
resignation," Godbole said. 
Meanwhile, the next meeting of the renegotiating panel has been convened on 
May 29.

		COMPANIES & FINANCE THE AMERICAS: Dynegy on the lookout for deals 
Financial Times; May 24, 2001
By JULIE EARLE

		Dynegy, the US gas and electricity supplier, has told analysts it will make 
large imminent acquisitions or mergers in the US and overseas. 
		The company told analysts at a conference in Texas on Tuesday that it was 
keen to make mergers and acquisitions in the near future. 
		The deals could include generation assets, gas pipeline and storage 
infrastructure, entire utilities and communication assets. Dynegy's customers 
are in North America, the UK and elsewhere in Europe. 
		Dynegy, which is Houston-based, was tight-lipped yesterday about any possible 
deals, saying only that it was "always looking for opportunities to enhance 
shareholder value". 
		The company told analysts it had an active oil, liquids, gas and power group 
fully integrated with its US operations, and was "poised to exploit 
opportunities". 
		It said it would like to own more European assets, but added that prices 
remained high, despite an oversupplied market. 
		Jay Yannello, an analyst for UBS Warburg in New York, said Dynegy could 
leverage aggressively any assets within its network infrastructure. 
		"We would not rule out substantial transactions," he said. 
		Dynegy told analysts it was looking for 10 per cent of the US power market 
and an ongoing 15 per cent share of the US gas market. 
		Dynegy and its competitors, including Enron and El Paso, have been recording 
big profits in the past two quarters, and and have come under fire from 
regulators over the California power crisis.

Surplus of Finger-Pointing In California Energy Crisis

Natural gas prices have plunged in the last few months -- everywhere, that 
is, but Southern California. While gas in New York costs about $4 per 
thousand cubic feet, gas delivered to Southern California still costs more 
than $11 wholesale. 
That such numbers demand an explanation was about the only thing President 
Bush and Gov. Gray Davis could agree on when they met in Los Angeles a few 
days ago to discuss California's energy crisis. Mr. Bush assigned Patrick H. 
Wood III, a fellow Texan confirmed last month as a member of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, to investigate.
To many experts, the woes of California's natural gas market are as profound 
as those of its electricity market: the state is short on pipelines, and the 
rules of the gas market, critics say, encourage sellers and traders -- 
including the biggest local gas utility -- to drive prices higher. 
At peak times, half of California's electricity is generated by gas-fired 
power plants, a higher proportion than in most parts of the country. And 
because 85 percent of the gas consumed in California comes from outside the 
state, the shortage of pipelines both into California and within the state 
has become a big handicap in fueling those plants. The strain has become 
especially acute as drought in the Pacific Northwest has curtailed imports of 
hydropower and gas-fired power plants have worked overtime to meet the 
demands of a booming state economy. 
Vice President Dick Cheney's energy policy report last month proposed 
initiatives to speed approval and construction of new pipelines, noting that 
New England and other regions faced capacity squeezes, too. The report says 
that the United States needs 38,000 miles of new gas transmission pipelines, 
almost a 20 percent increase. 
In the meantime, some industry executives and public officials take the 
argument one step further than the Bush administration, contending that 
today's shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies, 
intent on maximizing profits, to manipulate prices. 
''It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market,'' said 
Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the House 
energy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission to scrutinize the California gas market. ''Reasonable people could 
conclude people have gamed the system.'' 
In one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern 
California Edison, one of the state's struggling electric utilities, have 
accused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline into 
the state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing 
and accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the 
state's failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy 
commission is hearing the case in Washington. 
But fingers are pointing in other directions, too. 
For example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state's largest gas 
utility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year -- 
activity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for 
consumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that the 
trading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline space 
during peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power 
demands. 
At the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put 
enough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business 
customers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the market 
in the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping push 
gas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains. 
Between them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7 
billion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends. 
Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading has 
harmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators 
and industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for 
managing their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last 
year. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only 11 
percent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the same 
time during the prior two years. 
Another problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a 
member of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rules 
intended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost 
certainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and 
electricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow 
electricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher. 
Similarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial 
trading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics 
question whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives 
energy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight 
markets. 
Federal regulators ''don't seem to understand that firms are really trying to 
make as much money as they can,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the 
University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the 
Berkeley campus. ''That's what they do for a living.'' 
Fixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. ''If you build more 
capacity,'' he said, ''you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce the 
ability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power.'' 
Regardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California 
natural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimony 
has shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company's marketing 
affiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900 
million over the next 13 months. 
El Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to 
other companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to 
limit El Paso's exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactions 
were with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to 
people present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California 
officials. 
An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the 
other side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the 
pipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise of 
gas prices in California. 
Federal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may not 
be legitimate, have proposed requiring companies selling gas in the state to 
disclose extensive data about their transactions. They are also considering 
whether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity that 
were eliminated early last year. 
Further, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which 
energy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large 
customers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators 
have oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments, 
but they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey 
said. 
''The whole thing has fallen through the cracks,'' he said. 
Nearly all of California's gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain 
states and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In 
California, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to 
consumers and to underground storage fields for later use. 
Those pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 300 
million cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. The 
difference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300 
megawatt power plant -- enough to light more than a million homes. 
''It's not resources, it's straws -- the straws needed to suck this gas where 
it needs to go,'' said Thom Kelly, assistant executive director of the 
California Energy Commission. ''If the straws are full, that's a problem.'' 
Operators of interstate pipelines have proposed new construction that could 
double delivery to the state. Indeed, odd as it seems now, some in the 
industry worry that California could be ''overpiped'' later this decade, just 
as it was in the mid-1990's. 
Likewise, Southern California Gas plans only limited expansion of its 
in-state pipelines, partly because it expects demand to fall as hydroelectric 
power supplies return to normal levels and older, less efficient gas-fired 
power plants are phased out. 
But the gas company's intentions are regarded with skepticism by others in 
the industry. Some executives contend that Southern California Gas has 
damaged the marketplace through its enthusiastic embrace of a state program 
that allows it to split with customers the profits from buying, selling and 
lending gas. 
A coalition of power generators, including Reliant Energy, the Williams 
Companies and the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, has complained 
to state officials that the program ''creates perverse incentives'' for the 
gas company. The generators say it results in extra demand for pipeline space 
when capacity already is at a premium, making prices more volatile. 
The consequences of the gas company's low storage inventories were evident in 
early December, according to John Stout, a senior Reliant executive. He 
recalled listening in on a conference call as a Southern California Gas 
official talked about injecting gas into storage. ''I was floored,'' Mr. 
Stout said. ''Prices were sky high, and they were putting more upward 
pressure on prices.'' 
Lee M. Stewart, president of energy transportation services for Southern 
California Gas, called the criticism ''bogus.'' The utility's storage and 
trading practices have neither hurt the market nor curtailed gas sales to 
customers, he said. 
''To say gas prices drive electricity prices is a falsehood,'' Mr. Stewart 
added. 
But to many regulators, it is clear that gas prices play an increasingly 
important role in electricity prices. 
Problems in the California natural gas markets ''haven't been given the 
prominence they deserve for the detrimental role they are playing in high 
electricity prices,'' said Linda K. Breathitt, another member of the federal 
energy commission. ''Natural gas prices have been the stepchild of this 
California crisis.'' 
This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series 
''Frontline,'' which will broadcast a documentary about California's energy 
crisis tonight.

big handicap in fueling those plants. (Source: California Energy

Economy
Price-Curb Plan: Is It California Dreaming? --- Regulators Again Tackle Power 
Market That Remains Chaotic

Federal regulators have launched yet another attempt to control California's 
out-of-control wholesale electricity market. But like previous efforts, it 
could have limited effectiveness. 
Already, critics are predicting failure for the new "price mitigation" plan 
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission put into effect last week. The 
FERC's pricing plan is again "laced with loopholes," says California Gov. 
Gray Davis, who says that "it's worse than too little, too late."
Backers say the new initiative is more comprehensive and less susceptible to 
manipulation by power suppliers than previous efforts. They note that some 
electricity prices fell last week following implementation of the order. A 
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which runs the 
state's transmission grid and has been critical of the new FERC plan, says it 
is too early for her organization to evaluate the initiative's impact. 
FERC's new plan attempts to control prices during periods of relatively tight 
supply. In contrast to previous controls that had specific dollar targets, 
the new plan uses a fluctuating market price derived from production costs at 
California plants. Prices above this benchmark will be subject to FERC review 
and possible refunds by suppliers. 
The price-control efforts have been prompted by a botched 1996 California 
utility-deregulation plan that contributed to leaving the state with 
extremely tight power supplies. In May 2000, wholesale electricity prices 
began soaring. Power that previously fetched $20 to $40 a megawatt hour began 
trading for hundreds of dollars. 
Officials first tried price caps. For example, caps ranging from $750 down to 
$250 a megawatt hour have been in place at various times on the power that 
the ISO buys, at the last minute, to avoid shortages. During several hundred 
hours last summer, it appeared that the caps restrained some electricity 
prices from going higher, according to a recent study by the California State 
Auditor. 
The market became progressively tougher to control, though. Under the state's 
deregulation design, the vast majority of the power needs was to be purchased 
a day ahead of time. As the crisis worsened last year, suppliers and buyers 
began to see economic advantages from doing more transactions in the ISO 
real-time, last-minute market. Eventually, more than a quarter of the 
system's electricity needs were, at times, obtained through the ISO market, 
far more than ever anticipated. 
Having so many last-minute purchases endangered the reliability of the 
transmission system. To discourage transactions in the last-minute market, 
officials began ratcheting down the price cap there, lowering it to $250 in 
August. 
But suppliers apparently found ways to avoid the tighter cap. One such method 
is known as "megawatt laundering." Since the caps didn't apply to power 
coming from out-of-state suppliers, California generators had an incentive to 
sell power to a purchaser in another state, who could then quickly sell back 
the juice through the ISO at whatever the market would bear. 
After the ISO price cap went down to $250, so-called out-of-market 
transactions, which include out-of-state power purchases, soared to an 
average of 5,000 megawatts an hour by early December from almost nothing. At 
the same time, sales through the ISO's real-time market fell to a trickle. 
Prices of the out-of-market transactions in December averaged $461 a megawatt 
hour, nearly twice the price cap. 
Part of this surge might be explained by a sharp rise in the cost of natural 
gas, a major power-plant fuel. As rising fuel costs pushed up generating 
costs, producers had an added incentive for avoiding the California price 
caps, say some observers. 
Several state and federal investigations are looking for evidence of illegal 
manipulation in the skyrocketing prices for natural gas and electricity. Much 
electricity is sent out of state under perfectly proper, long-term 
arrangements. Even "megawatt laundering," though a pejorative phrase, isn't 
necessarily illegal unless it is part of a concerted effort to drive up 
market prices, say state and federal officials. 
Spurred by the rapid rise in out-of-market transactions, ISO officials 
abandoned the price cap in December. FERC then approved a "soft cap" 
price-control plan. Sales made at more than $150 a megawatt hour were subject 
to FERC review and possible refund orders if the price was found to be too 
far above the supplier's costs. So far, FERC has tentatively ordered over 
$100 million in refunds. Critics of that FERC soft cap say it was too 
generous in its calculations of production costs and far too limited in its 
scope. The cap only kicked in during a Stage 3 alert, when supplies were so 
tight that rolling blackouts were imminent. Some state officials and others 
argue that the FERC should be ordering billions of dollars in refunds for 
prices charged over the past year. 
The price-control feature of the new FERC plan covers more hours than the 
previous one but will still be restricted to times of relatively tight 
supply. Critics say controls should be in effect during all hours, since 
prices have often been high around the clock. 
Plus, the new plan still fails "to take any constructive steps to eliminate 
or even to minimize the pernicious effects of `megawatt laundering,'" says a 
recent ISO filing with the FERC. Out-of-state sales still aren't covered by 
the latest plan, which leaves suppliers with a large potential loophole for 
reaping higher power prices. The volume of out-of-market transactions has 
remained high this year. In April, the price for such deals averaged $372 a 
megawatt hour. 
Gov. Davis and others argue that price controls need to be extended 
throughout the Western U.S. In its decision unveiling the new control plan, 
FERC acknowledged that more may be needed on the laundering issue. It opened 
an investigation into sales transactions around the West. The terms of such 
sales, said the FERC decision, might not be "just and reasonable." 
--- Another Try

Main points of FERC price-mitigation plan:

-- Creates a price benchmark, based on production costs, to be used
in periods of tight electricity supplies. Sales at prices above
benchmark are subject to possible refunds.
-- Requires all generators in California to offer all available
capacity around the clock to the state's transmission-system operator.
-- Requires weekly reports from state officials to FERC regarding bid 
data and plant outages.
-- Initiates investigation into electricity trading in other Western
states.

TUNED IN 'Blackout' Tries to Shed Light on Crisis

With each passing day, there's seemingly a new surge in California's energy 
crisis. 
"Frontline" addresses that hot-button issue tonight in an hour aptly titled 
"Blackout" (9 p.m. KCET, 10 p.m. KVCR).
Through interviews with state and federal officials, utility executives and 
industry insiders, the documentary examines whether power companies and 
energy-trading giants have capitalized on deregulation to accrue enormous 
profits as consumers and business owners suffer power shortages and rising 
rate hikes. 
Jeff Skilling, CEO of the Enron Corp., the largest energy trader in the 
world, sees his company as one of the "good guys." 
"We are working to create open, competitive, fair markets," he tells reporter 
Lowell Bergman, who wryly notes that if true, lately the good guys have been 
winning since the past year has seen a large transfer of wealth from energy 
consumers to power sellers and traders like Enron. 
After raising the topics of deregulation and the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & 
Electric, Bergman interviews S. Davis Freeman, the former Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power chief, Gov. Gray Davis and Vice President Dick 
Cheney. 
There are no easy answers in this complex issue, with one side pointing 
fingers at the other, but one thing is certain: A long, hot summer is likely 
to yield more rolling blackouts for California consumers, while other states 
wait to see if they will be adversely affected as well.

Energy Alley to blame for California's woes? 
Frontline joins in Texas bashing on energy 
By ANN HODGES 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Critic 
Frontline joins hands with the New York Times tonight, to jump into what 
California Gov. Gray Davis has turned into a marathon news blast at Texas, 
and at Houston, over his state's energy woes. 
Frontline: Blackout, airing at 10 tonight, should have Davis and his 
bash-Texas troops giving each other high fives. 
In its opening minutes, Frontline's narration sets a tone for Texas-bashing: 
"Investigators (otherwise unidentified) claim that a handful of energy 
companies siphoned billions from consumers while the lights (in California) 
were out. 
"If you want to understand the story of electric power in America today, you 
have to follow the electrons and follow the money. It's a story that starts 
here, in Houston, Texas." 
The blame game is in high gear, as Frontline's dust-up hovers over Houston. 
Houston's Energy Alley, home of "electric cowboys" (Frontline's words), is 
the focus of this "follow-the-money" trail. 
And Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, "the 800-pound gorilla" in the Alley, gets 
the major grilling in its high-powered interview hot seat, along with Enron 
CEO Jeff Skilling. 
Interviewees also include Vice President Dick Cheney, California and federal 
officials, other company executives, industry insiders and what Frontline 
calls "whistle-blowers." 
Politics and finger-pointing fuel charges and countercharges, with Frontline 
correspondent and New York Times contributor Lowell Bergman conducting the 
interviews, and an off-camera narration spinning the sound and fury. 
With blackouts expected to hit New York this summer, "the entire country will 
soon be short on power," Frontline asserts to set the stage. 
"The generators have made more money than God. I mean, they've made 7, 8, 900 
percent profit," Davis charges. 
"Now that a fellow Texan sits in the White House," Frontline says, "the 
companies on Energy Alley are hoping things will only get better. ... Lay is 
a personal friend and big backer of President Bush, and he and his executives 
have been the Bush family's most generous contributors. ... " 
"There are a few of us that are still maybe idealistic enough to think that 
we can kind of support a candidate because we really believe in the 
individual," Lay counters. "We believe in their policies. We believe in the 
direction they are going to take the country." 
El Paso Corp., the largest natural gas company, gets its lumps, too, from 
California officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was 
ready to dismiss California's complaint of price manipulation at the state's 
borders, Frontline says, "until Frontline and the New York Times obtained 
sealed documents revealing discussions at El Paso's highest levels." 
"Those documents are irrelevant," El Paso spokeswoman Peggy Heeg says. 
Frontline passes its golden opportunity to lay out, clearly and concisely, 
both sides -- what critics say are the self-inflicted origins of California's 
energy crisis, and California's charges of price-gouging and pleas for price 
caps. Instead, that information comes piecemeal, over the course of 
contentious and often-confusing exchanges. 
To avoid retreat on deregulation, now in progress in 24 states, companies 
have begun to raise the possibility of settlement with California, Frontline 
reports. In Lay's opinion, "It's still going to take a comprehensive 
settlement of the whole issue, all the issues" -- including money. 
Give Frontline full credit for stepping in where no other TV news outlet has 
dared to tread in such depth. Something is surely better than nothing. 
But this Frontline/New York Times team coverage effort does not cool the 
blame game. It sheds more heat than light.

PBS pledge drive alters schedule 
By MIKE McDANIEL 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle TV Editor 
Paul Hope, like many theater fans, tuned to Channel 8 Sunday night in 
anticipation of the first hour of the joint PBS/CBS telecast of the 55th 
Annual Tony Awards. 
What he got instead was a travelog hosted by Rudy Maxa. Because this is 
pledge drive week, Channel 8 did not air the first hour of the three-hour 
award show, as it has in previous years. 
"Channel 8 has made Houston a theatrical cowtown by this decision," Hope, a 
resident actor at the Alley, said Monday. 
Alley artistic director Gregory Boyd called the preempting "absolutely 
indefensible and shocking." 
Fortunately, Channel 8 is being more flexible about a second program that it 
had originally decided not to air this week. 
Frontline, which airs nationally at 9 p.m. tonight, takes a hard look at 
California's energy problems and their direct connection to Houston. The 
telecast includes interviews with several Houston players, including Enron's 
Kenneth Lay. 
KUHT station manager John Hesse said Channel 8 became aware of the Frontline 
story, titled Blackout, and its Houston connection last week. Because of its 
local news value, the show will be tape-delayed and aired on KUHT at 10 
tonight. It will be repeated at 9 p.m. June 12, when Channel 8 originally had 
planned to air the show. 
"When we learned of the local significance, we obviously wanted that program 
to air (here) in a timely manner as in the rest of the country," Hesse said. 
"We are getting a little bit of heat for the Tony thing," Hesse said. "The 
problem is, it's right in the beginning of our pledge evening. We had a 
schedule in place, and a decision was made to stick to that schedule because 
that was our opportunity for fund raising." 
Fund drives are vital to keep the station operating and to purchase quality 
programming. 
"When we're scheduling our pledge dates, we try to coordinate the normal PBS 
schedule with what we determine will do the best for us in terms of fund 
raising," Hesse said. "We only use about 2 percent of our air time a year in 
fund-raising efforts, and when we're using that 2 percent, we have to make 
the most of them." 
That's no comfort to the folks who were hoping to experience what turned out 
to be theatrical history being made. Mel Brooks' The Producers -- not only 
the talk of Broadway but also the entertainment world -- won a record 12 
Tonys Sunday night. 
Most were awarded in the show's first hour -- where Tonys for director, 
choreographer and other categories are handed out. To diehards, the PBS 
portion of the Tonys exceeds CBS' in that it airs without commercials and 
includes behind-the-scenes interviews with directors, composers, designers 
and others. 
Hesse explained that Channel 8's pledge-drive dates were set before the 
station knew whether PBS would even have the Tonys. 
The first hour of Sunday's show had direct links to theater talents whose 
work has been seen and heralded in Houston. 
David Woolard, nominated for best costume design for The Rocky Horror Show, 
is costume designer of The Carpetbagger's Children, which opens Wednesday at 
the Alley. 
Doug Besterman, a winner Sunday for his orchestrations for The Producers, has 
done the same for the Frank (Jekyll and Hyde) Wildhorn productions that have

PBS Shines Light on Energy Crisis

LOS ANGELES (AP) - As California's energy crisis casts a widening shadow, 
PBS' "Frontline" helps illuminate the issue with a high-wattage documentary. 
"Blackout" is both a comprehensive report and a warning: California's power 
deregulation woes represent a national problem not destined for a quick or 
painless solution.
The hourlong film, with reporting by "Frontline" correspondent Lowell Bergman 
done in conjunction with The New York Times, airs 10 p.m. EDT Tuesday on PBS 
stations (check local listings). 
If you're a consumer frustrated by price hikes or concerned about what might 
happen in your state, "Blackout" should be considered required viewing. Major 
players, ranging from power company chiefs to consumer advocates to Vice 
President Dick Cheney, make their case on energy policy. 
Gov. Gray Davis and others grappling with California's flawed new system, 
which has inspired many states to put their own deregulation efforts on hold, 
are interviewed. 
"Blackout" also touches on alleged machinations involving the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission that could affect how much, if at all, the federal 
government will weigh in on power prices, and renews questions about 
corporate influence on the Bush administration. 
What ultimately emerges is a classic debate, framed in 2001 political 
realities, over whether an unfettered market is invariably the best approach 
or whether capitalism sometimes must bend to regulation. 
Bergman is adamant about the importance of understanding a power industry 
that has undergone massive change. 
"We've launched ourselves into a great economic and social experiment in the 
free market with a commodity that 65 years ago the country decided to put 
under heavy regulation because it was so vital," he said in an interview. 
"We've gone into this experiment without having a full national debate about 
what the consequences could be," Bergman said. "It may all work out, but it's 
clear that we're at least in a transition period where a lot of people are 
going to pay the price." 
In New York, for instance, blackouts are a possibility this summer and rate 
hikes of up to 40 percent a likelihood, Bergman said. 
There are those striking it rich in this bold new world. "Blackout" opens on 
Houston's "energy alley," home to new-breed power companies including what 
the documentary calls the 800-pound gorilla, Enron Corp. 
Enron, which has drawn attention because of chairman Kenneth Lay's close ties 
to President Bush, generates profits by serving as middleman between 
electricity makers and consumers. 
The world's largest energy trader, Enron sees from $2.5 billion to $3 billion 
in purchases and sales a day, according to its chief executive officer, Jeff 
Skilling. 
"We are doing the right thing," Skilling tells "Blackout." "We are working to 
create open, competitive, fair markets. ... We are the good guys. We are on 
the side of angels." 
If that's true, Bergman says in the film, the good guys have been winning: 
The past year saw a "vast transfer" of wealth from energy consumers to power 
sellers and traders like Enron. 
They are taking advantage of the end of an era: the federal regulatory system 
implemented by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1930s to limit abuses 
by utility monopolies. 
In the 1980s, "Blackout" tells us, free-market proponents began pushing for 
an end to regulation. In 1992, a federal law was passed that allowed for 
states to deregulate electricity. 
There was broad but not unanimous support for such change. 
"It's OK for the price of fur coats to go up and down. ... It's not OK for 
the oxygen of life in this high-energy civilization," David Freeman, the 
former Los Angeles Department of Water and Power head and now state energy 
czar, tells "Blackout." 
Mark Cooper, director of research at the Consumer Federation of America, who 
notes there have already been price spikes in electricity in the Midwest and 
New England, says the outcome speaks for itself. 
"How do we go from $40 a megawatt for capacity in a regulated system to 
$1,000 in a deregulated system, and you're telling me I'm better off?" Cooper 
asks in the documentary. 
Enron's Lay weighs in on the other side. 
"I've yet to see any system in the world ... that over time does a better job 
of setting prices and allocating supplies than a competitive market," Lay 
says in "Blackout." 
He has a key philosophical ally in the Bush administration, which says 
increased supply and not federal intervention is the logical answer. 
"We're doing everything we can to help California on a short-term basis," 
Cheney says. "There's not a lot you can do. You can't manufacture kilowatts 
in the West Wing of the White House." 
Bergman, the former "60 Minutes" producer who was portrayed in the movie "The 
Insider," believes there is one certainty about the power crisis: The media 
generally has given it short shrift. 
"Unfortunately this story has been covered, particularly on television, in 
much the same way a car crash is covered. You never learn whether the car was 
safe or the highway was safe. You just see the blood and guts." 
"Nobody's spent the air time to explain to people how this all happened and 
why this may be coming to a neighborhood near you."

Senate to subpoena documents from power generators

06/05/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - The state Senate Rules Committee has agreed to 
issue subpoenas to eight out-of-state electricity generators, including two 
from Texas, demanding documents on bidding, pricing and other aspects of 
power sales in California. 
The subpoenas would help a special Senate committee's investigation into 
whether the companies are illegally profiteering from California's power 
crisis.
The committee's chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, said he expects the 
companies to resist, setting the stage for a court battle. Though energy 
executives seemed cooperative when the investigation was launched two months 
ago, they have since demanded that confidentiality protection for their 
documents, Dunn said. 
Energy executives deny that they've broken any laws selling electricity to 
California at record-high prices. 
Dunn's committee is looking within the state for answers as well. 
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power could find its records 
subpoenaed if it doesn't provide information on its power sales. The manager 
of the state's power grid reported the DWP had made large profits by selling 
power to the rest of the state. 
The committee may even subpoena records from the state Department of Water 
Resources unless it turns over information on how it has spent more than $7 
billion to keep the state's lights on. 
The Legislature also needs information on the electricity the state DWP buys 
from wholesalers for the customers of the state's three largest 
investor-owned utilities, and the bidding strategies used to the make the 
bids, said Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, vice chairman of the rules panel. 
Davis has refused to release details of the deals, warning that if generators 
knew how much the state was spending on power they might raise their prices. 
Several news organizations and a legislator are suing to make the information 
public. 
The subpoenas will be issued to Reliant Energy of Houston, which Gov. Gray 
Davis has publicly accused of price gouging, Dynegy Energy Services Inc., 
Williams Energy, Houston-based Enron Corp., NRG Energy Inc., Duke Energy, 
Mirant Inc., and AES Corp. 
Dunn's panel needed approval of the rules committee to issue the subpoenas 
under Senate regulations. 
The committee won't issue the subpoenas for at least one-week, after the 
chairman of the Rules Committee, Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San 
Francisco, opposed issuing subpoenas to the city and state departments, at 
least temporarily.

California; Metro Desk
Panel OKs Subpoenas for Energy Companies Electricity: Special state Senate 
committee will demand pricing information in inquiry into whether California 
has been gouged.

SACRAMENTO -- The Senate Rules Committee agreed Monday to issue subpoenas to 
eight out-of-state power generating companies demanding documents on pricing, 
bidding and other aspects of electricity sales in the state. 
Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana), chairman of the special Senate committee that is 
investigating whether power wholesalers are illegally profiteering from 
California's energy crisis, said he expects the companies to resist. That 
would set the stage for a court fight, he said.
In addition to subpoenas aimed at the private generating companies, the 
committee also put the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power on notice 
that unless it voluntarily provides information on its power sales to the 
state, the data will be subpoenaed as well. And the panel threatened to 
subpoena records of the state Department of Water Resources unless it turns 
over information on how it has spent more than $7 billion to keep electricity 
flowing in California. 
Under Senate regulations, Dunn's panel needed approval of the Rules Committee 
to issue the subpoenas. 
Industry executives deny that they have broken any laws in selling 
electricity at premium prices to California's financially strapped utilities 
and the state water department. 
The subpoenas will be issued to Reliant Energy, which Gov. Gray Davis has 
publicly accused of price gouging, Dynegy Energy Services Inc., Williams 
Energy, Enron Corp., NRG Energy Inc., Duke Energy, Mirant Inc., and AES Corp. 
Dunn said executives of the generators seemed cooperative when the 
investigation was launched two months ago. Since then, he said, they have 
raised barriers, including demands that the confidentiality of their 
documents be protected. 
The demand for information from the Los Angeles DWP and the state's water 
resources department were pushed by Sen. Ross Johnson (R-Irvine), vice 
chairman of the rules panel. 
"Why are we not attempting to subpoena the Los Angeles Department of Water 
and Power? There certainly have been suggestions that they have profited," 
Johnson said, referring to reports from the California Independent System 
Operator about large profits that DWP made by selling power to the rest of 
the state. 
Reflecting the views of many lawmakers, Johnson said the Legislature also 
needs information on power purchases that the state water department makes 
from wholesalers and the bidding strategies used to make the bids. 
Davis has refused to make details of the purchases public. He contends that 
if generators knew how much the state was spending on power, they might raise 
their prices. Several news organizations and a legislator are suing to make 
the information public. 
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco), chairman of the Rules 
Committee, opposed issuing subpoenas to the city and state departments, at 
least temporarily, leading to the agreement for a one-week delay before 
subpoenas would be issued to the agencies. 
The big energy companies also took a hit Monday from a leading advocacy group 
for the poor. 
The Pacific Institute for Community Organization, a coalition of faith-based 
groups that has pressed for California to cover more of the millions of 
working citizens without any health insurance, voiced concern that the energy 
crisis is hitting the poor hardest. 
The group, which scheduled a Capitol rally today, plans to urge political 
leaders to use the economic power of the state's huge pension funds to 
leverage the companies. 
The two pension funds own at least $1.2 billion in stocks and bonds in most 
of the major firms involved in the state energy crisis, from Enron of Texas 
to Duke of North Carolina, the advocates said. 
"They could bring the voice of stockholders into the debate, as a major 
stockholder, and take a more enlightened view of what is happening to 
California," said activist Jim Keddy. "We really have no voice inside those 
companies right now."

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Save Dabhol Project (Update1)
2001-06-05 02:40 (New York)

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Save Dabhol Project (Update1)

     (Adds importance of Dabhol Power for future investment in
India, in third paragraph.)

     Singapore, June 5 (Bloomberg) -- Industrial Development Bank
of India and other Indian banks that helped fund Enron Corp.'s
first investment in the nation are meeting in Singapore to try to
persuade international lenders to keep the $3 billion power
project alive.
     International banks such as ABN Amro Holding NV, Citibank NA,
a unit of Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First
Boston in April approved a decision by Enron unit Dabhol Power to
terminate its supply agreement with Maharashtra State Electricity
Board in a row over electricity prices.
     Unlike the Indian banks, foreign lenders received government
guarantees for about $600 million they lent to the project, which
is seen as a litmus test for future foreign investment in Indian
infrastructure projects. The Indian banks fear the foreign
creditors will cancel the project and invoke their guarantees.
     ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the
problem,'' said R.S. Agarwal, an executive director at Industrial
Development Bank of India, or IDBI, the biggest lender to the
Dabhol project.
     The outcome of the two-day meeting, being held in the offices
of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international lenders
to the project, will be crucial to the Indian banks, which have
lent as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.
     IDBI has exposure of 21.58 billion rupees ($460 million) to
the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in guarantees.
Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra State
Electricity Board are in dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid
bills for December and January. Others bills through March have
been paid.
     The board has refused to pay the December and January bills
saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penal
the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full
capacity on Jan. 28.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.
     The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to
change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.''
Fitch said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.



		

		
		

		
		ASIA-PACIFIC: Enron 'frustrated' by talks 
Financial Times; Jun 5, 2001
By JULIE EARLE and KHOZEM MERCHANT

		Enron, the US energy group, says it is becoming "increasingly frustrated" 
with its negotiations with the Maharashtra state government agencies in 
India. 
		The US energy group denied reports that it was renegotiating the contract and 
the tariff between its Indian arm, the Dabhol Power Company, and its sole 
customer, Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB). "That is not true," 
said an Enron spokesman at the weekend. "Why would we renegotiate with 
counter parties? They are trying to imply a contract that was in place for 
eight years and operating for two years does not exist." The denial came as 
Indian and foreign banks prepared to try to bridge their differences over 
sustaining support for Dabhol's Dollars 2.9bn power project near Bombay, 
which has been supplying the Maharashtra utility. 
		A two-day meeting in Singapore starting today will aim to stake out common 
ground, which lenders hope will remove the uncertainty dogging the 
controversial 2,184MW power project. 
		The Indian utility owes Dabhol Dollars 45m (Pounds 32m) but is demanding in 
turn a greater sum in rebates for what it describes as the US company's 
failure to meet technical thresholds. 
		Lenders have stopped disbursing loans to the 1,444MW second phase of the 
project, which is due for completion soon. The 740MW first phase was 
commissioned in May 1999. ABN Amro and Bank of America are two of the banks 
that will thrash out the issues with State Bank of India, Industrial 
Development Bank of India and ICICI. 
		People close to the talks say the situation has "worsened" since the last 
lenders' meeting in April, when Dabhol received authorisation to quit the 
project. Dabhol has since issued a pre-termination notice, signalling its 
intent to withdraw in six months if a solution is not found. MSEB has 
responded to the threat by abandoning its power purchase contract with the 
company.

India Lenders Mtg Seeks To Salvage Enron Dabhol Pwr Proj
By Himendra Kumar
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/05/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Indian institutions that have lent money to Enron 
Corp.'s (ENE) controversial Dabhol Power Co. are expected to make a 
collective bid to salvage the beleaguered power project during a two-day 
meeting this week in Singapore. 
Domestic lenders, which include the Industrial Development Bank of India, the 
State Bank of India (P.SBI) and ICICI Ltd. (IC), have the highest exposure to 
the DPC's US$2.9 billion project and are anxious not to see it collapse. The 
Dabhol Power project represents India's biggest foreign investment deal in 
India to date.
"We want the project to run," IDBI General Manager R.M. Ganatra told Dow 
Jones Newswires ahead of the meeting. 
"The Indian lenders will make a common cause at the lenders' meeting to 
prevent Enron from pulling out. The Indians have lent US$1.4 billion out of 
the project's total projected cost of US$2.9 billion. As IDBI's own exposure 
is in the excess of 20 billion rupees (US$1=INR47.01), the bank runs the risk 
of going deep into the red if this project goes bust," he said. 
Indian lenders have mutually decided to block further loans to Dabhol's 
second phase until an agreement was reached, Ganatra added. Dispute Has 
Unnerved Foreign Lenders 

The Dabhol Power project, situated in the western state of Maharashtra, will 
generate 2,184 megawatts of electricity when the second phase is scheduled to 
be completed later this year. 
Texas-based Enron has a 65% stake in DPC and is the project's largest 
shareholder. Other shareholders include the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, or MSEB, with 15%, General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) with 
10% each. 
Enron is at the center of a power supply dispute between the state government 
and Dabhol Power over what the government claims are "unaffordable" power 
tariffs. 
The dispute has unnerved foreign lenders. Domestic lenders at this week's 
meeting in Singapore are expected to try and calm frayed nerves. 
Ganatra, together with other domestic lenders, feel the dispute between DPC 
and its sole buyer MSEB is still resolvable despite DPC's issue of a 
preliminary termination notice in April. 
He said the fundamental issue in the dispute was the cost of power and added, 
"There was need for an agreement on a reasonable tariff." 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 a kilowatt-hour for its power, 
compared with INR1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. 
Domestic lenders want the federal government to clear MSEB's defaults of 
US$48 million and also find additional buyers for DPC's electricity, possibly 
the state-owned power utility like National Thermal Power Corp. Ltd. (P.NTP), 
from the second phase of the Dabhol project. 
Ganatra also urged the federal government to take a more active role in 
conflict resolution. "The government should not shirk its responsibility and 
it should set a time limit for the MSEB and DPC to sort out their dispute 
with the lenders' interests in mind," he said.

Developments in California's energy crisis

06/05/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Developments in California's energy crisis: 
TUESDAY:
- A leading advocacy group for the poor tells state leaders to use the 
economic power of the state's huge pension funds to leverage power companies. 
The Pacific Institute for Community Organization says the two pension funds 
own at least $1.2 billion in stocks and bonds in most of the firms that sell 
electricity to California. 
MONDAY: 
- A special Senate committee investigating whether out-of-state power 
companies are illegally profiteering the state's power crisis gets permission 
from the Senate Rules Committee to subpoena documents from the companies 
detailing bidding, pricing and other aspects of their electricity sales to 
the state. The committee plans to subpoena Mirant, Dynegy, Williams, AES, 
Duke, Enron, NRG and Reliant, and could also issue subpoenas to the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power and the state Department of Water 
Resources to access details of their power selling and buying processes, 
respectively. 
- The state's grid operator says California's electricity production should 
improve in the coming weeks as more power plants come back on line after 
spring maintenance shutdowns. That, coupled with conservation efforts, could 
help during this summer's high temperatures, independent observers say - but 
not enough to stave off blackouts. 
- The state's expanded Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) 
program begins with $120 million in state money. It is aimed at helping 
working poor households, senior citizens, disabled persons, migrant seasonal 
farm workers, limited-English-speaking persons and households with very young 
children whose incomes fall at or below 250 percent of the federal poverty 
level. 
That includes households with four members having an annual gross income of 
$44,125 or less; three-member households earning $36,575 or less; two-member 
families earning $29,025 or less; and individuals earning under $21,475. 
Further information is available at www.csd.ca.gov or at 1-800-433-4327 
(HEAP). 
- Ten schools in three Southern California districts cut their electricity 
waste up to 18 percent through the Alliance to Save Energy's Green Schools 
Program. Together, the schools saved more than $51,000 over about eight 
months by changing their usage habits, according to Southern California 
Edison, which sponsored the program. More information is available at 
www.ase.org/greenschools. 
- Critics tell the San Jose Mercury News that the federal agency overseeing 
California's electricity market needs to add resources and become more 
aggressive in watching for energy price gouging, issuing subpoenas for 
company documents if necessary. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has 
been accused of backing off investigations after energy generators have 
resisted, prompting some FERC officials to say their own system is flawed. 
- The FERC issues a statement saying it won't act on a request from small 
power generators to block a March 27 decision from the state Public Utilities 
Commission that has lowered the price they can charge for electricity. FERC 
says it won't step in because the matter is still pending at the PUC. 
- No power alerts Monday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent. 
- Shares of Edison International closed at $10.58, down 42 cents. PG&E Corp. 
closed at $11.40, down 25 cents. Sempra Energy, the parent company of San 
Diego Gas & Electric, closes at $27.34, up 20 cents. 
WHAT'S NEXT: 
- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent company 
of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission lines. 
-In federal bankruptcy court Tuesday, Pacific Gas and Electric will ask U.S. 
Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to stop the manager of the state's power grid 
from buying electricity for utility or charging it for any electricity bought 
after the utility filed for bankruptcy on April 6. 
THE PROBLEM: 
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight 
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and 
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's 
electricity crisis. 
Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high 
wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from 
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs 
from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection 
April 6. 
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor 
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to 
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and 
business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned 
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than 
much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power 
costs. 
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37 
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial 
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15 
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's 
multibillion-dollar power buys.

Marathon joins Saudi gas venture 
Company replacing Enron in partnership 
By TOM FOWLER 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Houston-based USX-Marathon Group has taken over Enron Corp.'s abandoned stake 
in a $25 billion natural-gas venture in Saudi Arabia. 
Marathon, the fourth-biggest U.S. oil company, will join project leader Exxon 
Mobil Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. in the "Red Sea Consortium," one 
of three exploration and development projects under the larger venture. 
Enron originally was named part of the deal, but on Friday the company pulled 
out without explanation, giving up its 20 percent stake in a portion of the 
project that initial estimates value at around $5 billion. 
Marathon was one of more than a dozen companies that bid on the project 
initially and one of several that did not make the final cut announced two 
weeks ago. 
Marathon, which has a long-standing relationship with the Saudis as a crude 
oil customer, had officials in Saudi Arabia for Sunday's signing ceremony, 
along with Exxon, Occidental, the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, BP, TotalFinaElf 
Houston-based Conoco and Phillips Petroleum Co. 
The projects are the first gas-exploration business Saudi Arabia has offered 
to international companies in 20 years. The country wants to convert its 
oil-powered utilities to run on cheaper natural gas, but needs international 
investments because of two decades of budget deficits. 
The gas business may not offer the companies the best profit margins compared 
with other projects, but it may give them a lead over rivals if Saudi Arabia 
lets international companies develop crude-oil reserves. 
The companies are expected to spend $17 billion on the biggest project and 
about $4 billion on another. The size of the Red Sea project still is 
unclear, Marathon spokesman Roger Holliday said. 
"My understanding is there's exploration involved, and the final scope of the 
project will be determined later," he said. 
Saudi officials liked some of the creative proposals Marathon included in its 
initial failed bid for the work, Holliday said, and indicated previously that 
there could be some potential work for the company. 
Enron's departure from the deal last week surprised many analysts, but is 
somewhat consistent with the company's decreasing emphasis on infrastructure 
projects. 
Enron withdrew from a $3.5 billion pipeline project to export natural gas 
from Qatar last month, while other international projects have proved to be 
difficult. A power-generation project in India has run into trouble because 
of disagreements between Enron and the Indian government over electricity 
prices, and Enron officials said Friday that a $130 million power plant 
project in Ontario may be in jeopardy because of the provincial government's 
foot-dragging over electricity deregulation. 
"I'm dumbfounded that they would pull out of a major project announced only 
two weeks ago," Goldman, Sachs & Co. analyst David Fleischer told Bloomberg 
News. "On the other hand, they're more of a services company than an energy 
company these days." 
Enron appears to be focusing on its rapidly growing commodity trading 
business, which includes trading natural gas, electricity, broadband Internet 
capacity and even such items as broadcast advertising time.

Domtar buys G-P mills for $1.65B
by Soma Biswas

06/05/2001
The Daily Deal
Copyright (c) 2001 The Deal LLC

Georgia-Pacific Corp.'s acquisition of the four pulp and paper mills 
transforms the company into the second-largest producer of uncoated freesheet 
in North America. 
http://www.domtar.com/domtar/english/newsrel.htm on Monday announced a final 
deal to buy four pulp-and-paper mills from Georgia-Pacific Corp. for $1.65 
billion.
For Montreal-based Domtar, the acquisition transforms the company from the 
seventh-largest producer of uncoated freesheet (used as printing and copying 
paper) in North America into the second-largest producer. It also becomes the 
third-largest producer of uncoated freesheet in the world, behind 
International Paper Co., of Purchase, N.Y., and Singapore-based Asia Pulp & 
Paper Co. 
The acquisition will boost Domtar's revenues to C$6 billion ($3.9 billion) 
from C$4 billion, of which 75% will come from the U.S. 
Atlanta-based Domtar's shares rose 60 cents per share on the New York Stock 
Exchange to $15.75, and Georgia-Pacific's shares fell 10 cents per share to 
$35.30 per share. 
The company will raise debt and equity worth $900 million in the public 
markets, including a secondary share offering in the U.S. The price includes 
$200 million in working capital expenses Domtar is paying to take on the 
inventories and accounts receivable at the four mills, which allow the 
company to get a favorable tax treatment on the deal as an asset purchase. 
For Georgia-Pacific, the sale of the mills in Ashdown, Ark., Nekoosa and Port 
Edwards, Wis., and Woodland, Maine, raises much-needed funds to pay down debt 
accumulated since it bought out Fort James Corp., a Deerfield, Ill.-based 
maker of consumer tissue brands, in July 2000 for $11 billion. 
The sale also rids the company of some assets that are subject to volatile 
price cycles. "It's a move to tie less assets to the white paper business," 
said Greg Guest, a spokesman for Georgia-Pacific. 
Georgia-Pacific is also selling two pulp mills in Brunswick, Ga., and New 
Augusta, Miss., and its specialty chemical unit, which makes formaldehyde and 
urea resins used to glue plywood and other building materials. 
Georgia-Pacific's specialty chemical business had drawn interest from 
Chicago-based Akzo Nobel Inc. and Borden Inc. 
The company said it will continue to operate four mills that make branded 
imaging, printing and publishing and specialty papers. 
Georgia-Pacific had previously put three mills, including the Woodland plant, 
up for sale. Although interested buyers included Enron Corp., 
Georgia-Pacific, which is under pressure to reduce its $14.8 billion debt, 
failed to reach a satisfactory deal with them. 
Of the four mills Domtar gets, the one in Ashdown is the crown jewel -- 
considered the best facility of its type in North America and the biggest of 
the four mills with capacity of 825,000 tons. 
Georgia-Pacific was advised by Carl Contigulia at Morgan Stanley, and Domtar 
by Kenneth Boone at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., with Debevoise & Plimpton as 
legal counsel.

Environmentalists, Texas company in dispute over power money
By DIANE SCARPONI
Associated Press Writer

06/04/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (AP) - Most people's monthly electricity bill includes a 
dollar or two to help people and businesses conserve energy. 
These dollars go into a conservation fund that last year added up to $85 
million. The money is spent by electric utilities to promote the use of 
insulation, power-thrifty appliances and other means to save power.
A new proposal to spend some of this public money has led to a huge fight 
among environmentalists, utilities, a global energy firm and a company whose 
technology could be as revolutionary as Edison's light bulb. 
The technology is a fuel cell, a kind of low-polluting, efficient power plant 
that generates electricity by an electrochemical process, instead of by 
simply burning fuel. 
Enron North America Corp., a subsidiary of Texas-based Enron Corp., is 
working with the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority to build a small 
fuel cell power farm. 
These partners want to take $125 million out of the conservation fund over 
five years to buy and install fuel cells from FuelCell Energy Inc. of 
Danbury. 
The fuel cells would generate about 26 megawatts a year - enough power to 
serve about 8,000 homes. The CRRA would sell the power. 
The technology - while still untested in commercial use - has the potential 
to revolutionize the way people and businesses get power. 
They also will satisfy Connecticut law to diversify the power mix and make 
Connecticut the fuel cell capital of the world, its supporters said. 
"It takes public funding to enable these technologies to come out of the 
space age and down to earth," said Jerry Leitman, chief executive and 
president of FuelCell Energy. 
Critics of this plan are attacking the deal from every angle. 
Enron, which rolled in $101 billion in revenues last year, bought $5 million 
worth of stock in FuelCell Energy in October. 
The company also has an agreement with FuelCell Energy to buy 55 megawatts 
worth of fuel cells over the next two years. If Enron does make the purchase, 
it gets an additional 1.3 million shares in FuelCell Energy. If not, Enron 
pays a penalty. 
Critics argue the plan would divert $125 million from proven energy 
conservation programs that last year saved 63 megawatts. 
And, they said, the conservation fund is not meant to be spent on alternative 
fuel technology, no matter how promising it may be. 
"To come in with a $100 billion company like Enron and use ratepayers' money 
to pay for the cost when they have sweetheart deal with FuelCell Energy - 
this is not the way the system is supposed to work," said Dan Sosland, 
executive director of Environment Northeast, a nonprofit group that sits on 
an advisory committee for the conservation fund. 
"If they think this is such a great thing, and if Enron made $100 billion 
last year, why are not putting up any of their own capital?" he asked. 
Enron, CRRA and FuelCell Energy reject the notion theirs is a sweetheart 
deal. 
CRRA, which operates trash-to-energy plants, wants to explore fuel cells as a 
way to use the gas that is produced from landfills, Robert Wright, the 
president of the quasi-public agency, told the DPUC. 
Connecticut law allows conservation fund money to be spent to develop fuel 
cells and other technologies as a way to improve the environment and 
encourage competition for electric customers, said Enron spokesman Eric 
Thode. 
"It fits perfectly with what conservation programs in Connecticut are trying 
to do," Thode said. 
Enron and the CRRA have asked the Department of Public Utility Control to 
approve their plan. 
If the project fails, Enron executives told the DPUC it would repay the 
conservation fund. If the project succeeds, it will improve the state's 
energy mix with a revolutionary technology from a homegrown company. 
Sosland noted that if the project succeeds, it will still generate less power 
than the state could have saved through existing conservation programs. If it 
succeeds, the Enron benefits financially. 
The agency has begun hearings into the proposal. Another hearing is scheduled 
for June 19, and a draft decision is due July 26. 
Enron is trying to take advantage of environmental provisions in the state's 
electric deregulation law. The law requires businesses that sell power in 
Connecticut to get a certain percentage of their power from renewable 
resources, such as wind or solar power. 
Fuel cells are also considered renewable, although they do use a fuel such as 
natural gas or methane. Unlike power plants that burn natural gas to generate 
power, fuel cells use chemical reactions with the gas to generate 
electricity. 
A 3-megawatt plant of fuel cells developed by FuelCell Energy is about the 
size of a tennis court and about one story high. It would serve about 900 
homes, or an office building, an apartment building a factory or some other 
use. 
Leitman also argued that the $125 million will help develop Connecticut's 
fuel cell industry and create jobs. 
"For the state of Connecticut to spend money to make Connecticut to fuel 
cells what Silicon Valley is to computer chips ... makes good sense," he said.

Newsprint Prices Seen Down As Weakness Persists In May
By Zahida Hafeez
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

06/04/2001
Dow Jones Commodities Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

CHICAGO --(Dow Jones)- With publishers still sitting on heavy inventories, 
summer won't be a pleasant one for newsprint producers, who have tried very 
hard in recent weeks to stick to their word on prices by maintaining supply 
discipline. 
April's weak newsprint consumption figures and projection of continuing 
softness in May have forced producers to invoice orders at prices discounted 
$10 to $20 a metric ton below the current list price of $635 a ton, experts 
note.
But although prices are expected to come down further as large publishers 
completely ignore large producers and hunt for even lower prices from 
alternative sources, more production cuts announced after the latest market 
data for April were released could temper the decline in prices. 
Following April data, which showed production slightly outpacing shipments, 
Abitibi-Consolidated Inc. (ABY) announced production cuts of 150,000 tons to 
be taken in the second quarter. This, on top of permanently removing 180,000 
tons from the market, completed the 400,000 tons of permanent cuts the 
largest newsprint-maker in the world promised when it bought Donohue Inc. 
last year. 
Norske Skog Canada Ltd. (NS.A) also announced it would cut production by 
24,000 tons by mid-July. 
What impact will these supply cuts have on the market? 
Because only roughly 80,000 tons of Abitibi's production cuts have so far 
materialized, estimates Reid Carter, analyst with National Bank Financial in 
Vancouver, the impact is restricted to buyer psychology. 
"This demonstrates that (Abitibi) is willing to do whatever it takes...and 
that's providing the base support for pricing," said Carter. 
Publishers indeed seem a little taken aback by the swift producer response. 
"(Abitibi's downtime plans) have gotten publishers sitting up and taking 
notice," conceded a purchasing executive at a Midwestern daily. "But 
publishers are curious to see if (the production cuts) will correct the 
market," he said, adding, "If there is still excess newsprint available, then 
publishers will push for a lower market." 
Slowing advertising lineage, which according to the latest data, fell 3.4% in 
March, is one reason for the publishers' firm conviction that prices will 
keep coming down. The other reason is the presence of a nontraditional supply 
source. 
Power marketer and provider of financial hedging instruments, Enron Corp. 
(ENE) has increased its presence in the pulp and paper arena, the publisher 
executive said, allowing publishers another newsprint source. As a result, 
some large publishers haven't bought much from the large producers, as the 
war between the two sides continues, the executive added. 
Moreover, some of the trends of a soft market, such as more tonnage being 
passed to brokers, extra effort by producers to increase exports and to 
funnel tonnage to secondary markets, are kicking into motion, market watchers 
said. 

May Newsprint Data Look Just As Weak As April's 

Total U.S. consumption, which fell 16.3% year-over-year in April, according 
to the Pulp and Paper Products Council, is expected to continue descending in 
May, National Bank's Carter said. The figures for May will be released in the 
last week of June. 
However, the recently announced production cuts will bring mill operating 
rates down to roughly 87% in May, Carter added. This compares to operating 
rates in April of 92%, which dropped from 96% in April, 2000. 
Carter also believes producer inventories will be flat so that total monthly 
inventories will be flat to lower, but not low enough to help prices. 
Analysts say more market-related downtime needs to occur to keep the market 
in shape. After all, inventory levels are currently 1.7%, or 30,000 tons 
above the 10-year average level for April of 1.815 million tons. 
In April, consumer inventories fell 24,000 tons, while on the mills end, they 
rose 23,000 tons for a combined total of 1.845 million tons, the PPPC said. 
"Producers other than Abitibi, Bowater and Norske Skog will have to take more 
downtime," said Stephen Atkinson, analyst with BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. in 
Montreal. He said the cuts so far have halted a price drop underway since 
March. 
But, Atkinson is self-admittedly more optimistic on newsprint prices and the 
strength of the market than are analysts in general. 
Mark Wilde, analyst with Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown in New York, said in a 
research note, "We do not believe that prices will stay at these levels for 
another month, but with continued supply discipline, producers may be able to 
hold prices until the seasonal pickup." Demand slows seasonally in the summer 
months and returns in September. 
Publishers, scoff at the notion of prices stabilizing. 
"If the price is coming down in March, April and May, what's it going to do 
in June and July when consumption historically falls?" said the Midwestern 
publisher's purchasing executive, who said inventory levels at his newspaper 
had risen considerably in May to 55 days of supply. "I'll be curbing 
shipments," the executive said. 
The PPPC's data show all U.S. users, including dailies, held 1.419 million 
tons of stocks, or the equivalent of 50 supply days in April, which is up one 
day from March and 12 days from the year-ago period.

Alliance for Retail Energy Markets Media Statement In Response to the 
Assembly Democratic Caucus' ``Fair Plan''

06/04/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)

SACRAMENTO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--June 4, 2001--Alliance for Retail Energy 
Markets (AReM) released the following statement today in response to media 
inquiries about the Assembly Democratic Caucus' recently proposed "Fair Plan" 
which provides an alternative policy blueprint to the Governor's Southern 
California Edison MOU. 
We are pleased to see that the Assembly Democrats are committed to finding a 
workable solution to California's energy crisis that includes restoring large 
users' access to the retail energy market. While the Caucus' proposal is a 
crucial first step and should be commended for recognizing the importance of 
creating a healthy retail market for California consumers, AReM must note two 
specific concerns with the proposed plan.
First, the plan fails to address small and residential customers' right to 
access the retail market. Certainly all consumers deserve the opportunity to 
take advantage of the benefits of retail energy options and to take control 
of their own energy futures. 
Second, the plan should not arbitrarily assign past debt costs to any one 
class. AReM suggests that any comprehensive solution be structured in a way 
that is fair for all parties. Any charges imposed to recover the costs of 
purchased power should be allocated to each customer group based on the costs 
that group has incurred. Without such fair allocations, the proposed plan may 
unintentionally create a barrier that discourages customers from utilizing 
the retail energy market altogether. 
The Alliance for Retail Energy Markets looks forward to working with the 
Caucus and the entire Legislature to incorporate a truly viable retail energy 
market policy into the comprehensive energy solution for California. 
Alliance for Retail Energy Markets (AReM) is a coalition whose member 
companies include AES NewEnergy, Inc., Commonwealth Energy Corp., Enron 
Energy Services, Inc., GreenMountain Energy Company, The New Power Company, 
Shell Energy Services, and Strategic Energy, L.L.C.

PBS Documentary Goes Inside the Utilities
Daryn Kagan

06/04/2001
CNN: Live This Morning
(c) Copyright eMediaMillWorks, Inc. (f/k/a Federal Document Clearing House, 
Inc.). All Rights Reserved.

The problems behind California's power crisis are the focus of a documentary 
on the PBS program "Frontline." The documentary looks at California's 
deregulation process, and how that will affect similar programs nationwide. 
DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: The problems behind California's power crisis are 
the focus of a documentary on the PBS program "Frontline." Here's a brief 
clip from the program called "Blackout."
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP, PBS' "BLACKOUT") 
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: We had had a problem with one unit going out at 1:30 in 
the morning. We immediately then into our reserves, pulled down hydro. It 
became evident that nobody had energy for us. 
(END VIDEO CLIP) 
KAGAN: And joining us from our Boston bureau to talk about the documentary is 
"Frontline" correspondent and producer Lowell Bergman. Lowell, good morning, 
good to see you. 
LOWELL BERGMAN, PRODUCER, "FRONTLINE": Good morning to you. 
KAGAN: To refresh our... 
BERGMAN: Good to see the lights on. 
KAGAN: Good to see we're working today. That's positive. Sometimes you just 
don't know. Our viewers might be more familiar with you. Your the guy who, in 
the movie "The Insider," Al Pacino portrayed as the producer who took on the 
tobacco industry. 
BERGMAN: I'm not Al Pacino. 
KAGAN: You're not Al Pacino, but accomplished in your own right, and as a 
reporter, a journalist who really likes to take on tough, difficult topics, 
like the tobacco industry, like the drug wars, a previous "Frontline" 
documentary, and now, the power companies. How does that compare to previous 
topics? 
BERGMAN: Well, this is really a subject that touches everyone's lives. As you 
know, when you wake up in the morning and you turn on your radio, you expect 
the electricity to be on or your television to go on. What happens when that 
doesn't happen? And why is that happening now in place like California, and 
also why are your bills going up. You're pretty lucky, actually, where you 
are. Your electricity bills are probably pretty stable. That's because you 
haven't deregulated yet. That is, they haven't tried to restructure the 
marketplace. KAGAN: You haven't see our natural gas bills. Our natural gas 
bills here in Atlanta have gone -- we've had taste of that. 
BERGMAN: Well, that's part of the documentary. Natural gas has usually been 
set up as the example, the deregulation example for the rest of the country, 
and the reason why we started to deregulate electricity. Now, with the great 
rise in cost nationally, people are beginning to scratch their heads, and I 
think that's one of the reasons we decided to do the show is because we never 
really had what we would call an intense national discussion of why were we 
doing this to these essential commodities that we all need. 
KAGAN: Well, let's talk about the deregulation. Story after story in 
California, you have people blaming deregulation. But what really is it, and 
what was it supposed to do and what went wrong? 
BERGMAN: Well, first of all, California went first, in 1996 with a plan that 
now everyone is disowning, but everyone voted in favor of unanimously at the 
time. Every political spectrum joined in wanting to change the nature of the 
marketplace. So, in many ways, California is a learning experience for the 
rest of the country, probably in some of the rules that don't make sense or 
in the end, didn't make sense. 
KAGAN: Why did it seem like a good idea back then? I mean, if all the people 
were in favor of it, then it must have looked good to a lot of people. 
BERGMAN: Well, because number one, the utilities were never our favorite 
monopoly in any of our communities. You know about Homer Simpson and "Erin 
Brockovich" and the image isn't exactly of companies that warm our heart. 
That combined with large users of electricity, big industry wanted to change 
the system so they would have an opportunity to go out in the open 
marketplace and buy power cheaper or so they thought. 
KAGAN: You mention, of course, that this is a story that touches all of us, 
anybody who electricity on in their home, unless it's like the folks that we 
featured before you who have their own power source. But how do you take 
that, Lowell, and how do you make it a good television story besides a bunch 
of pictures of power plants? 
BERGMAN: Well, what we found, what we discovered is that the deregulation of 
the industry has created a new kind of energy company, and the best example 
of that is Enron, based in Houston, Texas, and they were nice enough and 
cooperative in every way. So, they let us in to see what it is they do do. 
What is this new new energy business. 
For instance, Enron is the largest Internet business in the world. It has 
Enron Online, and on that site, it buys and sells tens of billions of dollars 
worth of electricity, gas and oil every year. This is a kind of marketplace 
that never existed before. So, one of the functions of a documentary is to 
try to open not only our eyes, the people doing it, the reporters, but also 
the public's eyes as to what has gone on. This is something that is 
well-known inside business communities nationally, but it's not well-known 
among most of us. So, that's one area. Another area that we get into is 
examining whether or not there was real manipulation by the energy generators 
in California, and nationally as well as the gas companies. 
KAGAN: Well, we will look for it. We will look for it tomorrow, sorry. The 
power on our interview here is running out. We ran out of time. Lowell 
Bergman, good luck with it. Most viewers will find it on their PBS station 
tomorrow night, correct? 
BERGMAN: Thank you. It will be -- check your local listings. 
KAGAN: Check your local listings, as they say, and check the electricity bill 
as well. Lowell Bergman, thanks for joining. 
BERGMAN: Thank you.

Bush Aide, Ethics Agency Differ Over Stock Sale Delay (Update1)

Bush Aide, Ethics Agency Differ Over Stock Sale Delay (Update1)

     (Adds Womack comments in fifth-10th paragraphs.)

     Washington, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- The White House and the
federal Office of Government Ethics differed over what was
delaying the sale of stock by President George W. Bush's top
political strategist Karl Rove.
     Rove said he has been waiting months for ethics office
approval of a document that would let him avoid capital-gains
taxes on his sale of stock in more than two dozen companies that
could present a conflict of interest.
     An ethics office spokesman said today Rove hasn't submitted a
request for such a document, called a ``certificate of
divestiture,'' which normally takes only a few days to process.
     Rove's financial disclosure form, which was released by the
White House last week, does contain a notation, dated May 18 and
initialed by an ethics officer, that states ``all individual stock
holdings to be sold.''
     Rove said he's been waiting for approval from the ethics
office to sell all of his stock holdings, White House spokeswoman
Anne Womack said.
     ``Mr. Rove was willing to divest himself in December, but was
advised by the White House counsel's office he should not do so
until they reviewed his holdings and determined the best course of
action to avoid any conflict of interest,'' White House
spokeswoman Anne Womack said.

                     Skipping Some Discussions

     In the meantime, Rove said he's been skipping discussions
that could have a direct impact on his stocks, Womack said. ``He
told me, `There have been conversations I just walked away
from,''' Womack said.
     The Wall Street Journal reported this morning that Rove said
he'd been waiting for several months for ethics office approval to
sell his stock holdings and put the proceeds into a diversified
account. The ethics office said it's the responsibility of the
government official to request a certificate of divestiture.
     Womack said a draft of Rove's divestiture paperwork was sent
in ``mid to late April'' to the Office of Government Ethics, and
Rove has yet to receive guidance back from the agency.
     Rove is ``trying to get this done in a timely way,'' Womack
said. ``This is really a paperwork issue at this point.''
     The disclosure form shows Rove owning assets valued at from
$2.3 million to $5.6 million, based on the broad ranges of values
used for such forms. Many of the companies do business with the
U.S. government or could be affected by policies emanating from
the White House.

                         Biggest Holdings

     Rove owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron
Corp., the biggest energy trader and owner of U.S. interstate
pipelines, according to the disclosure form. He has similar
amounts of stock in Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co.,
Cisco Systems Inc., American Express Co., Sallie Mae, Intel Corp.,
Wells Fargo & Co., and Johnson & Johnson. He also reported smaller
holdings in a dozen other companies and in 10 funds.
     Since taking office, Rove has seen the value of many of his
stocks decline. Enron has fallen about 23 percent since Bush took
office in January; American Express has dropped 8 percent; Cisco
has slid about 51 percent; and Intel has dipped 15 percent.
     Boeing shares have climbed about 19 percent since January,
while Johnson & Johnson has risen 6 percent.




Marathon Gets Enron's 20% Stake in Saudi Gas Project (Update1)

Marathon Gets Enron's 20% Stake in Saudi Gas Project (Update1)

     (Adds Exxon Mobil's, Occidental's shares of the project in
second paragraph.)

     Houston, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- USX-Marathon Group, the fourth-
biggest U.S. oil company, got Enron Corp.'s 20 percent stake in a
project that's part of a $25 billion natural-gas venture in Saudi
Arabia.
     Marathon will join project leader Exxon Mobil Corp. and
Occidental Petroleum Corp. in the ``Red Sea Consortium,'' Marathon
spokesman Roger Holliday said. Exxon Mobil will have a 60 percent
stake, and Occidental will hold 20 percent, Exxon Mobil
spokeswoman Suzanne McCarron said.
     The three companies joined the Royal Dutch/Shell Group, BP
Plc, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc. and Phillips Petroleum Co. in a
signing ceremony in Saudi Arabia Sunday for three projects, the
first gas-exploration business offered to international companies
in 20 years. The gas business may give the companies a lead over
rivals if Saudi Arabia lets international companies develop crude-
oil reserves.
     Details are still being negotiated. The companies are
expected to spend $17 billion on the biggest project and about $4
billion on another. The size of the Red Sea project still is
unclear, Holliday said.
     ``My understanding is there's exploration involved, and the
final scope of the project will be determined later,'' he said.
     Enron said Friday it had pulled out of the venture, though it
may provide services under a separate contract with Occidental. A
company spokesman declined to say why Enron backed out. Enron has
moved away from large infrastructure projects to focus on trading
electricity, gas and other commodities.
     Marathon and Enron, the biggest energy trader and a pipeline
company, are based in Houston. Exxon Mobil, the world's biggest
publicly traded oil company, is based in Irving, Texas.
Occidental, a U.S. oil and gas producer, is based in Los Angeles.
     Saudi Arabia wants to convert its oil-powered utilities to
run on cheaper natural gas. The country has had budget deficits
for most of the past two decades and needs international
investments to proceed with the projects.
     Shares of Marathon rose 57 cents to $32.72. Enron rose $1.50
to $54.54.

Bush vs. price caps: Economists correct a faulty power lecture


(Published June 5, 2001)=20

In his recent commencement address at Yale University, President Bush salut=
ed=20
the C students in the graduating class: "I say you, too, can be president o=
f=20
the United States." But when he lectured California last week on the evils =
of=20
electricity price controls, the joke seemed less funny. What America's most=
=20
famous C student didn't learn in economics class is costing the state dearl=
y.=20
"Price caps do nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase=20
supply," Bush said in his Los Angeles address, repeating a standard lesson=
=20
out of introductory economics textbooks. Unfortunately, as 10 energy=20
economists from universities around the nation made clear last week in an=
=20
open letter on the state's electricity crisis, Bush must have missed the=20
later chapters.=20
The textbooks' admonitions against price controls apply to competitive=20
markets. When competition breaks down, giving one or a few producers the=20
ability to control prices, the textbooks are equally firm that regulation i=
s=20
needed to keep them from exploiting consumers.=20
That's the situation confronting California -- and federal regulators.=20
Electricity markets here long ago ceased to be competitive. Because of a=20
flawed market structure and a temporary imbalance between supply and demand=
,=20
generators learned last year that they had market power: By withholding=20
supply at key times and places, they drove up the price of power beyond the=
=20
level that would otherwise prevail in a competitive market.=20
"We cannot expect a market to operate to benefit consumers ... if effective=
=20
competition does not exist," the economists said in their letter. "In this=
=20
case, cost-of-service prices are an obvious remedy."=20
They noted that several useful proposals have been submitted to the Federal=

Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) for temporary price restraints on=20
wholesale prices. These would last only until new plants now being built co=

Such restraints could meet the federal legal requirement that prices be "ju=

SACRAMENTO -- California's electricity production should improve in the nex=

maintenance shutdowns, the state's grid operator said yesterday.=20
That, coupled with conservation efforts detailed by state officials Sunday,=

"We still find blackouts are inevitable," said Michael Zenker of Cambridge=

Energy Research Associates, an energy research and consulting organization.=
=20
"There just isn't enough generation available."=20

By the middle of this month, every existing plant is scheduled to be=20
producing power. That contrasts with a historic high this spring when about=
 a=20
third of the state's power generation was unavailable due to scheduled or=

Gov. Gray Davis ordered inspectors into plants to make sure generators=20
weren't cheating.=20
Generators objected, saying they have run their plants so hard since last=
=20
year that routine maintenance was overdue, which caused more unplanned=20
breakdowns.=20
The Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid, says equipment=
=20
breakdowns typically account for about 2,500 megawatts being off-line on an=

The power grid was short 4,144 megawatts due to planned shutdowns yesterday=

More generation, however, "doesn't mean consumers can cut back on their=20

That, coupled with conservation efforts detailed by state officials Sunday,=

id=20
=01) but not enough to stave off blackouts.=20
"We still find blackouts are inevitable," said Michael Zenker of Cambridge=
=20
Energy Research Associates, an energy research and consulting organization.=
=20
"There just isn't enough generation available."=20
By mid-June, every existing plant is scheduled to be producing power. That=
=20
contrasts with a historic high this spring when about a third of the state'=
s=20
power generation was unavailable due to scheduled or emergency shutdowns.=
=20
The high number of shuttered plants prompted state officials to suggest pow=
er=20
generators were deliberately withholding electricity to drive up prices, an=
d=20
Gov. Gray Davis to order inspectors into plants to make sure generators=20
weren't cheating.=20
Generators objected, saying they have run their plants so hard since last=
=20
year that routine maintenance was overdue, which caused more unplanned=20
breakdowns.=20
Last Thursday, for instance, when California came within a hair of a sevent=
h=20
day of statewide blackouts, one of Duke Energy's 750-megawatt Moss Landing=
=20
units began springing boiler leaks.=20
"We almost lost it that day because we'd been putting off scheduled=20
maintenance for so long," said company spokesman Tom Williams. "You can nur=
se=20
those along for a while, but after a while they'll trip (off-line) and=20
they'll do it during the peak of the summer."=20
The Independent System Operator, which runs the power grid, says equipment=
=20
breakdowns typically account for about 2,500 megawatts being off-line on an=
y=20
given day. Forced outages stripped the power grid of 2,673 megawatts Monday=
.=20
The power grid was short 4,144 megawatts due to planned shutdowns Monday,=
=20
beating the Independent System Operator's projections that 5,800 megawatts=
=20
would be unavailable. That was down from 9,800 megawatts off-line for=20
scheduled maintenance when the state narrowly avoided rolling blackouts=20
Thursday.=20
By comparison, California was expected to use about 31,000 megawatts of pow=
er=20
during its afternoon peak period Monday, and top out at about 31,800=20
megawatts Tuesday afternoon. The 4,144 megawatts unavailable due to planned=
=20
shutdowns Monday would have powered about 3.1 million homes.=20
The ISO projects that in a week, about 3,000 megawatts should be down for=
=20
maintenance, said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. "It looks like we're =
on=20
target with our goal of getting the planned maintenance down to zero by=20
mid-June."=20
More generation, however, "doesn't mean consumers can cut back on their=20
conservation, because at the same time more plants come on line, temperatur=

continue to rise," McCorkle said. By summer's peak in August and September,=
=20
California can be using more than 45,000 megawatts.=20
Californians cut their electricity use by 11 percent overall, and by about =
10=20

=20
year, the California Energy Commission said Sunday. In addition, the Davis=

power is falling.=20
"All that's good news. We're moving in the right direction," said Severin=

Planned maintenance shutdowns this winter and spring helped prompt six days=

"The idea is the plants go down mainly in the springtime, because usually=

PG&E's creditors have agreed to management's plan to shower top executives=
=20
with $17.5 million in bonuses but balked at the bankrupt utility's initial=
=20
demand that the cash come with no strings attached, The Chronicle has=20

Instead, the creditors say they forced Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to link=

quickly filing a Chapter 11 reorganization plan, no later than January.=20
However, PG&E spokesman Ron Low insisted yesterday that the utility had=20
always intended for the bonuses to be tied to submitting a reorganization=

"Our original proposal closely resembled what was filed with the court," he=

said.=20
The bonuses are expected to figure prominently when PG&E's management holds=

court-mandated meeting with creditors on Thursday in San Francisco.=20
Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali, who has the final say on all compensation=

questions, is scheduled to issue a ruling June 18.=20
Critics have slammed the utility's "management retention program" as an=20
unwarranted payout to the same executive team responsible for steering PG&E=
=20
into its worst-ever financial crisis.=20
But the company insists that without extra incentives, corporate leaders=20
would depart and thus slow PG&E's return to creditworthiness.=20
"It's a question of efficiency," said Allan Marks, a lawyer representing th=
e=20
11 companies comprising the creditors' committee in PG&E's bankruptcy=20
proceedings.=20
"It's not a question of whether these people are good or bad managers," he=
=20
said. "It's simply more efficient to keep these people in place."=20
Marks said that when PG&E first proposed the bonuses last month, the=20
creditors' committee quickly noted that the cash was a virtual handout to=
=20
about 226 top executives.=20
PG&E Chairman Robert Glynn and nearly two dozen other senior managers would=
=20
receive 100 percent of their salaries to stay on, while hundreds of other=

employees would receive bonuses of between 25 and 75 percent of their=20

After what Marks described as candid negotiations, he said PG&E had agreed =

by the beginning of 2002.=20
"This is one way that we can assure efficiency in the process," he said. "O=
ur=20
goal is to make sure the company operates as quickly as possible."=20
But PG&E's Low said that the creditors had actually requested only minor=20
changes in wording and that the timing of a reorganization plan had never=

really been in dispute.=20
A reorganization plan is the blueprint for a company's eventual recovery fr=
om=20

Glynn would receive a bonus of 100 percent of his $900,000 annual salary if=
=20
PG&E's plan is submitted on time. If he misses the deadline, he would have =
to=20
make do with just two-thirds of that amount.=20
While there is no reason to believe that PG&E's managers would have dragged=
=20
their heels without piles of extra cash, Marks said it was common in=20
bankruptcy cases for corporate leaders to receive an incentive to remain in=
=20
their jobs and seek a resolution to the company's difficulties.=20
"We ended up with something that we think is fair," he said.=20
The creditors' committee includes financial heavyweights Bank of America an=

Merrill Lynch, as well as power giants Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc. The=20

Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights =

he=20
creditors' committee had signaled that it would agree to almost anything th=

would help them recover outstanding costs.=20
"The creditors are in this to get reimbursed fully," he said. "Their idea i=

to ultimately soak ratepayers for the entire cost of the bankruptcy."=20
Marks said the creditors would seek nothing less than full payment of PG&E'=

Sacramento -- Saying it is being shortchanged, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.=

filed suit yesterday challenging the amount of money California will get fr=

consumers as reimbursement for buying electricity.=20
The suit filed with the state appellate court in San Francisco claims that=

the California Public Utilities Commission is giving the state too big a=20
share of the monthly revenue collected from consumers -- all at PG&E's=20
expense.=20
The suit by PG&E was expected. If the utility wins, it could make it harder=
=20
and longer for the state to recoup its power purchases.=20
The state stepped in to purchase wholesale electricity for the utilities=20
after their credit soured as power costs skyrocketed. The state has spent=
=20
more than $7 billion so far with reimbursement expected from consumers.=20
Earlier, Southern California Edison filed a similar legal challenge.=20
At issue is the amount of money the utilities receive from consumers and th=
e=20
amount given to the state to cover electricity purchases.=20
PG&E contends that the PUC's calculation puts the utility $2.2 billion in t=
he=20
hole because state regulators underestimated the cost of running the nuclea=
r=20
power plant at Diablo Canyon and the cost of contracts with alternative=20
energy producers, like solar and wind generators.=20
The utility wants its share of consumer revenue increased, leaving less for=
=20
the state.=20
Under a bill lawmakers passed in January, it was the calculation of how muc=
h=20
of consumer money was needed to reimburse the state for energy purchases th=
at=20
would dictate how many bonds the state could sell to repay itself.=20
The limit on bond sales was four times that calculation, totaling about $13=
=20
billion.=20
But both utilities challenged the PUC's initial decision, saying it was too=
=20

Fearing legal action from the utilities, lawmakers passed a second bill in=

May that delinked the authorization to sell up to $13.4 billion in bonds fr=
om=20
the calculation of how much consumer money the utilities receive.=20
That bill allows the bond sale to happen as early as Aug. 14.=20
As a result, yesterday the Davis administration and State Treasurer Phil=20

Critics say Calpine plan too generous=20
Posted at 10:35 p.m. PDT Monday, June 4, 2001=20
BY MIKE ZAPLER=20

Mercury News=20


In what would be a highly unusual break for a local business, San Jose=20
officials are proposing to rewrite city law and spend tens of millions in=
=20
taxpayer funds to ease construction of Calpine's controversial power plant =
in=20
Coyote Valley.=20
The provisions highlight just how far the city has come on Calpine's propos=
ed=20
600-megawatt Metcalf Energy Center. Just months ago, city leaders stood in=
=20
solid opposition to the $400 million project, threatening lawsuits and othe=
r=20
tactics to block it. Now, those same officials appear ready to go to=20
extraordinary lengths to make Metcalf happen.=20
Part of an agreement reached last week by Mayor Ron Gonzales and the compan=
y=20
would require the city to pay $50 million upfront to extend a recycled-wate=
r=20
pipeline needed to cool the power plant. Calpine will reimburse San Jose fo=
r=20
just $10 million of that cost, far less than the city had sought, and will=
=20
make its payments over 30 years.=20
Another clause would allow Calpine, which reported an increase in=20
first-quarter profits of more than 400 percent, to spread over 10 years a=
=20
$3.9 million sewer connection fee. That would be a first for the city.=20
Typically those levies are collected upfront; the city council would have t=
o=20
amend a law that set a five-year limit on sewer connection payments.=20
``I'm not comfortable with that,'' said Councilman and Metcalf opponent=20
Forrest Williams, whose District 2 would be home to Metcalf. ``They're a ve=
ry=20
profitable company .?.?. they should pay the connection fee.''=20
Councilwoman Pat Dando said the overall agreement, set to be considered by=
=20
the council this afternoon, is probably the best the city could do under th=
e=20
circumstances. But she added: ``I believe Calpine's payment should be the=
=20
same as other businesses that develop in San Jose.''=20
The money for the pipeline would come from a fund to expand and increase th=
e=20
reliability of the entire recycled-water system. Projects the city had=20
planned to build sooner would have to be delayed, but the water pollution=
=20
control plant would not raise rates to pay for the Metcalf extension,=20
environmental services director Carl Mosher said.=20
Company at advantage=20
The criticized provisions are part of a larger package settled on after=20
roughly five weeks of negotiations. The talks occurred in a political=20
atmosphere that heavily favored the power company: Gov. Gray Davis endorsed=
=20
Metcalf in April, and the California Energy Commission is widely expected=
=20
this month to override the city's November denial of the plant.=20
Mayor Ron Gonzales and Calpine executives defended the deal, saying its=20
unusual terms were tailored to a unique project.=20
Metcalf, they said, would become the city's biggest customer of recycled=20
water, consuming an average of 3 million gallons daily -- or nearly one-thi=
rd=20
of the current total usage -- to cool the plant. That would help the city=
=20
achieve its goal of reducing freshwater usage and diverting more water from=
=20
the San Francisco Bay for ecological reasons.=20
And the city would receive other concessions from Calpine, supporters say,=
=20
including two extra air-monitoring stations and $6.5 million mostly for par=
ks=20
and open space.=20
``The energy crisis requires us to do business differently than we have in=
=20
the past,'' Gonzales said. ``When you take the entire package it's a win-wi=
n=20
for the city.''=20
Critics, while acknowledging that Calpine had a commanding position at the=
=20
bargaining table, say the city still is giving up too much. They questioned=
=20

in the near future.=20
The city entered negotiations with Calpine wanting the company to cover the=

entire $50 million cost of the pipeline extension, a senior city official=
=20
said. Others involved in the negotiations say that was never officially=20
broached by the city, although Calpine development manager Ken Abreu=20
acknowledged that ``obviously the city would have been happy for us to pay=

for as much of the pipeline as possible.''=20
That's what the city should be demanding, said Issa Ajlouny, a resident of=

Early last year, according to city officials and transcripts of a Californi=

recycled-water line if the power plant were built. If San Jose decided to=

construct a larger pipeline to serve more customers, the city would make up=

the difference.=20

But that informal arrangement fell apart when Metcalf emerged as a major=20
political battle. Gonzales came out against the plant in June 2000, and the=
=20
council went on to vote against it in November.=20
By the time the negotiations began, Calpine didn't really need the city's=
=20
help. All indications were that the California Energy Commission would=20
override the city and approve the plant anyway.=20
What emerged from the talks was a $10 million payment, spread over 30 years=
,=20
from Calpine for the recycled-water line. Company officials say that 20=20
percent is roughly the same share of the pipeline capacity Metcalf would us=

The other 80 percent has yet to be allocated, but officials said they hope =

``Our perspective is we're doing what's fair,'' Calpine's Abreu said.=20
As the agreement heads to the council this afternoon, some neighborhood=20

today's shortage of capacity has made it possible for energy companies,=20

''It really strains credulity to say this is a functioning market,'' said=
=20
Representative Joe Barton, Republican of Texas, who as chairman of the Hous=
e=20
energy subcommittee has been leaning on the Federal Energy Regulatory=20
Commission to scrutinize the California gas market. ''Reasonable people cou=
ld=20
conclude people have gamed the system.''=20
In one significant case, California utility regulators and Southern=20
California Edison, one of the state's struggling electric utilities, have=
=20
accused the El Paso Corporation of using its control of a major pipeline in=
to=20
the state to inflate prices artificially. El Paso officials deny wrongdoing=
=20
and accuse California officials of making the company a scapegoat for the=
=20
state's failure to build more pipelines. A judge at the federal energy=20
commission is hearing the case in Washington.=20
But fingers are pointing in other directions, too.=20
For example, the Southern California Gas Company, the state's largest gas=
=20
utility, has reaped huge profits buying and selling gas in the last year --=
=20
activity encouraged by state regulations intended to lower gas prices for=
=20
consumers. But some gas marketers and electricity generators contend that t=

trading has contributed to price spikes, by tying up valuable pipeline spac=
e=20
during peak times with gas shipments driven by financial deals, not power=
=20
demands.=20
At the same time, Edison says that Southern California Gas failed to put=20
enough gas into storage last fall for residential and small-business=20
customers. If so, that would have driven the gas company back into the mark=
et=20
in the winter, when demand from power plant operators was high, helping pus=
h=20
gas -- and hence electricity -- prices yet higher, Edison complains.=20
Between them, El Paso and Southern California Gas were responsible for $3.7=
=20
billion in excess prices for energy in the last year, Edison contends.=20
Southern California Gas, a unit of Sempra Energy, denies that its trading h=
as=20
harmed the market. Rather, its executives note that electricity generators=
=20
and industrial gas consumers -- which under state rules are responsible for=
=20
managing their own gas supplies -- put very little gas into storage last=20
year. By one estimate, large gas consumers in Southern California had only =
11=20
percent as much gas in storage at the end of November as they did at the sa=
me=20
time during the prior two years.=20
Another problem may emerge this summer, according to William L. Massey, a=
=20
member of the federal energy commission. Mr. Massey said new commission rul=
es=20
intended to limit electricity price spikes in California will almost=20
certainly prompt energy-trading companies -- which deal in both gas and=20
electricity -- to manipulate gas prices. That is because the rules allow=20
electricity generators to charge more if gas prices move higher.=20
Similarly, growing attention is being paid to the role played by financial=
=20
trading tied to the price of electricity and natural gas. Industry critics=
=20
question whether huge trading volumes in these financial derivatives gives=
=20
energy marketing companies the incentive to manipulate prices in tight=20
markets.=20
Federal regulators ''don't seem to understand that firms are really trying =
to=20
make as much money as they can,'' said Severin Borenstein, director of the=
=20
University of California Energy Institute, a research organization on the=
=20
Berkeley campus. ''That's what they do for a living.''=20
Fixing the problem is simple, Mr. Borenstein said. ''If you build more=20
capacity,'' he said, ''you reduce both the scarcity issue and you reduce th=
e=20
ability of people who currently own capacity to exercise market power.''=20
Regardless of whether companies are manipulating prices, the California=20
natural gas market is fattening bottom lines. In the El Paso case, testimon=
y=20
has shown that pipeline capacity acquired by the company's marketing=20
affiliate in March 2000 for $38.5 million produced profits of almost $900=
=20
million over the next 13 months.=20
El Paso said its share of those profits was $184 million, the rest going to=
=20
other companies with which it entered into hedging transactions intended to=
=20
limit El Paso's exposure if gas prices fell. About half of those transactio=
ns=20
were with the biggest energy trader, the Enron Corporation, according to=20
people present at briefings El Paso officials have given to California=20
officials.=20
An Enron spokesman, Mark Palmer, said it was possible that Enron took the=
=20
other side of the trades, but he said that Enron would have resold the=20
pipeline capacity almost immediately, thus profiting little from the rise o=
f=20
gas prices in California.=20
Federal regulators, concerned that the high gas prices in California may no=

o=20

=20
whether to reimpose price caps on short-term sales of pipeline capacity tha=
t=20

Further, regulators are scrutinizing the so-called gray market in which=20
energy marketers bundle gas and transmission capacity and sell it to large=
=20
customers, like electricity generators, for one price. Federal regulators=
=20
have oversight responsibility for the interstate portion of gas shipments,=
=20
but they have not looked closely at these bundled transactions, Mr. Massey=
=20
said.=20
''The whole thing has fallen through the cracks,'' he said.=20
Nearly all of California's gas comes from the Southwest, the Rocky Mountain=
=20
states and Canada through a few huge, highly pressurized pipelines. In=20
California, the gas is shunted onto intrastate pipelines that deliver it to=
=20
consumers and to underground storage fields for later use.=20
Those pipelines are now largely running full, and their capacity is about 3=
00=20
million cubic feet a day less than what interstate pipelines can deliver. T=
he=20
difference is the amount of gas it takes to continuously fuel a 1,300=20

''It's not resources, it's straws -- the straws needed to suck this gas whe=

as it was in the mid-1990's.=20
Likewise, Southern California Gas plans only limited expansion of its=20

Grid Lock Our energy transport system is horrible. Just the way many 
utilities like it.

Our energy transport system is balkanized and horribly inefficient. 
Unfortunately, many of the incumbent utilities want to keep it that way. 
The Bush energy plan hits hard on increasing production. That alone won't 
solve the nation's power crunch. "Supply is not the only issue," says 
Michelle Michot Soss, director of the Energy Institute at the University of 
Houston. "The issue is bottlenecks."
Some of these bottlenecks are political. A lot of them are created by 
incumbent utilities that do not welcome competition. 
Florida, for example, whose demand for electricity is growing at about 3.7% a 
year, is a net importer of energy. It generates around 24% of its power in 
aging oil-fired plants that should be replaced with more efficient 
combined-cycle generators. These burn natural gas in a turbine and use the 
hot exhaust gases to create steam, which spins a second turbine; they spew 
out less particulate and consume about a third less energy. 
So why doesn't Florida get efficient power plants? First, the state has only 
one main gas pipeline, though others are working their way through the 
regulatory process. More vexing is a state law, zealously defended by Florida 
utilities, that bans outside competitors from building combined-cycle plants 
larger than 75 megawatts--enough to juice 75,000 households--on the dubious 
theory that they waste water. Duke Energy tried to challenge the law with a 
500-megawatt plant in New Smyrna Beach. FPL Corp. (parent of Florida Power & 
Light) fought the plant all the way to the Florida Supreme Court and won. 
Florida's screwy power-plant law is just one example of the byzantine 
regulations that stymie efforts to make the nation's energy grid more 
efficient and prices more competitive. From laws that protect utilities 
against more efficient rivals to outdated state regulations that discourage 
the construction of transmission lines, these choke points either waste 
energy or make it impossible for energy to get where it should go. 
A series of state laws in the 1920s laid down the monopolies on grids. They 
were codified in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, a populist 
law that identified bigness with badness in the electricity business: To 
avoid federal scrutiny and regulation, most utilities decided not to operate 
outside their own state boundaries; rate setting fell to the states. But even 
as wholesale electricity markets have been deregulated, utilities can still 
bat away outsiders by reserving their own transmission lines for "native 
load." This allows them to keep an open lane on the energy highway, as it 
were, to rush electricity to certain customers when their demand suddenly 
spikes. 
In such areas as the Southeast, the owner of a transmission line has a pretty 
free hand in calculating what its native load is. So Southern Co., which owns 
utilities in Georgia and four neighboring states, can determine how much 
power to let into its territory. 
Southern Co. defends the rule, saying its primary job is ensuring customers 
get all the power they need. "The marketers would like to schedule another 
10,000 megawatts of power to go across our lines tomorrow," says William 
Newman, a senior vice president. "It's not going to happen. The system wasn't 
designed for it." 
Enron disagrees. Utilization of its natural gas pipeline system increased 50% 
in the five years after the gas market was deregulated. Steven Kean, head of 
government regulations at the Houston-based giant, thinks similar gains are 
possible in electricity if companies like Southern are forced to hand over 
control of the grid to independent regional boards that will determine how to 
allocate power flows and where to build new lines. The utilities "don't want 
to accept the economically pure solution," he says. "Once utilities have been 
adequately compensated for their stranded costs, then it's time for them to 
shut up, sit in the corner and let the economists and lawyers work out the 
details." 
Lawyers and economists making decisions for us? That doesn't sound like 
deregulation. But there is a case to be made for separating control of power 
lines from control of other utility assets. Phillip G. Harris is chief 
executive of PJM (it stood for Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland), a regional 
power line organization. Since this independent system operator was formed in 
April 1997 and six local utilities ceded control over transmission lines, 
reliability has gone up and prices down, he says. Where Southern Co. will 
only add transmission capacity if it has a firm contract in hand, PJM can 
order lines to be built. Its member companies are spending $311 million over 
the next three years on new lines to increase the flow from power-rich to 
energy-poor areas. 
Last May temperatures hit the highest levels since 1930 at the same time as 
15,000 megawatts of PJM's 59,000 megawatts were out of service for 
maintenance. As the peak load rose to 51,000 megawatts--7,000 more than was 
available within PJM--power streamed in over a dozen entry points. Prices 
topped out at $432 a megawatt hour. That's about four times what you are 
probably paying for residential service, but it stands in contrast to spikes 
in the thousands of dollars in California and the Midwest during similar 
crises. 
Unfortunately, what works inside PJM doesn't transfer to Los Angeles, much 
less to Manhattan. Different rules regarding electricity transactions and a 
shortage of transmission lines make it difficult to export electricity across 
the Hudson River. When Hydro-Quebec tried to build a power line across Long 
Island Sound in 1999, Connecticut nixed the idea. Ostensible reason: the 
possibility of harm to oyster beds. Real reason: Folks in New Haven asked, 
what's in it for us--and didn't see any clear benefit to them. There is, 
unfortunately, no mechanism for buying off losers in these deals, such as 
property owners near, but not under, the power line. So they hire lawyers and 
talk solemnly about oysters. 
California's bottleneck is on Path 15, a 500,000-volt transmission line that 
links the northern and southern halves of the state. Path 15 can't 
accommodate the flows of power needed when the weather is cool in San 
Francisco and hot in L.A. But the legal and financial chaos in California, 
with the state on the verge of taking over much of the transmission system, 
discourages investors from backing an increase in capacity. "If we put in 
good rules on how to operate transmission systems, you would see investment," 
says Lawrence Makovich, an analyst with Cambridge Energy Research Associates. 
"The problem is right now there is no such plan." 
Enron is trying to force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take 
charge, so far to little avail. In a case pending before the U.S. Supreme 
Court, Enron accuses FERC of abdicating its responsibility to do for 
interstate trading of electricity what it did for trading of gas. 
But forcing FERC down that path will be difficult. Natural gas producers 
needed interstate pipelines to get to big markets in the North, which needed 
the gas. But incumbent (and politically connected) electric companies have no 
such incentive to stimulate a national market in electricity. "There's not a 
single incentive in the entire U.S. to relieve congestion," states Jeanine 
Hull, president of Strategic Energy Advisors and a former power-company 
lawyer. "Ask yourself this question: If you had a chance today to retain your 
monopoly or compete, which would you choose?"

US Sen. Feinstein Urges Hearings On FERC 'Improprieties'

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called Friday 
for Senate hearings to investigate "possible improprieties" involving the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's relations with the industry it 
regulates. 
"Despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity 
and natural gas markets in California and the West, and a finding by FERC 
last November of 'unjust and unreasonable' (electricity) rates, the 
commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and 
stability to the marketplace," Feinstein said in a letter to Sen. Joe 
Lieberman, D-Conn., seeking hearings by the Senate Governmental Affairs 
Committee.
Feinstein cited a report in The New York Times Friday in which FERC Chairman 
Curt Hebert related a phone conversation with Ken Lay, chairman of Enron 
Corp. (ENE). Hebert alleged that Lay offered to bring his influence to bear 
with the Bush administration to maintain Hebert as chairman if the regulator 
would adopt policy positions favored by Enron. 
Hebert is quoted as saying he was "offended" by the conversation. Lay 
disputed Hebert's account. 
The Times article also quoted Vice President Dick Cheney as saying Texas 
utility regulator Pat Wood has "got to be the next chairman of the FERC" to 
address problems in electricity markets. Cheney's remark is slated for 
broadcast by the public television program "Frontline." 
"While Mr. Lay's account (of the conversation) differs, it is clear that the 
citizens of the United States, especially the people of California, who are 
suffering from FERC's failure to do its job, deserve an investigation and 
full public hearing into what happened," Feinstein said in the letter to 
Lieberman. 
"FERC is a $175 million-a-year agency charged with regulating the energy 
industry, and it would be unconscionable if any of the nation's electricity 
traders or generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs 
or becomes a member of the commission," Feinstein wrote. 
"Since FERC has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the 
Federal Power Act to restore 'just and reasonable' electricity rates, we need 
to ask whether undue influence by the companies that FERC regulates has 
resulted in its failure to act," the letter said. 
Feinstein seeks a broad investigation into FERC, and not just an airing of 
the Lay-Hebert exchange, which Feinstein said she sees as an example of "a 
definite problem," the senator's spokesman, Howard Gantman, said. 
"There are very close relationships between FERC and the industry it 
regulates. Some of those relationships could be improper," Gantman said. 
Lieberman, who has requested that the General Accounting Office investigate 
FERC's response to the California electricity crisis, will become chairman of 
the Governmental Affairs Committee when Democrats assume the Senate majority 
in about two weeks. 
There was no immediate response from Lieberman's office regarding Feinstein's 
letter.

U.S. Physical Gas Cash Prices Fall; No Load Weekend

HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- U.S. natural gas physical prices fell Friday ahead of a 
no-load holiday weekend, widening considerably the differential to the New 
York Mercantile Exchange futures board. 
Traders saw storage buying providing the only hint of demand.
Also, several pipelines in Texas, along with El Paso's Tennessee Gas and PG&E 
Citygate, held system-wide operational flow orders on the high inventory 
resulting from storage. Those orders also sent prices downward, traders said. 
Demand remains slight with only hints of sustained hot weather sighted in the 
next two weeks,traders said. 
With few demand fundamentals in place, traders saw few utilities in the 
market. 
The Nymex June futures contract settled at $3.973/MMBtu, down 8.1 cents, the 
first time the front contract has fallen below $4/MMBtu in nearly 10 months. 
Traders pointed to 17,000 option puts at $4/MMBtu supporting the June 
contract. Options expired Friday; the June contract expires Tuesday after the 
Memorial Day weekend. Traders expect a $3.80-$4/MMBtu range on Tuesday for 
expiration. 
Also, Enron Online will keep its trading boards open for the holiday. 
Prices for the June contract are in the same range as they were a year ago, 
when driving heat and competition for gas during May pushed prices upward. 
At the benchmark Henry Hub in south Louisiana, prices were in a 
$3.76-$3.90/MMBtu range, down 25 cents-35 cents. 
Deals at Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Station No. 65 were done at 
$3.82-$3.94/MMBtu, down 25 cents-32 cents. 
At the Arizona-California border, El Paso's prices fell $1.40-$2.55/MMBtu to 
a $9.80-$11.50 closing range. Western electricity prices weakened again 
Friday for the holiday, and traders said pipelines into California were 
showing high inventories. 
At the PG&E Citygate, prices fell $4.25-$5.50 to a $3.90-$4.40/MMBtu closing 
range on the reported operational flow order. 
Buyers paid $3.74-$3.90/MMBtu at the Katy hub in East Texas, down 23 cents-32 
cents. At Waha in West Texas, buyers paid $3.59-$3.75, down 30 cents-39 
cents.

FOCUS Brazil real to remain pressured due to energy crisis/political concerns

05/25/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

SAO PAULO (AFX) - The real is likely to remain under pressure in the 
short-to-medium term due to concerns about the impact of the energy shortage 
crisis on the economy and ongoing political worries, analysts said. 
They said the energy shortage problems are scaring away direct foreign 
investment, while political concerns ahead of the presidential elections next 
year are expected to come much more to the forefront once the Argentine debt 
swap operation is completed at the start of next month.
The real was at 2.3480 against the dollar in afternoon trade, down about 20 
pct from the end of last year. 
Analysts said the weakness of the real combined with a generally-accepted 
slowdown in GDP growth as a result of the energy crisis has complicated the 
task of the central bank's monetary policy committee Copom. 
The Copom raised its base interbank Selic rate to 16.75 pct from 16.25 pct 
earlier this week, in what was regarded by many analysts as a preventive move 
against the inflationary impact of the real's depreciation. 
In a recent report, Banco Santander Central Hispano SA said it has revised 
its forecast for Brazil's 2001 GDP growth to 2.2 pct from 4.1 pct previously 
due to the possible impact of the government's energy rationing plan. 
BSCH said it is also cutting its 2002 GDP growth estimate to 3.0 pct from 4.5 
pct previously. 
BSCH also revised its forecast for the real's level against the dollar to 
2.30 by end-2001 from 2.13. 
"Argentina's problems and their effects on the flow of capital to Brazil... 
added to energy rationing and stronger perceptions of political risk hinder a 
significant appreciation of the real, although we consider a possible gradual 
solution to the Argentine crisis," BSCH said. 
Analysts said central bank intervention yesterday and today in the foreign 
currency market in an effort to stem the real's depreciation is clear 
evidence of the central bank's concerns about the local unit. 
The central bank today sold 2.0 mln dollar linked-bonds maturing on March 14, 
2002 after selling 1.0 mln dollar-linked bonds yesterday. 
"We don't know how far the real will go. Everything points to a situation in 
which the dollar will move to the 2.45 level against the real in the short 
term and never return to the 2.0 level it was at at the start of the year," 
Brazilian Institute of the Economy (IBRE) director Renier Garcma said. 
Direct foreign investment has slowed down this year as a result of the 
concerns surrounding Brazil. 
The government has already revised its estimate of direct foreign investment 
in Brazil this year to 19 bln usd from 24 bln previously. Direct foreign 
investment in the four months to April was 6.6 bln usd, about half the levels 
posted a year earlier. 
Enron Corp recently suspend investments of 600 mln usd in the Brazilian 
energy sector, citing regulatory concerns, while the government decided to 
postpone indefinitely the privatisation of Cia Energetica earlier this month 
due to the energy crisis. 
The minimum price for the sale of Cesp Parana was set at 1.7 bln reals, with 
a number of foreign companies lined up to bid. 
"Investors are shying away from carrying out operations in the country. The 
energy crisis has had a disastrous impact on Brazil's image; the country risk 
has risen and companies are opting for saver markets," IBRE's Garcma said. 
Analysts said the energy crisis has strongly affected the image of President 
Fernando Henrique Cardoso and has therefore strengthened the opposition's 
position ahead of next year's presidential elections. 
They said corruption allegations involving former and current senior 
officials in the government and the alleged breach of vote secrecy rules at 
the Senate resulting in proceedings for the dismissal of former Senate 
chairman Antonio Carlos Magalhaes and senator Jose Roberto Arruda have 
complicated the political scenario. 
Yesterday, Senator Arruda resigned from the Senate, while a local TV news 
channel reported Magalhaes will resign next week and attack Cardoso. 
"The government seems to have lost direction," one analyst said. 
Earlier this month, Congress rejected a petition presented by the left-wing 
Workers Party (PT) to set up a joint Congress-Senate commission to 
investigate corruption in the private and public sectors after 20 
parliamentarians belonging to parties within the ruling coalition withdrew 
their support for the motion. 
Opposition deputy Aloizio Mercadante at the time said the PT was preparing 
legal action against the government and the deputies who withdrew their 
support for the petition, alleging they were offered financial incentives to 
do so. 
Analysts said fears remain that the opposition will attempt to revive the 
corruption commission issue, further complicating the governability of the 
country in an already delicate moment.

Vice Pres Cheney Sees Wood As New FERC Chairman - NYT

05/25/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Vice President Richard Cheney expects Texas Public 
Utilities Commission Chairman Pat Wood to become chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission, according to Friday's New York Times. 
In an interview for an upcoming episode of the PBS series Frontline, Cheney 
says, "Pat Wood's got to be the new chairman of the FERC, and he'll have to 
address" various problems in electricity markets, according to the Times 
article, part of a joint effort with the Frontline program.
The article says current Republican FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert received a 
call from Enron Corp. (ENE) Chairman Kenneth Lay this year prodding him to 
back a national push for retail electricity competition and faster access to 
the power transmission grid in exchange for Enron's support of Hebert in his 
new job. 
It quotes Hebert as saying, "I was offended." 
Lay, one of President George W. Bush's largest campaign contributors, 
provided the White House with a list of preferred candidates for FERC posts 
and had access to the White House energy policy task force chaired by Cheney, 
the article says. 
Wednesday the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved Wood and 
Nora Brownwell of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission, Bush's 
nominees to fill two empty seats on FERC's five-member board. The full Senate 
has yet to approve them. 
It would be up to the president whether to replace Hebert as chairman. In the 
Times article, Hebert said no one has told him he would be replaced.

INDIA: Enron's woes make Indian power firms anxious.
By Himangshu Watts

05/25/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW DELHI, May 25 (Reuters) - India's private power producers demanded on 
Friday that the federal government intervene in Enron Corp's bitter row with 
a local utility and state clearly if it wants the U.S. energy giant to stay 
in India or quit. 
"The government needs to decide whether we want Enron or not. In case they 
don't want Enron, they should spell out the reasons for it," Harry Dhaul, 
director-general of the Independent Power Producers' Association of India, 
told Reuters.
But Federal Power Secretary A.K. Basu said Enron and the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board (MSEB) had to resolve their differences over the $2.9 
billion project themselves. 
"Basically the Maharashtra government and Dabhol have to sort it out," Basu 
told reporters after a meeting with Wade Cline, the chief executive officer 
of Enron India. 
Basu stuck to the federal government's stand that it would help implement any 
proposal emerging from negotiations between the Dabhol Power Co, 65-percent 
owned by Enron, and the MSEB. 
Dhaul said the fate of Dabhol, India's largest direct foreign investment and 
biggest power project, would determine the future of domestic and foreign 
private investment in power and other infrastructure projects. 
"It is an important issue. It is a benchmark for all future infrastructure 
investments of $1 billion plus." 
On Thursday, Enron said the MSEB cancelled a disputed power-buying contract 
just five days after the Houston-based energy firm moved to pull out of the 
project. 
WANT PRO-ACTIVE APPROACH 
Dhaul said the federal government should intervene in the dispute between 
Enron and the utility. "We want a pro-active approach in supporting 
independent power producers." 
Basu said the government had advised Enron to thrash out the matter with the 
negotiation committee set up by the Maharashtra government. The committee is 
due to meet on May 29. 
Cline refused to answer questions from reporters and only said the company 
would not renegotiate the power-buying contract on the basis of a committee 
set up by the state government. 
"We won't renegotiate on the basis of the Godbole Committee report," he said. 
The committee, chaired by a former bureaucrat Madhavrao Godbole, has 
suggested that the tariff be re-negotiated to make it cheaper and to remove 
the dollar linkage which resulted in a steep increase each time the rupee 
fell against the dollar. 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to it charging 7.1 rupees per kilowatt hour versus 1.5 rupees 
charged by other suppliers. 
Dabhol Power Co is building India's largest power plant with a total capacity 
of 2,184 MW. 
The first phase of the $2.9-billion project with a capacity of 740 MW began 
operating in May 1999. The second phase that will add 1,444 MW of capacity, 
is expected to be completed this year.

Enron Unit's Sales, Costs Rise With Power Prices, Paper Says
2001-05-25 13:00 (New York)


     Portland, Oregon, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s
Portland General Electric reported first-quarter earnings rose
10 percent as high electricity prices pushed up both sales and
costs for the Oregon power producer, the Oregonian reported.
     The company earned $43 million, the paper said. Revenue from
wholesale power sales was $480 million, three times the year-
earlier period, even as costs to buy electricity almost doubled.
     PGE's power plants produce less than half the electricity
needed to supply its 728,000 Oregon customers, forcing the company
to buy power on the same markets into which it sells, the paper
said. Dry weather is cutting hydropower resources, and easing
wholesale prices could make it more difficult for the company to
profit from power sales outside the state, the paper said.
     Edison International's Southern California Edison, which has
filed for bankruptcy, and two California agencies, one of which is
now defunct, owe the company $128 million, the paper said. The
company is pursuing collection, the paper said, citing Chief
Financial Officer James Piro.



India Enron Panel Lacks Authority to Solve Dispute, Expert Says

India Enron Panel Lacks Authority to Solve Dispute, Expert Says

     Mumbai, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Indian negotiators lack the
authority to solve a dispute that has shut down Enron Corp.'s $3
billion power plant, India's single biggest foreign investment,
said a former member of the negotiating committee.
     The negotiators will meet Enron officials on Tuesday next
week, though any proposals made will not be binding on either
Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board, the official said. Maharashtra, Dabhol's
sole customer, has refused to pay some of its power bills.
     ``Where is the guarantee Enron and the government will accept
what the committee recommends,'' said R.K. Pachauri, director-
general at the Tata Energy Research Institute, a research
organization. Pachauri said he quit the committee because it was
being asked to renegotiate the project, when it was set up to
solve the payment dispute.
     Maharashtra yesterday served Dabhol notice canceling the
power purchase contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board
notice it was set to pull out of the project in six months.
     The board has refused to pay Dabhol 3 billion rupees for
power supplied in December and January, saying the bills should
reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty it imposed on the company Jan.
28 for failing to supply power at full capacity.

                            Meeting

     Other India officials said the two parties can't afford not
to negotiate as there is too much at stake.
     Mahrashtra and Dabhol serving each other notices is ``simply
legal maneuvering,'' said Kirit Parikh, an economist on the prime
minister's economic advisory council.
     ``It won't affect the process of finding a solution because
``the ground reality is neither Enron nor Maharashtra can afford
not to find a compromise'' to the dispute, Parikh said.
     The government needs a solution as it could be left footing
the bill.
     India's federal and state governments, which have guaranteed
the board's payments for power and some of the loans to help fund
the project, may have to pay Dabhol more than 170 billion rupees
($3.6 billion) if it terminates the 2,184 megawatt power project.
     ``We are going back to Maharashtra tomorrow to work on the
problem.'' Dabhol managing director Wade Cline said. Cline was in
New Delhi to meet A. K. Basu, secretary to the ministry of power.

National Desk; Section A
Power Trader Tied to Bush Finds Washington All Ears
By LOWELL BERGMAN and JEFF GERTH

05/25/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

Curtis Hebert Jr., Washington's top electricity regulator, said he had barely 
settled into his new job this year when he had an unsettling telephone 
conversation with Kenneth L. Lay, the head of the nation's largest 
electricity trader, the Enron Corporation. 
Mr. Hebert, chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said that 
Mr. Lay, a close friend of President Bush's, offered him a deal: If he 
changed his views on electricity deregulation, Enron would continue to 
support him in his new job.
Mr. Hebert (pronounced A-bear) recalled that Mr. Lay prodded him to back a 
national push for retail competition in the energy business and a faster pace 
in opening up access to the electricity transmission grid to companies like 
Enron. 
Mr. Hebert said he refused the offer. ''I was offended,'' he recalled, though 
he said he knew of Mr. Lay's influence in Washington and thought the refusal 
could put his job in jeopardy. 
Asked about the conversation, Mr. Lay praised Mr. Hebert, but recalled it 
differently. ''I remember him requesting'' Enron's support at the White 
House, he said of Mr. Hebert. Mr. Lay said he had ''very possibly'' discussed 
issues relating to the commission's authority over access to the grid. 
As to Mr. Hebert's job, Mr. Lay said he told the chairman that ''the final 
decision on this was going to be the president's, certainly not ours.'' 
Though the accounts of the discussion differ, that it took place at all 
illustrates Enron's considerable influence in Washington, especially at the 
commission, the agency authorized to ensure fair prices in the nation's 
wholesale electricity and natural gas markets, Enron's main business. 
Mr. Lay has been one of Mr. Bush's largest campaign contributors, and no 
other energy company gave more money to Republican causes last year than 
Enron. 
And it appears that Mr. Hebert may soon be replaced as the commission's 
chairman, according to Vice President Dick Cheney, the Bush administration's 
point man on energy policy. 
Mr. Lay has weighed in on candidates for other commission posts, supplying 
President Bush's chief personnel adviser with a list of preferred candidates. 
One Florida utility regulator who hoped for but did not receive an 
appointment as a commissioner said he had been ''interviewed'' by Mr. Lay. 
Mr. Lay also had access to the team writing the White House's energy report, 
which embraces several initiatives and issues dear to Enron. 
The report's recommendations include finding ways to give the federal 
government more power over electricity transmission networks, a longtime goal 
of the company that was spelled out in a memorandum Mr. Lay discussed during 
a 30-minute meeting earlier this spring with Mr. Cheney. 
Mr. Cheney's report includes much of what Mr. Lay advocated during their 
meeting, documents show. Both men deny discussing commission personnel issues 
during their talk. But Mr. Lay had an unusual opportunity to make his case 
about candidates in writing and in person to Mr. Bush's personnel adviser, 
Clay Johnson. And when Mr. Bush picked nominees to fill two vacant Republican 
slots on the five-member commission, they both had the backing of Enron, as 
well as other companies. 
Mr. Lay is not shy about voicing his opinion or flexing his political muscle. 
He has transformed the Houston-based Enron from a sleepy natural-gas company 
into a $100 billion energy giant with global reach, trading electricity in 
all corners of the world and owning a multibillion-dollar power project in 
India. He has also led the push to deregulate the nation's electricity 
markets. 
Senior Bush administration officials said they welcomed Mr. Lay's input but 
did not always embrace it: President Bush backed away from curbing 
carbon-dioxide emissions, an effort supported by Enron, which had looked to 
trade emission rights as part of its energy business. 
''We'll make decisions based on what we think makes sound public policy,'' 
Mr. Cheney said in an interview, not what ''Enron thinks.'' 
The Bush-Lay bond traces back to Mr. Bush's father and involves a personal 
and philosophical affinity. Moreover, Enron and its executives gave $2.4 
million to federal candidates in the last election, more than any other 
energy company. While some of that went to Democrats, 72 percent went to 
Republicans, according to an analysis of election records by the Center for 
Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group. 
''He's for a lot of things we're for,'' said Mr. Johnson. 
But when it came to deciding on nominees for the commission, Mr. Johnson said 
that Mr. Lay's views were not that crucial. The two most important advisers, 
he said, were Andrew Lundquist, the director of Mr. Cheney's energy task 
force, and Pat Wood 3rd, the head of the Texas public utility commission. 
As governor, Mr. Bush named Mr. Wood to the utility commission. This year, 
when the White House filled the two Republican slots on the federal agency, 
Mr. Wood was the first choice, Mr. Johnson said. 
Consumer advocates and business executives praise Mr. Wood. But Mr. Lay also 
had a role in promoting him. Shortly after Mr. Bush was elected governor in 
1994, Mr. Lay sent him a letter endorsing Mr. Wood as the ''best qualified'' 
person for the Texas commission. 
In all, there are five seats on the commission, two held by Republicans, two 
by Democrats and one held by a chairman who serves at the pleasure of the 
president. Mr. Hebert, who became a commissioner in 1997, was named chairman 
by Mr. Bush in January. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's mandate to ensure fair prices in 
wholesale electricity and natural gas markets makes it crucial to sellers 
like Enron as well as consumers. 
The movement toward deregulation sometimes leaves the commission caught in a 
tug of war: power marketers like Enron are trying to break into markets and 
grids controlled by old-line utilities, which operate under state regulation. 
The commission's chairman has considerable latitude in setting its agenda. 
As part of its oversight of the wholesale electricity markets, the commission 
ordered several companies to refund what it considered excessively high 
prices this year in California. One lesser offender named in the commission's 
public filings -- $3.2 million, of a total of $125 million -- was an Enron 
subsidiary in Oregon. 
Enron owns few generating assets, but buys and sells electricity in the 
market. Many of those transactions resemble the complicated risk-shifting 
techniques used by Wall Street for financial instruments. 
Mr. Hebert, after he became chairman, initiated an examination into the 
effects those techniques have on the electricity markets. ''One of our 
problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel the complex 
arbitrage activities of a company like Enron,'' he said, adding, ''we're 
trying to do it now, and we may have some results soon.'' 
William L. Massey, one of the agency's two Democratic commissioners, said he 
supported the inquiry but had not been aware of it -- an indication of the 
chairman's ability to set the commission's agenda. 
Finally, the commission is trying to speed the pace of electricity 
deregulation by opening up the nation's transmission grid, much of which is 
owned by privately owned utilities that enjoy retail monopolies. Some Enron 
officials say the commission has been moving too slowly to open the grid. 
They attribute some of the problem to utilities. But they also fault Mr. 
Hebert. 
''Hebert still has undeserved confidence in some of the vertically integrated 
companies coming to the table and dealing openly'' with transmission access 
issues, said Richard S. Shapiro, an Enron senior vice president. 
The utilities, however, maintain that they provide cheap and reliable service 
for their customers. Washington lobbyists for one Southern utility said that 
Enron was really interested in focusing on the utility's big-business 
clients, which under state regulation pay higher rates than residential 
customers. 
Since 1996, about half the states have moved to open their retail markets to 
competition, and the commission has begun to make it easier for outsiders to 
use the nation's transmission grid. But the promise of cheaper rates has been 
largely unfulfilled. So the push for more deregulation, in which Enron has 
been a leader, has slowed, especially when California's flawed program led to 
skyrocketing rates and chaotic markets. 
Mr. Hebert is a free-market conservative who favors deregulation but also 
recognizes the importance of state's rights. A former Mississippi regulator, 
he is a protege of Trent Lott, the Senate Republican leader from Mississippi. 
Mr. Hebert said Mr. Lott was instrumental in his nomination to the commission 
in 1997 by President Clinton. 
President Bush elevated Mr. Hebert to chairman on Inauguration Day, a move 
Mr. Lay said he told the White House he supported. 
Mr. Johnson, the White House personnel chief, said that Mr. Lott and Mr. 
Hebert had both been told that Mr. Hebert could remain chairman at least 
until the administration's nominees -- Mr. Wood and Nora Brownell, a 
Pennsylvania utility regulator -- are confirmed by the full Senate. The 
Senate energy committee voted earlier this week to approve the two nominees, 
after a hearing last week indicated strong support. 
It is widely expected that President Bush will name Mr. Wood to replace Mr. 
Hebert as chairman after the Senate acts. 
In an interview for a forthcoming episode of ''Frontline,'' the PBS series, 
Mr. Cheney suggested as much. ''Pat Wood's got to be the new chairman of the 
F.E.R.C., and he'll have to address'' various problems in the electricity 
markets, he said. 
Mr. Hebert said that no one had told him he was being replaced. If someone 
else is named chairman, Mr. Hebert can remain a commissioner until the end of 
his term, which expires in 2004. 
It was a few weeks after President Bush made him chairman that Mr. Hebert 
said he spoke by telephone with Mr. Lay. 
Mr. Lay told him that ''he and Enron would like to support me as chairman, 
but we would have to agree on principles'' involving the commission's role in 
expanding electricity competition, Mr. Hebert said of the conversation. 
A senior commission official who was in Mr. Hebert's office during the 
conversation said Mr. Hebert rebuffed Mr. Lay's offer of a quid pro quo. The 
official said that he heard Mr. Hebert's side of the conversation and then, 
after the call ended, learned the rest from him. 
Mr. Hebert said that he, too, backed competition but did not think the 
commission had the legal authority to tell states what to do in this area. 
Concerning the issue of opening transmission access through the creation of 
regional networks, Mr. Hebert supports a voluntary process while Enron seeks 
a faster and more compulsory system. 
Mr. Lay said that while he might have discussed issues relating to the 
commission's authority concerning access to the grid, ''there was never any 
intent'' to link that or any other issue to Mr. Hebert's job status. 
The commission is a quasijudicial agency, so decision-makers like Mr. Hebert 
must avoid private discussions about specific matters pending before the 
commission. Mr. Hebert and Mr. Lay both said that line was not crossed, but 
Mr. Hebert said he had never had such a blunt talk with an energy-industry 
executive. 
Mr. Lay added that his few recent conversations with Mr. Hebert were nothing 
special. ''We had a lot of access during the Clinton administration,'' he 
said. 
And he said that while making political contributions ''probably helps'' to 
gain access to an official, he made them ''because I'm supporting candidates 
I strongly believe in.'' 
Last June, Enron executives were asked to make voluntary donations to the 
company's political action committee. The solicitation letter noted that the 
company faced a range of governmental issues, including electricity 
deregulation. 
This year, some people who sought but did not get nominations to the 
commission said that Mr. Lay and Enron had had a role in the process. 
One was Joe Garcia, a former Florida utilities regulator and prominent 
Cuban-American activist. He said he had been ''interviewed'' by a few Enron 
officials, including Mr. Lay, who he said had not been as ''forceful or 
insistent'' as the other Enron officials. 
But in their conversation, Mr. Garcia said, Mr. Lay made clear that he would 
be visiting the White House, adding that ''everyone knew of his relationship 
and his importance.'' 
Mr. Johnson, the White House personnel chief, could not cite another company 
besides Enron that sent him a list of preferred candidates for the 
commission, but he remembered hearing the views of Tom Kuhn, who heads the 
utility industry trade group, the Edison Electric Institute. Mr. Kuhn was a 
classmate of Mr. Johnson and Mr. Bush at Yale. 
As for his conversation with Mr. Garcia, Mr. Lay said he was comfortable with 
his candidacy but ''I'm not sure what I told him about my friends at the 
White House.'' 
This article is part of a joint reporting project with the PBS series 
''Frontline,'' which will broadcast a documentary about California's energy 
crisis on June 5.

Enron Unit's Cline on Dispute With Indian Province: Comment
2001-05-25 03:53 (New York)


     New Delhi, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Wade Cline, managing
director of Enron Corp.'s Dabhol Power Co., on the dispute with
the western Indian province of Maharashtra over dues. He was
speaking to reporters in New Delhi after meeting A.K. Basu,
secretary to the ministry of power.

     ``We won't renegotiate on the basis of the Godbole committee
report. We are going back to Maharashtra tomorrow to work on the
problem.''

     Dabhol Power said yesterday the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board, its sole customer, served notice that it's canceling their
seven-year-old power purchase contract.
     The notice came six days after Dabhol gave the board a
``preliminary termination notice'' because of an unresolved six-
month dispute over bills owed by the board.
     Madhav Godbole, also the Indian government's chief negotiator
in the current dispute, headed a committee set up by the
Maharashtra provincial government to suggest ways to lower the
cost of power supplied by Dabhol.




U.S. Energy Regulator May Be Replaced, New York Times Reports
2001-05-25 06:04 (New York)


     Washington, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. gave more money
to Republican causes last year than any other energy company and
the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, whose
policies the company object to, may soon be replaced, the New York
Times reported.
     Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay objected to Curtis Hebert Jr's
views on electricity deregulation, telling him he would continue
to support the regulator if he changed perspective, the Times
reported. Hebert may soon be ousted, the Times reported Vice
President Dick Cheney as saying.
     Lay drew up a shortlist of candidates he would like to see
named as Hebert's replacement, the Times said. One Florida utility
regulator who hoped to win the job was interviewed by Lay, it
added.
     ``We'll make decisions based on what we think makes sound
public policy,'' Cheney told the Times. The decision won't be
based on what ``Enron thinks.''

Energy Antics: Oh, Behave!

Admit it: The only comic relief in this energy crisis has been watching our 
leaders go at suppliers and each other like pro wrestlers or Jerry Springer 
guests. 
In his State of the State address last January, Gov. Gray Davis accused the 
big private electric power generators of legalized highway robbery and 
threatened to seize their plants if necessary. Then he really got angry, 
calling them "the biggest snakes in the world." This past week, Atty. Gen. 
Bill Lockyer boosted the rhetoric a notch by declaring he would like to 
personally escort the chairman of Enron Corp. "to an 8-by-10 cell that he 
could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey."' 
Meanwhile, President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney have blamed 
California for causing its own problems with a "harebrained" deregulation 
scheme and mocked the state's power purchases and conservation programs. It's 
been fun. Now it's time for our leaders to act like adults.
Davis and Bush always will have their political differences, but the 
economies of both the state and the nation are endangered by California's 
energy situation. These leaders need to work together as cooperatively as 
possible, starting next week when Bush makes his first visit to California as 
president. 
Davis wrote Bush Wednesday offering to meet with him during his California 
visit. Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the president looks forward to 
discussing energy and other issues. Good start. Let's hope the conversation 
is civil and that the civility spreads. 
No matter how much California has been abused by the power companies, and it 
absolutely has, the state still needs them to help solve the crisis caused by 
shortages of electric power generation this year and next. Usually, the 
biggest targets of official and public wrath are the investor-owned utilities 
such as Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. But not 
this time because, in the view of the state, the utilities have been bled dry 
by the power generators' stratospheric prices. The state had to take over the 
purchase of power when the generators refused to extend any more credit to 
Edison and PG&E. Legal recourse should be pursued, but the threatening 
rhetoric needs to subside. 
State lawmakers are right to be upset with the White House for refusing to 
use its authority to set reasonable temporary wholesale price controls. And 
Davis is justifiably upset with Bush and with Cheney, who said the only 
solution was to build more power plants--ignoring the fact that the state is 
building 10 plants now, with five more on the way, and that the only way to 
control wholesale power rates is for Washington to cap them. 
If the state hadn't bought the power, the generators would have let the 
lights go out. Davis needs to deliver that message, quietly and persuasively, 
while Bush is in California. And Bush needs to listen respectfully, like an 
adult.

Lockyer comes out swinging at oilman / Davis has plenty of company in depths 
of poll

The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.21
(Copyright 2001)

The reaction from Gov. Gray Davis' camp to yesterday's poll showing him in 
the dumper was quick and blunt. 
"Tell me something I don't already know," adviser Paul Maslin said after 
being hit with the news that the latest Field Poll showed Davis' job rating 
down 18 points since January.
"None of this is news to us," Maslin said. 
Heck, these days even nuclear power is more popular than Davis. 
But to Maslin, who has been watching his client's popularity drop with every 
rolling blackout, the question isn't how Davis is doing today. It's how he 
looks in a year and a half when he faces re- election that counts. 
And on that score, Davis & Co. seem to be oddly relieved at all the bad poll 
numbers that have come out this week. 
Because while their guy is definitely in trouble, everyone else is even 
deeper in trouble -- especially George W. Bush. 
The only announced Republicans running for governor -- Secretary of State 
Bill Jones and businessman William Simon Jr. -- aren't even the first picks 
of GOP voters. 
That honor goes to outgoing Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan -- who actually 
does very well when matched up against Davis. In fact, if he ran, the polls 
show it would be a dead heat. 
At this point, however, the only person who seems to think the 72- year-old 
Riordan is going to run is his good San Francisco buddy and adviser Clint 
Reilly, who has been spending a lot of time in Los Angeles of late. 
As for a challenge to Davis from within Democratic ranks? 
Well, the most frequently mentioned possibles -- Attorney General Bill 
Lockyer and Treasurer Phil Angelides -- both trail Davis in job performance 
ratings. 
There was one interesting twist that wasn't in the Field Poll. 
>From what we hear, an energy company recently did a survey of its own that 
included a matchup between Davis and Sen. Dianne Feinstein, of all people. 
The result: DiFi cleans Gray's clock. 
RAIDER REVENGE: The Oakland Raiders may be eating more than crow after losing 
their big lawsuit against the National Football League. 
They may also have to eat upwards of $10 million in lawyers fees - - and not 
just for their own lawyers. 
It turns out that under NFL rules, they may also get socked with the bills 
for hundreds of hours of depositions, expert witnesses and the NFL's team of 
eight to 10 lawyers who charged an average of $350 to $400 an hour. 
Not to mention all those weeks the legal team was holed up at Los Angeles' 
tony Omni Hotel on Bunker Hill fighting the Raiders' claim to the Los Angeles 
market. 
And just to add further insult, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue says league 
owners haven't ruled out fining and suspending Raiders' boss Al Davis for 
bringing his lawsuit against the NFL in the first place. 
The Raiders are still considering whether to appeal this week's jury verdict 
-- a roll of the dice that would further drive up the legal tab if the team 
comes up craps. 
As for the odds that Tagliabue might give Davis a pass on paying the league's 
trial costs? 
"Not a prayer," says one lawyer on the case. 
On the other hand, Big Al could always sue them back. 
FUNNY NUMBERS: The question of whether there are 3,600 "unaccounted for" 
votes from November's election isn't the only funny thing going on down at 
the San Francisco Department of Elections. 
There's the department's spend-happy ways as well. 
"Unbelievable," was how Budget Analyst Harvey Rose summed up the department's 
recent request: $1.4 million so it can move from its digs in the basement of 
City Hall to a $678,000-a-year office space on Market Street. 
All in the name of "efficiency," of course. 
THE WILD ZONE: The World Wildlife Fund held its first-ever West Coast 
fund-raiser last weekend at the new Presidio park. 
The $1,000-a-head fund-raiser, which featured the band B-52's, drew upwards 
of 1,200 partygoers to a pair of lavishly decorated hangars -- and included 
honorary chairwoman Lauren Hutton, comic Drew Carey and a bevy of local and 
New York socialites. 
Presiding over it all was World Wildlife Fund chairman Bill Reilly, who also 
happens to be a member of the Presidio Trust board that oversees the park. 
We're happy to report that unlike University High's Decorator Showcase -- 
which has its own board connections and is getting free rent at the Presidio 
-- the World Wildlife Fund ponied up $10,600 in rent. 
Not a bad investment, considering that the party brought in close to 
$700,000, according to event organizers. 
QUOTE OF THE WEEK: State Attorney General Bill Lockyer has never been known 
as a loose cannon, so when he told the Wall Street Journal this week that he 
would love to personally escort Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay into "an 
8-by-10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name 
is Spike, honey,' " more than a few eyes popped wide. 
So what's up? 
"I want these generators in Texas and elsewhere to know that we are coming 
after them," Lockyer tells us. "And we're not talking about a 10-year fight 
to get our money back -- if we have the facts right, we're going to put them 
in prison." 
Besides, Lockyer says, his "missile" wasn't really meant for "home 
consumption" -- rather, it was aimed at the Big Money crowd back East.

Latest move in dispute threatens Enron project 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
Copyright 2001 Houston Chronicle 
Indian officials have upped the ante in the standoff with Enron Corp. over 
unpaid power bills at the Houston company's Dabhol Power project. The latest 
wrinkle in the longstanding dispute raises questions about the future of the 
beleaguered $3 billion project. 
Enron received notice Thursday from its sole customer, the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Board, that it was canceling a 7-year-old power purchase 
agreement. 
The board has refused to pay for power from the plant, saying the bills 
should be lower because Enron is not living up to its contract. Indian 
officials say Enron is not supplying power at full capacity within three 
hours of being restarted after a shutdown, as required by the deal. 
Enron responded with a statement describing the move as a "deliberate attempt 
to further delay the resolution of difficult issues" confronting the board. 
Termination of the project at this late stage could trigger an estimated $2 
billion in future obligations by India's state and federal governments. 
This latest round in the battle capped off a week of turmoil between the 
Houston company and Indian political officials over the project. 
Last weekend, Enron started proceedings to end the contract by serving the 
board a "preliminary termination notice" because of large unpaid power bills. 
Enron is owed about $64 million for power sold in December and January. 
Then Wednesday, a negotiator trying to resolve the payment dispute between 
the company and the electricity board resigned and then retracted his 
resignation the same day. 
The standoff between Enron and the electricity board and Indian politicians 
is expected to continue into next week, when formal negotiations are 
scheduled to begin. 
Enron is maintaining that the board does not have the right to cancel the 
agreement on the grounds it has stated. 
There has been speculation that Enron is looking to sell its 65 percent share 
of the project, and this latest round of fighting has revived that talk. The 
company has answered such questions in the past by saying it is committed to 
the project. 
"Even if this is resolved, Enron still wants to free itself altogether from 
this investment," said Carol Coale, energy analyst with Prudential Securities 
in Houston. "What investors are afraid of is a write-off. Enron has $850 
million in equity in the project; the rest is debt." 
Currently, the first phase of the project is running at about 37 percent 
capacity and providing Enron with a 5 percent return on its investment, Coale 
said. That ranks it among the company's poorest-performing investments. 
Finding a buyer that would pay fair value for the plant with all of its 
political baggage could be difficult. Potential buyers are believed to be 
Reliance, one of India's largest industrial concerns, or China Light & Power. 
India's federal and state governments have guaranteed the payment for power 
from the plant as well as loans for the project, the largest single foreign 
investment in India. 
An Enron spokesman in India described the board's latest move as a "long 
shot." 
"We have said for some time that there was going to be a lot of noise 
associated with this and legal maneuvering," Enron spokesman John Ambler 
said. "The odds of this being successful are very small." 
Enron is committed to working out a resolution to the dispute, Ambler said, 
and is helping to find credit-worthy electric customers that might be able to 
step in and buy power that the state of Maharashtra does not need. 
Enron has faced ongoing problems in India, almost from the time of its 
initial investment in the project in the early 1990s. 
In 1995 the state government, then headed by the Hindu ultranationalist party 
Shiv Sena, scrapped the project, saying the price of its power was too high. 
The project was idled in the midst of the construction of the first phase, 
costing Enron an estimated $100,000 a day while work was halted. The project 
was eventually restarted after voters chose another slate of politicians in 
the region. 
The project's first phase of 740 megawatts is on line. The second phase of 
1,444 megawatts is scheduled to go into operation later this year, but Ambler 
would not confirm when it will actually start operating, if at all. 






International
Indian State Moves To End Power Pact With Enron's Dabhol

NEW DELHI -- The sole customer of Enron Corp.'s troubled power project in 
India said it is rescinding its contract to buy electricity from the company, 
escalating the bitter fight between the two sides over unpaid bills. 
The project, Dabhol Power Corp., said it received a letter from the 
Maharashtra State Electricity Board announcing the move. But Dabhol said in a 
statement that the board "does not have the right to rescind the 
[power-purchase agreement] as attempted in their letter." The chairman of the 
state electricity board wasn't available to comment.
The $3 billion Dabhol project, India's largest foreign investment, is under 
attack by critics who say its rates are too high. Dabhol disputes that claim. 
The electricity board's action puts Dabhol in the position of defending a 
contract that it, too, has recently indicated a willingness to abandon. About 
a week ago, Dabhol gave notice it was formally initiating a procedure to 
cancel the contract in six months if the dispute isn't resolved. Dabhol says 
it is owed $48 million in unpaid bills by the electricity board. The 
electricity board, in turn, claims the bills are offset by millions of 
dollars in fines that Dabhol owes due to service lapses. 
Dabhol holds guarantees from India's central government to cover bill 
defaults, and the government has said it wants to help find a resolution to 
the standoff. A meeting with government officials is set for Tuesday, and 
Dabhol has said it is interested in hearing about prospects for selling power 
to other customers.

Markets / Your Money Dow, Nasdaq Make Modest Gains Wall St.: Politics and 
economic concerns weigh down some stocks prior to slated talk by Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan.

Stocks ended an uneven session with moderate gains Thursday as investors 
vacillated between optimism and fear about the economy. The market also was 
trying to determine the effect of the change in leadership in the Senate. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 16.91 points, or 0.2%, at 
11,122.42 after falling 60 points earlier in the session.
Wall Street's broader indicators followed the Dow's path, advancing late in 
the session. The Nasdaq composite index rose 38.54 points, or 1.7%, to 
2,282.02, while the Standard & Poor's 500 index moved up 4.12 points, or 
0.3%, to 1,293.17. 
Thursday's trading was choppy from the start when Vermont Sen. James M. 
Jeffords announced, as expected, that he is leaving the Republican Party to 
become an independent, ending GOP control of the Senate. 
"Everyone is sort of going through their own analysis of what effect the 
change in the legislature is going to have for various sectors in the 
market," said Charles White, portfolio manager for Avatar Associates. 
But analysts said the market's fluctuation mostly came amid unease over the 
health of the economy. Investors were trading cautiously ahead of a speech 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was scheduled to deliver Thursday 
night before the Economic Club of New York. 
"The next quarter or two are going to be weak," White said. "We already know 
that. What we want to hear from the Fed chairman tonight is that the fourth 
quarter is going to bring recovery. "The reason we have been rallying 
[recently] is on the hopes and dreams of the fourth quarter." 
Adding to investors' nervousness about the economy were weak housing and 
employment news. The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales posted 
their largest decline in four years in April as rising layoffs made Americans 
feel less secure about making big-ticket purchases. 
And the Labor Department said new claims for state unemployment insurance 
rose more sharply last week than analysts expected. 
It was more difficult to gauge precisely how Jeffords' move was affecting 
Wall Street, where some profit taking had been expected following the 
market's big run-up since early last month. Stocks have advanced primarily 
because of the five interest rate cuts by the Fed this year. 
The Dow has jumped 1,732.94 points, an 18.5% increase, from its March low of 
9,389.48. Nasdaq has gained 643.22, or 39%, from its April 4 low of 1,638.80. 
The market can't be expected to sustain such upward momentum as long as 
investors have reason to worry about the economy, said Alan Ackerman, 
executive vice president of Fahnestock & Co. 
"The averages moved too far too fast without any real strong earnings 
development," Ackerman said. "The market has overreacted to the cumulative 
Fed rate cuts." 
The economy and politics aside, stocks still managed to post widespread 
gains. Microsoft rose $2.02 to $71.72, and General Motors advanced $1.41 to 
$56.59. Home Depot moved up 83 cents to $53.45, and Intel rose 41 cents to 
$29.21. 
However, analysts said politics pulled down pharmaceutical and energy shares, 
sectors that typically benefit from a Republican Congress. Merck dropped 
$1.50 to $72.50 and Enron fell $1.19 to $54.16. 
The slowing economy hurt makers of semiconductor equipment, which reported 
late Tuesday that customer orders for April dropped 41% from March. Triquint 
Semiconductor plunged $4.22 to $20.59. 
Advancing issues traded about evenly with decliners on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where consolidated volume was slightly below Wednesday's trading 
pace.

Report on Business Magazine
DIGITAL ECONOMY
Dot-coms may be down and out, but the internet is still transforming 
corporations
DON TAPSCOTT

05/25/2001
The Globe and Mail
Metro
27
"All material Copyright (c) Bell Globemedia Publishing Inc. and its 
licensors. All rights reserved."

The pendulum of irrational exuberance of 18 to 36 months ago is swinging back 
to irrational orthodoxy. Typical is Harvard competitiveness guru Michael 
Porter's article in the March issue of Harvard Business Review, "Strategy and 
the Internet," in which he joins the chorus exhorting business leaders to 
"return to fundamentals" and abandon misguided thoughts of new business 
models or e-business strategies. 
Porter's line of reasoning is this: The internet arrived. Many companies 
attempted to build businesses based on the net. They were called dot-coms. 
Most crashed and burned. Therefore, building a company based on the net is 
foolhardy.
Porter asserts that "the experiences companies have had with the internet 
thus far must be largely discounted and that many of the lessons learned must 
be forgotten." Success in today's economy "does not require a radically new 
approach." Companies should stick to their time-tested processes, using the 
net as a "complement to traditional ways of competing." 
Porter divides the world into two camps: the dot-com zealots and the 
traditionalists like him. The former raved about web site stickiness and 
first-mover advantage, while the latter support concepts such as value 
creation, differentiation and profitability. And we can all see who won. 
Framed this way, much of Porter's reasoning seems rock solid. After all, who 
can defend the dot-com recklessness of 1999 and early 2000? Our grandchildren 
will marvel at the era of insta-billionaires and IPO frenzy. But even after a 
3,000-point Nasdaq plunge, must we inescapably conclude, as Porter argues, 
that the internet is more or less inconsequential? 
The answer is, no. Porter's analysis falls short for two key reasons. First, 
he grossly underestimates what the internet is and where it is headed. 
Second, he doesn't understand its impact on the nature of the firm. 
On the first point, Porter maintains the net is just "the latest stage in the 
ongoing evolution of information technology." Porter makes the all-too-common 
mistake in assuming that today's internet--a network connecting desktop 
computers--is basically the same as tomorrow's. 
This, of course, is nonsense. The net continues to soar in ubiquity, 
bandwidth and function. More than one billion people will be on-line by 2005. 
It is the means not only by which computers will connect, but the mechanism 
by which individuals and organizations will collaborate, exchange money and 
conduct transactions. Mobile computing devices, broadband access, wireless 
networks, and computing power embedded in everything from refrigerators to 
automobiles are converging into a global network. All other communications 
technologies, such as telephone, radio and television, are being sucked into 
the net's maw. 
The internet of tomorrow will be as dramatic a change from the internet of 
today as today's internet is from the primitive, unconnected, proprietary 
computing networks of yesterday. 
This leads to Porter's second major error. He fails to appreciate that this 
complex and ever-expanding communications medium will precipitate deep and 
profound changes to the structures of successful businesses. 
The 20th-century corporation did everything-it was vertically integrated. 
This model worked best because the costs and difficulties of collaborating 
with partners outside the firm were greater than performing such activities 
inside the corporate walls. 
But the digital economy is bringing forward myriad new models-fluid 
congregations of businesses, sometimes tightly structured, sometimes 
amorphous-that use the net to create value for customers in unprecedented 
ways. These new models are possible because the net smashes the costs of 
partnering. Companies can now focus on their core capabilities and partner to 
do the rest. When done properly, such business webs create better and less 
costly products and services than the old corporation. 
Established businesses such as Enron, Citibank, American Airlines, Nortel, 
Schwab and many product divisions of GE are now transforming themselves by 
partnering in areas that were previously unthinkable. Boeing CEO Phil Condit 
calls his company a systems integrator, not an aircraft manufacturer. IBM is 
a computer company that doesn't make its computers-its partner network does. 
Newer companies based on the internet, such as eBay, Travelocity and E*Trade, 
are competing well despite volatility in their stock prices. Napster is 
causing chaos in the music industry and forcing every company to rethink its 
value. Linux and the open-source movement pose a huge threat to Microsoft. 
And this is just the beginning. 
Yet Porter continues to champion the old, vertically integrated model, and 
his HBR article criticizes corporations for partnering. But we can already 
see that the traditional model is an increasingly less effective vehicle. It 
is akin to entering a Formula One race with a golf cart. No matter how 
well-built and skillfully driven, it will never win.

India Enron Panel Lacks Authority to Solve Dispute, Expert Says

     Mumbai, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- Indian negotiators lack the
authority to solve a dispute that has shut down Enron Corp.'s $3
billion power plant, India's single biggest foreign investment,
said a former member of the negotiating committee.
     The negotiators will meet Enron officials on Tuesday next
week, though any proposals made will not be binding on either
Dabhol Power Co., 65 percent owned by Enron, and the Maharashtra
State Electricity Board, the official said. Maharashtra, Dabhol's
sole customer, has refused to pay some of its power bills.
     ``Where is the guarantee Enron and the government will accept
what the committee recommends,'' said R.K. Pachauri, director-
general at the Tata Energy Research Institute, a research
organization. Pachauri said he quit the committee because it was
being asked to renegotiate the project, when it was set up to
solve the payment dispute.
     Maharashtra yesterday served Dabhol notice canceling the
power purchase contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board
notice it was set to pull out of the project in six months.
     The board has refused to pay Dabhol 3 billion rupees for
power supplied in December and January, saying the bills should
reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty it imposed on the company Jan.
28 for failing to supply power at full capacity.

                            Meeting

     Other India officials said the two parties can't afford not
to negotiate as there is too much at stake.
     Mahrashtra and Dabhol serving each other notices is ``simply
legal maneuvering,'' said Kirit Parikh, an economist on the prime
minister's economic advisory council.
     ``It won't affect the process of finding a solution because
``the ground reality is neither Enron nor Maharashtra can afford
not to find a compromise'' to the dispute, Parikh said.
     The government needs a solution as it could be left footing
the bill.
     India's federal and state governments, which have guaranteed
the board's payments for power and some of the loans to help fund
the project, may have to pay Dabhol more than 170 billion rupees
($3.6 billion) if it terminates the 2,184 megawatt power project.
     ``We are going back to Maharashtra tomorrow to work on the
problem.'' Dabhol managing director Wade Cline said. Cline was in
New Delhi to meet A. K. Basu, secretary to the ministry of power.




India's Negotiator Gokak on Dispute With Enron Unit: Comment
2001-05-25 05:35 (New York)


     Mumbai, May 25 (Bloomberg) -- A.V. Gokak, the Indian federal
government's nominee in discussions with Enron Corp.'s Dabhol
Power Co. on a dispute over dues with the western province of
Maharashtra, on the next meeting of the negotiating panel.

     ``According to me, the committee is still there. Till the
committee is formally dissolved we exist.''

     Dabhol Power said yesterday the Maharashtra State Electricity
Board, its sole customer, served notice that it's canceling their
seven-year-old power purchase contract.

     ``I have been told even today that the meeting is as
scheduled on May 29 and I will be there to attend it.
     ``There have been any number of instances where such
developments take place and the committee continues its
negotiation.''



India Govt: State Bd To Likely Pay Dabhol Apr Elec Bill

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board is likely 
to pay its electricity bill for April to U.S. energy major Enron Corp.'s 
(ENE) Indian unit, Dabhol Power Co., a senior Power Ministry official said 
Friday. 
"My understanding is that MSEB will pay up its bill for April to Dabhol Power 
under protest," the official said without elaborating.
Jimmy Mogal, Enron India's spokesman declined to comment on the size of the 
April bill. MSEB Chairman Vinay Bansal wasn't available for comment. 
Media reports have speculated that the bill was around 1.37 billion Indian 
rupees ($1=INR46.95). 
Dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. 
Critics object to Dabhol charging INR7.1 rupees a kilowatt-hour, compared 
with INR1.5/KWh charged by other suppliers. 
The $3 billion Dabhol project has been mired in financial disputes since its 
main customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, has failed to pay 
several of its bills. 
DPC confirmed Thursday that the MSEB has declared its contract to purchase 
power from the US$3 billion Dabhol plant null and void, but it said the move 
by its client was without merit.

PGE sees gains despite power costs

05/25/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Power prices may have hit an all-time high, but 
Portland General Electric showed record revenues in the first part of the 
2001. 
With earnings of $43 million for the quarter ended March 31, a 10 percent 
increase from year-ago levels, PGE clearly has stepped-up sales activity as 
wholesale electricity prices have surged.
Utility officials have told state regulators that if the good times continue, 
they will share some of the benefits with customers through credits or 
refunds. 
But the cost of buying electricity for 728,000 Oregon customers has climbed 
dramatically, and the volatility casts doubt on the possibility of refunds 
for PGE customers this fall. 
PGE's quarterly report showed revenue from wholesale power sales rose to $480 
million, three times the posting for the same period a year earlier. 
"We were able to do fairly well," said James Piro, chief financial officer 
for PGE. 
But costs also climbed dramatically. Because PGE's power plants produce less 
than half the electricity needed to serve the utility's residential and 
business customers, it buys power on the same high-priced markets into which 
it sells. It also buys natural gas to fuel some of its generators - an 
increasingly expensive commodity. 
The costs of electricity and fuel totaled $582 million for the quarter ended 
March 31, almost twice PGE's tab for the same period of 2000. 
PGE's success on the wholesale market involved luck as well as trading savvy. 
The utility anticipated a cold winter, along with the increase in demand, and 
bought an extra cushion of electricity supplies. When the season proved 
unusually mild, PGE found itself with a surplus to sell. Because prices were 
on the rise, PGE benefited from subsequent trades. 
Dry weather, however, is cutting into PGE's hydropower resources, and 
wholesale prices are easing slightly. These conditions could crimp PGE's 
ability to continue to profit from power sales and hold down earnings. 
On the other hand, if a heat wave sweeps through the region and PGE still has 
extra power to sell outside Oregon - to the Southwest, for example - sales 
revenue could surge as prices rise. 
Under a plan approved by regulators to help deal with volatile electricity 
markets, PGE will track all power costs incurred from January through 
September. If costs exceed certain levels, a rate increase will result. If 
profits exceed certain thresholds, refunds will occur. 
Whether increase or refund, regulatory review is required.

India: Pachauri rejects Godbole's remarks

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, May 24. DR R.K. Pachauri, a member of the Review Committee set up 
by the Maharashtra Government on the Dabhol controversy, has voiced his 
concern on a fellow member's recent statement in a leading national daily on 
the issue. 
In a press statement released here, Dr Pachauri has contended Mr Godbole's 
statement that, "The committee has also suggested that the judicial enquiry, 
headed by a service or a retired Supreme Court judge should be initiated as 
soon as possible."
According to Dr Pachauri, this statement needs to be seen in the context of 
the fact that three out of the five members in the committee recorded their 
strong dissent with this view. "Can the view of two members of the committee, 
clearly a minority, be read as 'the committee has also suggested...'," Dr 
Pachauri has argued. 
According to him, "Can a judicial enquiry really force Enron back to the 
negotiating table?" 
In the press statement, he has thrown up several other questions -Can the 
Maharashtra Government renegotiate a deal with Enron if a judicial enquiry is 
in progress, and would the public accept any such deal till the enquiry is 
over? And till it is over, the Maharashtra Government would continue to run 
up huge bills even as the State is unable to absorb the power generated by 
Dabhol.

Asia Intelligence Wire

NEW DELHI, May 24. INDIA and Australia have signed a protocol for 
strengthening bilateral cooperation in the areas of mining, power, 
non-conventional energy sources and coal. The protocol followed two days of 
deliberations by the Indo-Australia Joint Working Group on Energy and 
Minerals set up in 1999. 
After the signing ceremony here on Thursday, the leader of the Australian 
delegation, Mr Tim Mackey, Deputy Chief Executive Officer, Department of 
Industry, Science and Resources, said that a lot of investments from 
Australia may flow into India following the recent policy changes initiated 
by the Indian Government.
There are potential opportunities for enhanced cooperation between the 
private sectors of the two countries, he said and added that there will be at 
least three joint venture projects coming up in the power sector, some in LNG 
and gas pipelines and a few technology transfers. 
In view of the ongoing controversy about Enron Corporation's Dabhol power 
project, Mr Mackey said that Australian companies are not bothered with the 
controversy and it will not have any impact on their entry into the Indian 
power sector. 
He said that there are three proposals for supplying of liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) to potential terminals in the eastern coast of India involving 
investments worth $3 billion. 
Australian firm Woodside, he said, is a partner in Dakshin Bharat Energy 
Consortium Ltd selected by Tamil Nadu Industrial Development Corporation 
(TIDCO) to establish an LNG terminal at Ennore. 
Another Australian firm - Broken Hill Proprietaries (BHP) - to set up an LNG 
terminal in the eastern coast for which the spot is yet to be identified. BHP 
also has plans to enter the power sector in India. 
The head of the Indian team, Dr Aruna Bagchee, Joint Secretary, Ministry of 
Mines, said that this second meeting of the joint working group has yielded 
very positive results in terms of enhancing bilateral ties between the two 
countries and will go a long way in promoting Australian business community 
to come and explore the opportunities thrown open in India's mining sector. 
Australia has agreed to assist in enhancing the capacities of Indian mining 
regulatory and developmental oriental organisations like the Indian Bureau of 
Mines and the Geological Survey of India to strengthen customer and 
user-friendly basic data. 
The next meeting of the joint working committee will be held in Sydney next 
year.

India: MSEB slaps notice on DPC

05/25/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 24. THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) today issued a 
legal notice to Enron under the Indian Contract Act, claiming the power 
purchase agreement (PPA) with Dabhol Power Company (DPC) as "void". 
In the notice, MSEB has said it had been forced to "rescind" the PPA with DPC 
and is "avoiding" the contract. DPC had "misrepresented material facts" while 
drawing up the PPA and hence it is "no more bound by the contract", it said.
The notice, which has been served under Section 19 of the Indian Contract 
Act, claims misrepresentation in performance of the plant as per clauses 6 
and 7 under schedule 6 of the PPA. 
A senior MSEB official said, "we were expecting a certain level of 
performance from the plant. The contract was entered into as per assurance 
about a certain level of plant performance from DPC, which we found to be a 
misrepresentation. We are now exercising the option under Indian law of 
avoiding the contract." 
"MSEB does not have the right to rescind the PPA as attempted in their 
letter," DPC said in a statement issued here. 
" It would appear that MSEB's notice is a deliberate attempt to further delay 
the resolution of difficult issues confronting MSEB. The board has chosen an 
obscure and improper justification for attempting to rescind a contract that, 
in any event, was signed more than seven years ago. In any case, this basis 
and many of MSEB's related claims are already subject of a pending 
arbitration initiated by DPC." 
According to the MSEB official, although DPC is free to contest the notice, 
they can do so only in Indian courts. 
The relevant clauses of the PPA relate to making power available at full 
capacity within three hours. MSEB has been claiming that DPC has not been 
generating power at full capacity and had slapped three penalties of Rs 400 
crore each. It had also sought that its bills be adjusted against the amount. 
The issue had led to protracted quarrels between DPC and MSEB which ended up 
in conciliation, arbitration and now, finally, the termination notices. 
According to State Government sources, Enron had an inkling of what was 
coming. They also hinted that it could have prompted DPC to serve the 
preliminary termination notice (PTN). Banking sources too said the company 
had "feared" that MSEB may serve a termination notice. 
The board official said MSEB would henceforth not be under any obligation to 
buy power from DPC. "But since the plant cannot be shut down, we have offered 
to purchase power as per the PPA. Of course, they too are not obligated to 
supply power," he said. 
The legal notice is, however, not likely to affect the renegotiation. 
Dr Madhav Godbole, Chairman of the renegotiation panel, told Business Line 
that the legal notice would not affect the normal course of the proceedings. 
"The two processes would continue alongside," Dr Godbole said.

Centre awaits negotiations 
NEW DELHI, May 24. THE Centre is willing to consider any worthwhile idea 
emerging out of the negotiating committee for the settlement of the dispute 
between Dabhol Power and MSEB, according to the Union Power Minister, Mr 
Suresh Prabhu. 
An official release issued today states that any such proposal has to be 
acceptable to both the MSEB as well as the DPC. 
Industry sources, however, point out that the Centre's stated position is not 
likely to provide a breakthrough since the Centre has endorsed a 
consensus-driven approach with its involvement restricted to the 
participation of its member Mr A.V. Gokak in the negotiating committee. 
A meeting between Dabhol Power Company and Ministry of Power is slated to be 
held on Friday following DPC's request to the meet the Power Secretary, Mr 
A.K. Basu.

Bechtels out if dues not paid by May 31
Anto T Joseph

The Economic Times
Copyright (C) 2001 The Economic Times; Source: World Reporter (TM)

FRUSTRATED by a series of payment defaults, US-based Bechtel has threatened 
the Enron-promoted Dabhol Power Company that it will withdraw from the 
controversial project by May 31, if its dues are not paid. 
In a letter written to DPC, Bechtel which is the EPC contractor for the 2,184 
mega-watt project and also a minority stake holder (10 per cent) in DPC has 
said it was stopping civil work at the site in coastal Maharashtra.
Sources from financial institutions said that the unit I of the projects 
phase-II, which was slated to be operational commercially by June, will not 
be ready by then, after Bechtel stopped work at the site. Around 10 to 15 per 
cent of the work is yet to be completed, sources added. 
Both Bechtel and DPC refused to comment on these developments. FI sources 
said the issue will be discussed threadbare at the meeting in New Delhi on 
Friday called by the Centre. 
While Bechtel issued the May 31 deadline to DPC to make its outstanding 
payments, lenders have refused to bail out the project with any further debt 
disbursements. 
The preliminary termination notice issued by the cash-starved DPC has 
compounded the matter, according to FI sources. 
The ongoing payment impasse, involving MSEB and the state and central 
governments, has resulted in delays in payments to vendors for the second 
phase of the power project. 
On May 2, Aric Oakf, project director of Bechtel India, had said his company 
was concerned about the payment defaults. He had said that the company was 
exploring various options as per the EPC contract. 
On May 3, the Economic Times had reported that Bechtel was considering 
pulling out of the project. Though there were defaults and delays in payment, 
the company had continued with the construction work at the site. 
Sources said DPC was not in a position to change the situation, unless 
lenders soften their stance and start funds disbursal. The lenders have held 
back around $250 million payment out of the committed debt, after the project 
ran into a series of controversies. 
Bechtel, one of the largest engineering construction firms in the world, has 
set up more than 450 power plants, installed more than 6,800 kilometers of 
high voltage transmission lines, and is the leading builder of independent 
power projects worldwide.

Govt in a fix over asking NTPC to take over Dabhol
Santosh Tiwary & P Vaidyanathan Iyer NEW DELHI

05/25/2001
Business Standard

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The possibility of National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) being roped in 
to keep the 2,184 mw Dabhol power project running has been discussed at the 
highest level in the government. Enron can sell its 65 per cent stake in the 
$1 billion (Rs 4,700 crore) equity of DPC even during the six month period 
before the lapse of the preliminary termination notice, according to its PPA 
with Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The sale however will have to be 
routed through the MSEB.
The government however faces a major dilemma over asking NTPC to take over 
the project given the political ramifications of the move which could be 
construed by other states as direct bailing out of Maharashtra, sources said. 
Given the composition of the Vajpayee-led NDA government, any move towards 
taking over Dabhol through NTPC would immediately invite the ire of other 
strong allies including Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu. 
Several IPPs in Andhra Pradesh and other states are still awaiting financial 
closure. Sources said though NTPC's involvement in DPC at present was not 
advisable, they noted that the Rs 19,220-crore public sector Navratna had all 
the resources and expertise to chip in if Enron exited. With NTPC having 
piled up huge reserves of over Rs 15,000 crore, shelling out $ 650 million 
(Rs 3,055 crore) to acquire Enron's 65 per cent stake will not be a big deal 
if the Centre gives a green signal. Besides, NTPC also has expertise in 
handling dual-fuel projects based on gas and naphtha. They said NTPC had 
seven such gas/naphtha-based projects including Anta, Auriaya, Kawas and 
Gandhar. NTPC officials however declined to comment on this issue. The 
possibility of a private player picking up Enron's equity in the $ 3 billion 
power project has also not been ruled out. Sources said given the fact that 
Madhav Godbole committee recommended keeping the project alive, MSEB would 
not pose any hurdle in Enron transfering its equity to any serious Indian 
private sector company.

MSEB rescinds Dabhol PPA
Our Regional Bureau MUMBAI

Copyright (c) Business Standard

The Maharashtra State Electricity Board today rescinded the power purchase 
agreement (PPA) it had entered into with the Dabhol Power Company (DPC) on 
May 23, 1993, in response to the preliminary termination notice (PTN) issued 
to it by the power major on Saturday. The notice issued to Enron India 
managing director C Wade Kline (dated May 23, 2001) by MSEB chairman Vinay 
Bansal said: "We are now convinced that your conduct is not bona fide and as 
such we are constrained to rescind the PPA with immediate effect." The MSEB 
will file a case tomorrow with the state electricity regulatory commission.
DPC, in a release issued here, confirmed having received the termination 
notice and added: "In any case, many of MSEB's related claims are already the 
subject of a pending arbitration initiated by DPC. Our arbitration notice of 
April 12, 2001, should serve as evidence of our confidence in DPC's legal 
position and we expect that the issues in arbitration will be resolved to our 
satisfaction." The MSEB notice for its part noted: "On January 28, 2001, to 
meet our urgent requirement we instructed you to deliver your fully declared 
baseload of 657 mw within three hours. You, however, failed to deliver the 
energy required and committed a breach of the PPA. Similar defaults occurred 
on February 13 and March 29, 2001." It went on to state: "In the letter 
addressed to us after January 28, you (DPC) have admitted that your power 
plant does not conform to the PPA and is not capable of meeting the 
contractual terms in respect of crucial operating characteristics and dynamic 
parameters." MSEB has thus justified the termination of the PPA and pointed 
out to DPC that in the above mentioned circumstance it was advised of the PPA 
being void at its (MSEB's) option. DPC has been blamed by the state 
electricity board of intentionally adopting a non-cooperative attitude and 
instead embarking upon a campaign to create confusion and obfuscate issues.

USA: Business school grads rediscover energy business.
By Carolyn Koo

05/24/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Let's face it. Getting a job in the staid energy 
business hasn't exactly been considered the pinnacle of success for ambitious 
business school graduates. 
Maybe it should be, since a national energy crisis makes conditions ripe for 
a resurgence of interest in the industry from both newly minted MBAs and 
experienced executives.
At the very least, power companies won't soon go out of business given record 
profits for many in the last year at a time when dot-coms and tech companies 
are struggling or failing. 
"The industry is seen as a growth industry with a lot of happenings, and it's 
very newsy," said Randy Wheeless, a spokesman for Duke Energy Corp. , a 
traditional North Carolina utility which now trades power all over the 
country. 
After all, with the advent of deregulation, more financially-oriented jobs 
are available. Also, students are more aware of energy issues including 
blackouts in California, which have featured prominently in the headlines. 
And just last week, President George W. Bush, himself a former oilman, 
unveiled a new national energy plan to combat the crisis. 
That plan calls for the use of cleaner-burning coal and possibly nuclear 
power as well as more traditional fuels like natural gas and could open up 
brand-new avenues of employment in the business. 
Duke's Wheeless noted that the utility has seen more interest in its openings 
and, for that reason, has stepped up its recruiting at college campuses. 
That interest stems from factors like "the growth of the industry, which 
moves at a very dynamic and aggressive pace," said James Peters, a spokesman 
for Mirant Corp. , which markets electricity and natural gas and owns power 
plants from North America to Asia. 
"The hours are better than investment banking and you get the same kind of 
money," he added. 
Indeed, the power industry has undergone a sea change. Because of 
deregulation, "there are new management opportunities and new trading 
opportunities in the electricity and natural gas industries," explained 
Stephen Brown, director of energy economics at the Federal Reserve Bank of 
Dallas. 
Deregulation enabled utilities to engage in the profitable business of 
selling wholesale power across borders, opening the way for new opportunities 
that cater specifically to the strengths of people with financial 
backgrounds. 
"The new merchant energy companies have built real dynamic cultures with a 
commercial orientation and a market focus," said Ron Lumbra, an executive 
director who specializes in the merchant energy field at recruitment firm 
Russell Reynolds. 
"It's a business where there's a huge component in marketing, trading and 
structured transactions," he added. 
The MBA curriculum, with its emphasis on finance and risk management, teaches 
skills that are transferable to the new needs of energy companies. 
"With their skill set, they can go into a number of different areas, like 
strategic development, risk management, trading and anything on the 
commercial side of the business," noted Kim Pollard, a recruiter at Richard, 
Wayne and Roberts. 
This new emphasis means that energy companies are beginning to look like 
high-tech companies. "There's a real demand for talent," Lumbra said. "And 
these companies can compete with any company in any industry." 
A prime example of a new energy company is Enron Corp. , which trades 
everything from electricity to broadband to weather derivatives. Other names 
are Dynegy Inc. ; El Paso Corp. ; and Duke Energy. Mirant, for instance, 
recruits students from Duke University, University of Chicago and Rice 
University, among others. 
Exelon Corp. also stepped up its recruiting efforts three years ago, 
according to Caryl Sabine, a consultant at Exelon Power Team, Exelon's 
wholesale trading and marketing organization. 
During the recruiting season in September, Exelon will target business 
schools at Harvard, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, the 
University of Chicago, Cornell University and Carnegie Mellon University, 
among others. 
New business school graduates aren't the only ones considering a career in 
the energy sector either. 
Lumbra pointed out that at more senior levels there's also "much more 
willingness to discuss a move to the energy business," from a cross-section 
of other industries, including professional services, technology companies, 
industrial companies and financial services firms. 
That's partly because of the attention commanded by the energy crisis, which 
has included rolling blackouts in California where deregulation failed. With 
millions and even billions of dollars at stake in markets like this, 
companies are seeking seasoned executives. 
"Energy is not so much a take-for-granted kind of service anymore, where you 
just flip a switch or pull up to the gas pump," Lumbra said.

State utility cancels agreement Enron power purchase pact
By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM
Associated Press Writer

05/24/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

BOMBAY, India (AP) - A state-run utility notified the Indian subsidiary of 
U.S. power giant Enron Corp. on Thursday that it was canceling an agreement 
to buy power from the company and accused the power generator of 
misrepresenting its capacity to produce electricity. 
The notification comes four days after Dabhol Power Co., Enron's Indian unit, 
issued a preliminary notice to the Maharashtra State Electricity Board that 
it would stop selling electricity if the government company continued to 
default on payments.
Houston-based Enron confirmed it had received MSEB's notice, but said the 
utility had no legal right to cancel the purchase agreement. 
A top MSEB official told The Associated Press that the plant has failed in 
some instances to produce required power within the time frame stipulated in 
the 1995 agreement that details the purchase of power from Dabhol. 
"Over the last two years it has been established that the plant cannot 
achieve this, so the assertions made by Dabhol Power Company earlier were in 
the nature of misrepresentation," the official said. 
Controversy over the six-year-old power purchase agreement has affected the 
$3 billion project, the largest foreign investment ever in India, that is 
being set up in Dabhol, 210 miles south of Bombay. 
Indian politicians argue that Maharashtra state cannot afford the tariff of 
the naphtha-based power plant and have called for renegotiating the purchase 
agreement. 
While Enron charges MSEB with defaulting on overdue December and January 
bills of $48 million, MSEB says this should be offset by an $85.31 million 
fine it levied on Enron for not being able to supply power. 
Representatives of the federal and state government and the power utility are 
currently engaged in talks with Enron officials as part of a six-month 
reconciliation process. 
Enron described MSEB's notification as a "deliberate attempt" to delay 
resolution of the dispute. 
"MSEB has chosen an obscure and improper justification for attempting to 
rescind the contract," said Dabhol spokesman Jimmy Mogal in a statement. 
"It is clear that MSEB does not have the right to rescind the power purchase 
agreement as attempted in their letter."

     (Adds hearing details from 12th paragraph.)

     Washington, May 24 (Bloomberg) -- El Paso Corp. Chairman
William Wise agreed to testify in a federal hearing after the
judge angrily accused another company executive of dodging
questions on whether El Paso officials conspired to manipulate
California natural-gas prices.
     Wise wasn't scheduled to testify in the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission hearing, and El Paso volunteered Wise's
testimony after the judge threatened to subpoena him.
     Judge Curtis Wagner lashed out at Executive Vice President
Ralph Eads, also president of El Paso's merchant energy group,
accusing Eads of avoiding the question of whether he sought Wise's
permission to enter into a contract that plaintiffs say was meant
to drive up California gas prices.
     ``I'm just appalled that you're trying to pull this over my
head,'' Wagner said. ``If I have to subpoena (Wise) ... I am
perfectly willing to do it.''
     The judge is examining charges that El Paso's pipeline unit,
El Paso Natural Gas, sold more than a billion cubic feet of
pipeline capacity into California to its merchant energy
subsidiary, which then withheld gas shipments to drive up prices.
    Eads previously testified that he and other merchant energy
executives met with Wise to tell him about the imminent contract.
Wise didn't want to hear too many details because of FERC
prohibitions against regulated and unregulated affiliates of the
same company unfairly colluding on contracts, Eads said.
     The California Public Utility Commission, PG&E Corp.'s
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Edison International's subsidiary
Southern California Edison Co. brought the charges against El
Paso.
     The FERC is looking into why the average price of gas has
jumped almost fivefold in California this year compared to a year
earlier, and why prices there are much higher than elsewhere in
the country. Gas is used to fuel many power plants, and the
average price of electricity at the California-Oregon border has
soared more than ninefold this year.

                      Valentine's Day Meeting

     Wagner was particularly concerned about an affidavit by Mark
Mitchell, a former senior vice president with the merchant energy
unit now in charge of South American trading for the company.
Mitchell said the Feb. 14, 2000 meeting with Wise was ``prepared
in an effort to solicit endorsement of Merchant's participation in
the auction'' for the pipeline capacity.
     ``It seems to me Mr. Wise put his blessing on this,'' Wagner
told Eads. After further questioning, Wagner stated: ``Mr. Wise
did approve it.''
     ``Yes,'' Eads said.
     Wise is expected to testify tomorrow afternoon, and the trial
is expected to continue into next week.
     Wagner also released to the public a single comment from a
document El Paso officials contend must remain sealed because it
contains sensitive information about the company's business
practices.
     The line, from an April 14, 2000, memo to Wise, reads: ``We
will make money two ways: 1) increase the load factor, 2) widen
the basis spreads.''

                           Basis Spread

     California's regulators and utilities accuse El Paso of
withholding pipeline capacity to drive up the ``basis spread,''
the difference between the price of natural gas sold where it is
produced and the price at the California border. Later, after the
border price rose, the company increased shipping to take
advantage of the high price, they allege.
     According to the FERC, spot prices in California were around
$2.50 per thousand cubic feet during most of last year, similar to
the rest of the country. By December, prices had risen to between
$11.79 and $18.80 per thousand cubic feet, while in other regions
they ranged from $4 to $7.
     Eads testified that the line from the memo exonerates El Paso
because it shows the company's intent from the beginning to
increase gas shipments to California.
     El Paso thought increased gas supplies from Western Canada to
Chicago, imported on a new pipeline, would pull supplies away from
California, raising the basis spread and allowing more gas
shipments, Eads said. Instead, demand in California has taken gas
away from the new pipeline, he said.
     The material ``is meaningful in the sense that they actually
realized what they intended,'' Kevin Lipson, representing Southern
California Edison, said in an interview. ``They accomplished what
they set out to do.''
     Houston-based El Paso's shares fell $1.51 to $63.50. They
have declined 11 percent this year.

RWE Has Held Talks On Possible Purchase Of American Water

NEW YORK -- German utility RWE AG has held discussions to buy American Wate=
r Works Co., but talks between the two companies broke down abruptly late l=
ast week, people familiar with the matter said.=20
Negotiations, however, could be revived at any time, these people said. It =
wasn't clear what prompted the collapse of the talks, but American Water, w=
hich has a market capitalization of $3.3 billion, apparently called them of=
f.
An acquisition of American Water Works, the largest publicly traded water u=
tility in the U.S., would be the latest in RWE's expansion in the water bus=
iness around the world. Last year, it bought Thames Water PLC of Britain an=
d also acquired E'town Corp. of New Jersey.=20
The Financial Times reported last night on its Web site that RWE was "consi=
dering" a $3.6 billion bid for American Water Works.=20
American Water Works, Voorhees, N.J., is an aggressive buyer in its own rig=
ht. Earlier this month, it announced the purchase of Azurix North America C=
orp., the North American water-services division of Houston's Enron Corp. f=
or an undisclosed amount. It scrapped a planned acquisition of water utilit=
y SJW Corp., San Jose, Calif., earlier this year after repeated regulatory =
delays. And it is expected to soon complete a nearly two-year-old deal to b=
uy the water and waste-water assets of Citizens Communications Co., Stamfor=
d, Conn.=20
Spokesmen for American Water Works and RWE couldn't be reached for comment.=
 Mike Brophy, a spokesman for RWE's Thames Water unit, said he couldn't con=
firm the talks.

Can you free up an industry by cracking down on one big company? That is th=
e question European regulators are tussling with this summer.=20
The company involved is Electricite de France, the state-owned utility that=
 has built up a network of interests abroad while remaining largely protect=
ed at home.
The industry is Europe's Euros 400bn ( #250bn) energy sector, which despite=
 the arcane nature of such concepts as gigawatts, cubic metres of gas and i=
nterconnectors, has become one of the latest battlegrounds between the stat=
e and the free market, national interests and pan-European consolidation.=
=20
Most European Union leaders want energy, one of the few remaining sectors w=
here companies can have legal monopolies, to be fully opened to competition=
 as part of the EU's drive to become the world's most dynamic economy. The =
European Commission has prepared legislation to liberalise the electricity =
and gas sectors by 2005.=20
Tony Blair, UK prime minister, even gave the impression in a speech in Braz=
il last month that without such reforms, Britain would be less likely to jo=
in the euro. "This is a real test of our collective leadership," he said.=
=20
So far, however, it is a test Europe has flunked. France thinks the energy =
proposals are too much, too soon and that the EU should could first assess =
the effect of a previous wave of liberalisation. French officials are only =
too happy to talk of California's blackouts as an example of liberalisation=
 gone terribly wrong.=20
Germany is unhappy with the Commission's insistence that effective liberali=
sation needs a strong regulator, since it believes that further meddling co=
uld disrupt age-old ties between utilities and local government. Together, =
the two countries blocked the Commission's proposals at a summit in Stockho=
lm in March.=20
But the pro-reform leaders did win one concession at Stockholm - an instruc=
tion to Brussels to use competition law to free up the sector in lieu of th=
e promised legislation. The presidents and prime ministers told the Commiss=
ion to ensure that "enterprises which still benefit from a monopoly situati=
on on their national market will not unduly benefit from that situation".=
=20
There was little doubt which company was in their sights. EdF was already e=
mbroiled in a controversial takeover of Hidrocantabrico, an energy company =
in Spain, where politicians raged that they did not privatise utilities to =
see them snapped up by a foreign state. France stands out in Europe for hav=
ing opened up only 30 per cent of its electricity market - the minimum requ=
ired by current EU law.=20
EdF came even further into the limelight in the succeeding months, when it =
first built up a stake in the Italian industrial company Montedison and the=
n became the junior partner in a Fiat-led takeover of the group.=20
Brussels' probe of both cases will be a crucial test of whether Mario Monti=
, the competition commissioner, can provide an acceptable second-best to th=
e much longed for legislation.=20
"Being able to use competition policy to help liberalisation along is one o=
f the reasons the Commission has had against having an independent competit=
ion body," says Alec Burnside, a partner at the law firm Linklaters & Allia=
nce in Brussels.=20
Mr Monti's chief weapon may be the concessions the acquiring companies agre=
e to make in order to see the takeovers through. Such a process is a long d=
rawn out one. Next month, EdF will begin to auction a sizeable chunk of its=
 capacity in France as a "remedy" to its acquisition last year of a stake i=
n the German power company EnBW. Its rivals say that the progress of the au=
ctions will be an important test of the Commission's ability to open the Fr=
ench market to competition.=20
Meanwhile, Brussels has to decide by tomorrow whether to unleash a full sca=
le investigation on the Montedison acquisition, which could end in further =
"remedies". And by October 8, it will decide the fate of the Hidrocantabric=
o deal - settlement could involve giving EdF's rivals more access to the "i=
nterconnectors" that export electricity from France to Spain.=20
But the competition directorate, with a staff of only 446, has limited time=
 and resources to spend on freeing up Europe's energy markets. Other merger=
, cartel and state aid cases also crowd the agenda.=20
"Competition remedies are helpful but by their nature these are piecemeal a=
pproaches," says Peter Styles, vice-president at Enron, a Houston-based ene=
rgy-trading company.=20
Indeed, no German energy companies have been subjected to the attention lav=
ished on EdF - although the German market is on some measures even less ope=
n than the French.=20
Certainly, leaders like Mr Blair appear to have concluded that competition =
policy is no long term substitute for energy reform. Commission officials h=
ope to make real progress on the pending legislation by the end of the year=
, leaving only the target date for full energy liberalisation to be resolve=
d. But such hopes presuppose that Germany will overcome its doubts about a =
regulator - and that, after that, France will be willing to agree on some s=
ort of date. Lionel Jospin, French prime minister, has given no indication =
on that so far.=20
The most important deadline is the EU's Barcelona summit in March 2002, whi=
ch will judge progress on a range of economic fronts. But for now, where en=
ergy liberalisation is concerned, Mr Monti is just about the only game in t=
own.=20

BOMBAY, India -- The chairman of Houston-based Enron Corp. told India's pri=
me minister that he had not advocated U.S. sanctions against India if the c=
ompany fails to get the $1 billion it spent to build a controversial power =
plant here, a company official said Sunday.=20
Kenneth Lay had outraged Indian officials with his reported comments in an =
interview with the Financial Times, slamming the government over the projec=
t--India's largest foreign investment.
Lay was quoted as saying by the paper: "If they try to squeeze us down to s=
omething less than cost then it basically becomes an expropriation by the I=
ndian government, and that would send an incredibly damaging signal to the =
international capital markets and investment community as to making any fut=
ure investments in India."=20
He reportedly told the newspaper that there are U.S. laws "that could preve=

 to India going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of U.S. comp=
anies."=20
Chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh of Maharashtra state, where the plant is l=
ocated, criticized what he called "the strong-arm tactics of Enron."=20
The plant stopped production in May after its sole customer, the Maharashtr=
a State Electricity Board, canceled a 7-year-old power purchase agreement. =
Enron says the board had no right to cancel.=20
Federal representatives and officials of the Dabhol Power Corp., an Enron s=
ubsidiary, are trying to resolve differences that have threatened to shut d=
own the $3-billion project.=20
The two-phase project was to be the world's biggest natural gas-fired power=
 plant, able to generate 2,184 megawatts once completed.=20
In a letter to Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, Lay said, "I have not a=

Utility commission boosts San Diego rates, recoups state money
By DON THOMPSON
Associated Press Writer

08/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - California regulators moved Monday to recoup the state's =
electricity purchases, boosting rates for San Diego customers an average of=
 12 percent and blocking big businesses from bypassing utilities to buy pow=
er.=20
The California Public Utilities Commission also delegated much of its futur=
e ratemaking authority to the California Department of Water Resources. Cri=
tics said that gives Gov. Gray Davis' administration too much freedom to ra=
ise rates to buy power on behalf of three struggling utilities.
San Diego Gas & Electric residential customers who use less than 130 percen=
t of a basic amount of electricity would see no increase under rates that c=
ould be adopted Sept. 6. The higher rates could kick by Sept. 15.=20
SDG&E spokesman Art Larson said 130 percent of baseline equals about 328 ki=
lowatts per month. While about 40 percent of the utility's residential cust=
omers fall below that baseline, the typical residential consumer uses about=
 500 kilowatts a month.=20
Residents who use more than 130 percent of that baseline amount would see a=
n average increase of 12.49 percent under a tiered rate structure designed =
to promote conservation.=20
San Diego residents using up to twice the baseline would see a 6.04 percent=
 increase; up to three times the baseline would see would see an average 12=
 percent increase; and those using more than three times the baseline would=
 see a 22.29 percent rate boost.=20
Small commercial customers would pay 18 percent more; industrial users face=
 a 19 percent increase; and agriculture a 14 percent increase. There is no =
baseline for other than residential customers.=20
Larson said the company is reviewing the decision, but SDG&E gets none of t=
he rate increase. It all goes to repay the state for buying electricity for=
 the utility's 1.2 million customers.=20
No one outside the SDG&E territory would have their rates increased under M=
onday's proposals, and rates could drop if natural gas prices keep falling,=
 said commission President Loretta Lynch.=20
However, other commission orders affect how much of existing rate increases=
 go to utilities instead of DWR to repay $13 billion worth of state bonds r=
eady for sale.=20
The commission's proposal shifts about $500 million a year from Southern Ca=
lifornia Edison to Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to cover what the commissio=
n says are higher costs of providing electricity in Northern California.=20
That amount is subject to ongoing lawsuits, although Lynch maintained the d=
ivision proposed by the commission should cover the reasonable costs of bot=
h the utilities and DWR.=20
PG&E said the proposed shift "discriminates against PG&E's customers."=20
The proposed division would cost PG&E customers 40 percent to 55 percent mo=
re to pay back DWR over the next 10 years than it would cost Edison or SDG&=
E customers, said spokesman Ron Low. He said it was unclear if PG&E rates w=
ould have to increase. An Edison spokesman had no immediate comment.=20
Lynch said the commission is shortening its usual monthlong comment period =
to just one week so the state's bond sale can proceed quickly this fall.=20
She said the commission had little choice but to delegate much of its futur=
e ratemaking authority to the department, under legislation approved earlie=
r this year that enabled the state to buy power on behalf of the three cash=
-strapped utilities. The state will be repaid by the $13 billion raised by =
the bond sale, which requires a revenue guarantee before it goes ahead.=20
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Ri=
ghts, called the decision a "devastating and costly dereliction of the PUC'=
s duty.=20
"They're abdicating their responsibility under the state constitution to mo=
nitor and scrutinize the purchases of power," Rosenfield said.=20
Lenny Goldberg of The Utility Reform Network agreed but did laud the commis=
sion's decision to cut off utility customers' ability to buy electricity ou=
tside utilities after July 1 as "absolutely necessary." Legislators earlier=
 ordered an end to what is known as direct access, but left it to the commi=
ssion to set a termination date.=20
Customers who contracted for power with private companies before then will =
be allowed to complete those contracts, said commissioner Carl Wood. But th=
e retroactive date was included to block other customers from unfairly anti=
cipating the commission's action and signing late contracts to avoid higher=
 rates necessary to repay the state bond, he said.=20
That decision primarily affects large industrial users, as well as Houston-=
based Enron Corp.'s burgeoning retail sales in the state, Wood said. Enron'=
s wholesale sales to utilities would not be affected. An Enron spokesman ha=
d no immediate comment.=20
The decision to block outside electricity purchases for as many as 15 years=
, until the bond is repaid, marks another retreat from California's flawed =
1996 deregulation law.=20
But Lynch argued the $13 billion is already being spent to keep California'=
s lights on. Now that debt must be repaid by those who already used the ele=
ctricity.=20
About 16 percent of California's electricity load had been direct access la=
st year, but that dropped to less than 1 percent once the electricity crisi=
s hit, Lynch said.=20

DENMARK: ANALYSIS-Wind makers give mergers the thumbs down.
By Birgitte Dyrekilde

08/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

COPENHAGEN, Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. energy group Enron is meeting heavy goi=
ng in its efforts to sell its wind turbine arm Enron Wind, with top industr=
y players saying the firm is too expensive and there is no need to consolid=
ate.=20
"The safe way is to grow organically in an industry expanding as fast as wi=
nd power and our strategy is to grow on our own," said Johannes Poulsen, Ch=
ief Executive at Danish Vestas Wind Systems , the world's largest supplier =
of wind turbines with one third of the global market.
"We have not even considered buying Enron Wind."=20
Independent wind power consultancy BTM estimates the global windpower marke=
t will grow by an annual average rate of 19 percent over the coming 10 year=
s.=20
Enron Wind has unofficially been up for sale for several years and an Enron=
 spokesman recently told Reuters he hoped a deal would be completed this ye=
ar.=20
The world's number four wind turbine manufacturer, Danish NEG Nicon , is no=
t considering acquiring the U.S. firm either.=20
"At present we have no acquisition plans and that includes Enron Wind. We b=
elieve organic growth can bring us a long way from here," NEG Micon Chief E=
xecutive Torben Bjerre-Madsen said.=20
Also Danish private-owned Bonus sees no need to buy growth. The company's m=
arket share, in terms of megawatts (MW) has doubled to 11.5 percent in 2000=
 from 1998 organically.=20
TOO EXPENSIVE=20
But German-Danish Nordex , which was listed on the German Neuer Markt in Ap=
ril, is actively seeking potential acquisition candidates and has been talk=
ing to Enron Wind but has been scared off by the price.=20
"You can buy technology via an acquisition or a market position which it wo=
uld take you longer to obtain organically," said Carsten Pedersen, member o=
f Nordex AG's management board.=20
"We have been in negotiations with Enron Wind, but the company is too highl=
y valued and the price is only getting higher," he said.=20
The case for buying Enron Wind is weakened by the company's recent performa=
nce. Its market share has halved from 13.5 percent in 1998 to six percent l=
ast year, despite the acquisition of German rival Tacke during this period.=
=20
The Financial Times said last week that Enron's wind turbine unit was value=
d at $725 million.=20
NEG Micon, with a market share more than twice as big as Enron Wind's, was =
worth $860 million based on Monday's share price, while Nordex with a marke=
t share of 8.3 percent was worth $280 million.=20
Including its 40 percent stake in Spanish Gamesa Eolica , Vestas Wind Syste=
ms has a market capitalisation of $3.95 billion.=20
Nordex aims to double its market share to above 20 percent over coming year=
s.=20
"We are observing all movements in the market and we would reach our goal f=
aster through acquisitions," Nordex's Pedersen said.=20
The company has also been in talks with a smaller rival, Spanish Made, with=
 a global market share of around two percent.=20
"Made was also too expensive. This industry is euphoric, all companies comp=
are themselves with Vestas," Pedersen said.=20
Analysts also cite German Dewind with two percent of the market as an obvio=
us takeover candidate following postponement of its planned IPO last year.=
=20
NO NEED TO CONSOLIDATE=20
Analysts and manufacturers say lack of synergies and technical benefits are=
 the main reasons for the low level of consolidation among top players in t=
he industry.=20
"Basically there is no need to merge in this sector. The market is growing =
very fast and companies can improve sales on their own," said head of Bonus=
 Energy, Palle Noerregaard.=20
"It is hard to find technological advantages from acquisitions and also syn=
ergies are difficult to see," Noerregaard said.=20
Analysts and windmill makers still await traditional, cash-rich industrial =
conglomerates to enter the lucrative market.=20
General Electric was seen as the most likely industrial buyer of the U.S. w=
ind power unit followed by engineering groups Swiss-Swedish ABB , Germany's=
 Siemens and French Alstom .=20
Another likely outcome is a financial investor buying Enron Wind. European =
private equity company Doughty Hanson & Co bought wind power blade manufact=
urer Danish LM Glasfiber in the spring, saying it planned to launch an IPO =
in five years.

"Enron has made it clear it would consider completion of the project only a=

Indian State Blocks AES Plan to Exit From Power Venture

Indian State Blocks AES Plan to Exit From Power Venture

     Mumbai, Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- An Indian state government
blocked a plan by AES Corp., a U.S.-based power generator, to give
up its stake in a power distributor. An administrator was
appointed to take charge of the unit.

     AES last week offered to give its 51 percent stake in Central
Electricity Supply Co. to the utility's employees for virtually
nothing to rid itself of the money-losing contract. AES is barred
by contract from selling its share before 2004.

     Cesco, 49 percent owned by the government of the eastern
state of Orissa, will ``take over control and management of the
business but still keep us an investor,'' Venu Nambiar, director
at the AES Transpower unit, told reporters. ``We don't understand
why they are going through this. We offered to sell it back to
them at no cost.''

    At least five foreign-run power companies face payment
problems or have withdrawn investments from India, citing delays,
bureaucracy and the slow pace of reforms. Their exit may hurt
India's economy, which needs $200 billion to double generating
capacity and avoid the power failures that are common in many
Indian cities.

    Cesco is owed $85 million because of power thefts and unpaid
bills. It ceased paying its 8,500 employees this month, leading to
protests from the workers.

    AES hasn't received details of the order passed by the state
government and didn't know who had been appointed as an
administrator, Nambiar said. ``We don't know the extent of the
order yet.''

    Enron Corp., a rival, has been trying for seven months to
resolve a dispute over $64 million in unpaid bills from the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its only customer. Enron,
which invested $875 million in a $3 billion power plant, has
offered the government its 65 percent stake in the project at
cost.

     Arlington, Va.-based AES owns stakes in 173 power plants
generating 59,000 megawatts worldwide, including utilities in the
U.S. and Latin America.

     AES shares were little changed at $34.13 in recent trading.


Enron's Indian Lenders May Fund Dabhol Expansion (Update1)
2001-08-27 12:59 (New York)

Enron's Indian Lenders May Fund Dabhol Expansion (Update1)

     (Adds details from CEO's letter in paragraphs eight to 10.)

     Mumbai, Aug. 27 (Bloomberg) -- Indian lenders said they're
willing to make new loans to Dabhol Power Co., Enron Corp.'s local
unit, to complete its power project only if the government
guarantees repayment.

     ``We are looking at many options,'' said A.K. Doda, executive
director at Industrial Development Bank of India, one of the
biggest local lenders to Dabhol. Still, ``we aren't close to
deciding on any one of them.''

     Doda wouldn't say what other plans the banks are considering
to salvage the $3 billion power venture, India's biggest foreign
investment. The 740-megawatt power plant was shut in May after a
dispute over unpaid bills between Dabhol and Maharashtra state,
and work on a second phase to add 1,444 megawatts of capacity
stalled in June after 95 percent of the work was completed.

     Indian banks, which have loaned $1.4 billion to Dabhol, have
the most at stake, without guarantees on their loans. The $600
million lent by ABN Amro, Bank of America Corp. and other overseas
banks is covered by government guarantees. India risks having to
pay fines of as much as 170 billion rupees ($3.61 billion)
resulting from guarantees on power payments and loans.

     Enron owns 65 percent of Dabhol and is owed $64 million by
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, its sole customer, in
unpaid bills for eight months. The board in May stopped buying
power, saying it's too expensive. Enron wants to exit the project
and said it's ready to sell its stake to the government at cost.
It has invested $875 million in the project.

     Indian banks would have to disburse about $320 million for
completion of the second phase of the project, which includes a
liquefied natural gas import and storage facility. Contractors
stopped working on the expansion in June because they hadn't been
paid since April.

     Life Insurance Corp. and General Insurance Corp., two of the
country's biggest state-run life insurers, may be included in a
plan to buy out Enron's stake in the power project, the Economic
Times said. Dabhol officials are scheduled to have a series of
meetings with local lenders this week, the paper said.

                           Lay's Letter

     Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Ken Lay said in a letter
sent to India's prime minister and finance minister over the
weekend that the company would prefer the Indian government and
Indian lenders buy out the Dabhol project, spokesman John Ambler
said. Failing that, he said the company would have no option but
to terminate the contract. Enron in May filed a preliminary
termination agreement to end the contract in six months.

     In his letter, Lay further distanced himself from a report in
Friday's Financial Times that quoted him saying the Indian
government could be subject to U.S. sanctions unless Enron and its
partners recover $1 billion they invested in the Dabhol project.
Lay told the Indian government leaders that his comments were
mischaracterized and that Enron hasn't asked the U.S. government
to impose sanctions.

     The company said in a statement Friday that Lay was ``merely
referring to U.S. laws that, under extreme circumstances, exist to
protect the interests of U.S. companies doing business in
countries that have economic relationships with the U.S.
government.''

     Enron shares rose 68 cents to $37.03 in early afternoon
trading. They have fallen 55 percent this year.


Positive views on Dabhol problem - Meeting with Tata Power MD

Is a just denouement of the controversial Dabhol power project possible? At=
 this stage, the outlook is depressing. The Madhav Godbole committee, tryin=
g to renegotiate the project, is facing an uphill task, with Enron, the chi=
ef promoter, not willing to give substantial concessions. And even announci=
ng its intention to quit. Ultimately, whether the DPC can be revived or not=
 will depend on how effectively the project is restructured. And that in tu=
rn will depend on finding a buyer for Enron's sizable stake and in concurre=
nce with the new owner reworking the project to the satisfaction of all the=
 stakeholders. That course looks daunting for now but is the only worthwhil=
e option available.=20
The Godbole committee did a commendable job in identifying the faults of th=
e original project. Those had contributed to a thoroughly one sided agreeme=
nt. However, in its second incarnation of trying to renegotiate the project=
, the committee has apparently met with little success. Which shows how muc=
h more difficult it is to reconstruct a project than condemning it.
The DPC has been pointing out that it has iron-clad contracts in the form a=
 power purchase agreement (PPA). At this stage, what should be of primary c=
oncern are: (a) Enron and its co-promoters have created worldclass assets i=
n a critical infrastructure sector, (b) It is imperative to productively us=
e those assets for the benefit of the whole nation, (c) The continuing fail=
ure to honour the PPA reflects poorly on India's image.=20
The urgency to renegotiate is obvious. There is already a time and cost ove=
rrun to the project. In that context the news that one of India's most resp=
ectable business houses would be interested in stepping into the shoes of E=
nron has created plenty of excitement. Recently in Mumbai The Hindu spoke t=
o Mr. Adi J. Engineer, Managing Director of Tata Power. His views are both =
illuminating and realistic.=20
How it all began=20
Actually it was in reply to a shareholder at the recent AGM of Tata Power t=
hat the issue of (the Tatas) buying up the Enron stake in the Dabhol power =
project was first raised. Asked as to whether the Tata group was seeing an =
opportunity in the DPC, Mr. Engineer had merely said that like any company =
in the power sector "we will evaluate every opportunity but will only seize=
 those opportunities that add value to our services." In Orissa where the p=
rivatisation of power distribution was undertaken a few years ago, Tata Pow=
er was the best equipped to take over the central zone. But the terms and c=
onditions stipulated by the company were not accepted. The party which even=
tually took over is now complaining.=20
Referring to the DPC, Mr. Engineer - privately - shares the anxiety of thos=
e who say from a distance that you should not go anywhere near this particu=
lar project. As very experienced operators in the power sector, they will g=
o in only if the terms and conditions are suitably altered. "And the terms =
and conditions will have to be altered because we already have a mega proje=
ct on the ground that cannot be wished away, the contract may not be good f=
rom the buyer's or the consumer's angle but the plant is good as a physical=
 asset. Can the whole thing be restructured to make it sensible for the cou=
ntry and the new buyers? These are some of the things that will have to be =
examined in detail and only when we are fully satisfied that it can be rest=
ructured will we think of getting in," he said.=20
The Godbole committee looking into some of the aspects will look at it from=
 a government point of view. Tata Power has about 85 years of experience. W=
e should be able to judge whether it makes sense... If it does and is accep=
table to other parties then we move forward, he said. "The issue is simply =
this: here is a private power company which is the largest in the country. =
It is but natural that the external parties who want to solve the problem w=
ill first look at a party with a proven record. That is the stage we are in=
. We are not saying that we are hell bent on taking it over. If we feel it =
can be turned around we will take a decision at the appropriate stage."=20
Mr. Engineer would not like to comment on issues such as restructuring of t=
he tariff as they affect the sensitivities of all the stakeholders of the D=
PC. But surely they will be addressed. For it is in the government's intere=
st also to arrive at a solution sooner rather than later." We have to put o=
ur heads together to find out how this great asset worth thousands of crore=
s is not allowed to rust and instead be put to use. Tatas have the longest =
exposure to the power sector and they are capable of solving it, but it can=
not be done individually: the co-operation of all the agencies will be requ=
ired.=20
The DPC ought to be seen as a problem that requires a national solution. "I=
f in that process it is recognised that we are a company which has always s=
tood by the shareholders and consumers then we will surely have a role."=20
The DPC (imbroglio) ought to be seen as a problem that requires a national =
solution, says the Managing Director of Tata Power. "We have to put our hea=
ds together to find out how this great asset worth thousands of crores is n=
ot rusted but used productively."

IN HOLDING OUT the threat of US sanctions against India over the Dabhol imb=
roglio, Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman of Enron, the energy conglomerate that own=
s DPC, has displayed poor tactical finesse. For neither the substance of th=
e threat (sanctions) nor the circumstances warranting their imposition have=
 little application, at least not at the present juncture.=20
Mr Lay has spoken of American laws that could prevent Washington from provi=
ding aid or assistance or other things to India if there is expropriation o=
f US property. That may be so. But there has never been at any time a sugge=
stion from New Delhi that it would not honour its contractual obligation in=
 the Dabhol case. Nor does the track record suggest such a possibility. Ind=
ia knows only too well that its long-term commercial and strategic interest=
s lie in staying within the four walls of international law. All that can b=
e said about DPC is that a contractual dispute has gone for arbitration as =
per the terms of the contract itself (this must be added) and the arbitrato=
r is yet to give his award. It is only when the award is announced and the =
counter guarantor, the Government of India, refuses to implement the award =
can there be any question of expropriation. By his needless reference to sa=
nctions (which strike an emotive chord in Indian minds), Mr Lay is only ant=
agonising those sections in India which might otherwise be inclined to view=
 the company's case with sympathy. Worse, the effort could be misinterprete=
d in the State Department as a crude attempt at arrogating to oneself the c=
onduct of the US foreign policy - something even a chairman's proximity to =
the US President might not justify.
The timing of Mr Lay's outburst is significant. One, there is a team of fac=
ilitators trying to reconcile New Delhi's position and Enron's for a satisf=
actory solution to the impasse. Then, in parallel, an international arbitra=
tion on the contractual dispute between the Maharashtra State Electricity B=
oard and Enron is in progress. Yet Mr Lay has chosen to take the dispute to=
 the media. Perhaps he knows well that neither of these two approaches is g=
oing to guarantee Enron a speedy resolution of the dispute. Also, Mr Lay se=
ems a man in a hurry. He has just taken over the day-to-day management of E=
nron from the predecessor CEO for a second term at the top. This is at a ti=
me when the company's market capitalisation has dropped by more than 55 per=
 cent since the beginning of the year. He has to be, therefore, seen as doi=
ng something to turn things around. To add to his woes, Enron faces some un=
certainty over earnings prospects because of its foray into the broadband c=
ommunication business. Its corporate image too has taken a beating with all=
egations of manipulation of energy prices in California. The last part is p=
articularly significant in the context of its dispute with India. For even =
if it wins the arbitration award in the Dabhol case, it may turn out to be =
a pyrrhic victory.=20
The situation, then, is tailor-made for NGOs in the developed world to run =
a campaign to the effect that the company has bribed politicians in a Third=
 World country and written for itself a one-sided agreement to the detrimen=
t of starving millions. In the aftermath of Seattle, civil society in the W=
est has come into its own. With the California price-gouging controversy fa=
r from having died down, a legal victory in Dabhol is not what it is lookin=
g for, considering its potential for causing damage to its image in the US,=
 its main market. A settlement with the Government of India that would allo=
w it an honourable exit from a blighted project is the only option that wou=
ld make sense to it. The resources freed in the process can be applied else=
where without any fear of a backlash. The Government must, therefore, seize=
 the initiative and work out a settlement that secures the interest of both=
 parties.

What gives? Has the Internet economy turned completely upside down?=20
Yes, it has. That besieged company, energy trader Enron Corp., the cover su=

Certainly, Enron has other troubles. Its broadband business, for instance, =

Some of that higher volume can be attributed to the energy crunch, as Enron=

THE NATION SUNDAY REPORT Bush's Energy Plan Bares Industry Clout Cheney-led=
 task force consulted extensively with corporate executives. Its findings b=
oosted their interests. Environmental groups had little voice.

WASHINGTON -- Throughout February and March, executives representing electr=
icity, coal, natural gas and nuclear interests paraded quietly in small gro=
ups to a building in the White House compound, where the new administration=
's energy policy was being written.=20
Some firms sent emissaries more than once. Enron Corp., which trades electr=
icity and natural gas, once got three top officials into a private session =
with Vice President Dick Cheney, who headed the energy task force. Cheney d=
id "a lot of listening," according to a company spokesman.
Many of the executives at the White House meetings were generous donors to =
the Republican Party, and some of their key lobbyists were freshly hired fr=
om the Bush presidential campaign. They found a receptive task force. Among=
 its ranks were three former energy industry executives and consultants. Th=
e task force also included a Bush agency head who was involved in the sensi=
tive discussions while his wife took in thousands of dollars in fees from t=
hree electricity producers.=20
The final report, issued May 16, boosted the nation's energy industries. It=
 called for additional coal production, and five days later the world's lar=
gest coal company, Peabody Energy, issued a public stock offering, raising =
about $60 million more than expected. While Peabody was preparing to go pub=
lic, its chief executive and vice president participated in a March 1 meeti=
ng with Cheney.=20
The report also touted new gas extraction technologies. An early draft note=
d controversy over a gas recovery technique offered by Halliburton Co., the=
 firm Cheney ran from 1995 to 2000, before becoming vice president. The pla=
n released to the public deleted the negative language.=20
Cheney continues to resist demands by Congress to disclose who met with adm=
inistration officials during the 106 days earlier this year when the energy=
 plan was fashioned. The private nature of the work fostered candid and cre=
ative discussions "from new and unused quarters," said Cheney Press Secreta=
ry Juleanna Glover Weiss.=20
But interviews and a review of task force documents show how the administra=
tion relied on familiar faces who stood to benefit from the process.=20
Just once, the task force departed from its pledge to keep secret the names=
 of people invited to pitch their opinions face to face. After producers of=
 power from the sun, wind and geothermal heat met with Cheney, officials le=
d the group to the front of the White House and waiting reporters.=20
The date was May 15, just one day before the plan was sent to President Bus=
h.=20
Others whose views might conflict with industry--the Union of Concerned Sci=
entists, the Sierra Club, even federal agency staff--found themselves shut =
out or overruled.=20
In the sessions they held while they worked on the plan, Cheney and his sta=
ff generally heard a message reinforcing their own mind-set: Free markets, =
fewer pollution rules and expanded development of traditional fuels.=20
Using less energy and energy in different forms were notions mentioned but =
not emphasized. "What do you expect?" asked one energy industry insider who=
se colleagues met with Cheney. "These people make their living from coal an=
d natural gas and nuclear power. Do you think they're going to push for sol=
ar and wind?"=20
The influences are evident in the final product.=20
The report focuses on easing regulation for oil and gas drilling, coal-fire=
d generators, nuclear power plants and transmission of electricity, while p=
roviding energy assistance to poor households. Though the plan also backs a=
lternative fuels and conservation, it gives the most support to increasing =
the supply of traditional sources of energy.=20
One passage adopts word for word a proposal on global warming from the U.S.=
 Energy Assn.'s National Energy Strategy, which is dominated by trade group=
s. The section suggests encouraging other countries to build factories with=
 clean technologies sold by U.S. companies.=20
Even basic assumptions in the report were tailored to industry's measure.=
=20
A briefing paper prepared for a March 19 task force meeting with Bush said =
that, "on the whole, U.S. energy markets are working well, allocating resou=
rces and preventing shortages." But two months later, the final task force =
report proclaimed that "America faces the most serious energy shortage sinc=
e the oil embargoes of the 1970s."=20
The energy situation hadn't changed. One staffer recalls seeing a memo that=
 discussed "utilizing" California's rolling blackouts and the past summer's=
 high-priced gasoline to press for more drilling for gas and oil.=20
The task force began work in late January, nine days after Bush's inaugurat=
ion.=20
By all accounts, the vice president dominated the meetings. Energy Secretar=
y Spencer Abraham; Bush's chief economic advisor, Lawrence B. Lindsey; and =
Environmental Protection Agency Chief Christie Whitman were the others with=
 the most to say, one administration official said. But everyone jumped in =
on matters outside his or her own immediate jurisdiction.=20
There was no shortage of private energy experience. Besides Cheney's stint =
as Halliburton's chief executive, Commerce Secretary Don Evans ran an oil c=
ompany and Lindsey served on an Enron advisory board.=20
The committee still gathers on occasion, most recently last month, to monit=
or progress of its recommendations. The House of Representatives passed an =
energy measure that reflects the plan. Once the Senate votes next month and=
 the two houses of Congress sit down to negotiate a final bill, "we'll be b=
ringing a lot of pressure to bear," Weiss said. "Our objective is to get th=
at legislation as close to the policy as possible."=20
To Howard "Bud" Ris, who heads the Union of Concerned Scientists, the proce=
ss represents an opportunity lost. He disagrees with the report's conclusio=
ns but says he would have felt better if task force members and staff had t=
horoughly explored all sides.=20
"They should have done a really rigorous review. They foreclosed all kinds =
of options."=20
Electricity=20
If any group had the White House wired, it was the electricity industry.=20
The director of its major lobbying arm, the Edison Electric Institute, room=
ed at Yale University with George W. Bush. Electricity generators and marke=
ters contributed $19.7 million to Republicans since 1998, roughly double wh=
at they gave Democrats, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. An=
d electricity companies negotiated contracts with administration friends, p=
olitical operatives and, in one case, a family member.=20
Take Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National Committee. I=
n the spring of 2000, the Bush campaign recruited him to help with strategy=
.=20
A year later, as a lobbyist for several electricity producers, he pushed Bu=
sh and Cheney to renege on a campaign promise to restrict power plant emiss=
ions of carbon dioxide. The gas has been linked to global warming.=20
On March 1, Barbour sent a sternly worded memo on the subject to Cheney. "A=
 moment of truth is arriving," the note began. Complying with carbon dioxid=
e limits would be so expensive that Bush should reverse his position, Barbo=
ur argued.=20
"Clinton-Gore policies meant less energy and more expensive energy," he wro=
te. "Most Americans thought Bush-Cheney would mean more energy, and more af=
fordable energy."=20
Within weeks, Cheney's task force had adopted the same reasoning on carbon =
dioxide. Bush cited the task force position when he announced in March that=
 he had changed his mind.=20
The National Electric Reliability Council, an industry trade group, hired f=
ormer Montana Gov. Marc Racicot as a Washington representative. Racicot was=
 a close Bush advisor during the tumultuous postelection days in Florida.=
=20
Racicot said he met with Cheney and his energy director, Andrew Lundquist, =
on the subject of the EPA's forcing old plants to update their clean air eq=
uipment.=20
The task force report suggested that the Justice Department consider droppi=
ng lawsuits it has already brought for alleged violations.=20
Three electricity companies employ Diane Allbaugh as a lobbyist. She is mar=
ried to Joe Allbaugh, the only member of Bush's so-called iron triangle of =
trusted Texas cohorts to serve on the energy task force. During meetings of=
 the panel, Joe Allbaugh always took a chair at one end of the table, with =
Abraham to his right and Whitman to his left. He serves by virtue of his po=
sition as director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.=20
In her most recent disclosure reports in January, Diane Allbaugh said that =
the three firms--Reliant Energy, Entergy and TXU, paid her $20,000 apiece i=
n the previous three months. She wrote that she did no lobbying on their be=
half. The companies say she performed other consulting duties.=20
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the company is "actively supporting=
" the energy plan, but Diane Allbaugh's "minimal assignments have not invol=
ved the task force, specifically to avoid any specter or allegation that th=
ere is a conflict of interest." She is a consultant on "Texas-related" issu=
es, he said.=20
Spokeswomen for TXU and Entergy said Diane Allbaugh's work for them is like=
wise restricted to their Texas operations.=20
Meanwhile, her husband, Joe Allbaugh, has participated in task force talks =
with a direct bearing on the energy companies' interests generally, such as=
 environmental rules for power plants and electricity deregulation--a speci=
alty of his wife's.=20
At least twice he was privy to updates from economic advisor Lindsey on Cal=
ifornia's malfunctioning market, where Reliant stands accused by the state =
of overcharging. The company denies any wrongdoing.=20
Joe Allbaugh's spokeswoman, Christi Harlan, said that nothing "about the si=
tuation would suggest that the director would need to seek ethics guidance"=
 and added that his wife's lobbying reports "are going to have to speak for=
 themselves."=20
Diane Allbaugh declined comment. Visited at the townhouse that the Allbaugh=
s bought in March from the Cheneys, she said: "I appreciate the effort you'=
ve gone to, but I don't think we're going to talk."=20
In 1996, the Dallas Morning News reported that she represented clients with=
 interests in pending Texas state deregulation of telecommunications and ut=
ilities markets, while her husband served as then-Gov. Bush's chief of staf=
f. At the time, Bush said he was troubled "if it creates a public perceptio=
n that something unfair is taking place."=20
At the time, she wrote the governor's counsel that she was withdrawing from=
 her contracts. And Bush instituted a policy that division heads and senior=
 aides could not be married to registered lobbyists, according to Texas new=
spapers.=20
As president, Bush has no special guidelines beyond those of the Office of =
Government Ethics, said White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan. These regula=
tions appear less stringent, prohibiting participation only if a particular=
 matter applying to a specific company is addressed.=20
TXU Chief Executive Erle Nye--a client then and now--said Diane Allbaugh ha=
s been a consultant on deregulation issues. She registered as a lobbyist, h=
e said, just in case she happened to talk about a pertinent issue to a poli=
tician. "To my knowledge, we would not have let her lobby," he explained, "=
because she is the wife of Joe."=20
Natural Gas=20
Natural gas was connected in high places too.=20
When the Energy Department drafted a chapter for the report about how to in=
crease domestic energy production, the text mentioned the importance of hyd=
raulic fracturing, a method of accelerating production of natural gas wells=
. It so happens that Halliburton is a major provider of the service.=20
Chemicals and sand are injected under high pressure into gas-bearing geolog=
ical formations, causing underground cracks. The gas rises into the cracks =
and moves closer to the well, making recovery easier.=20
The process has its foes. Neighbors of natural gas wells in Alabama complai=
ned of oily goop and sulfur smells streaming out of faucets just after a co=
mpany conducted fracturing. An Alabama federal appeals court ordered the st=
ate to regulate the process--and EPA to step in if needed. Natural gas dril=
lers, and hydraulic fracturing purveyors, expect similar lawsuits to be fil=
ed in the Rocky Mountain states, according to material submitted to the tas=
k force by the Domestic Petroleum Council.=20
The EPA is studying whether hydraulic fracturing is linked to water well co=
ntamination but doesn't expect to finish its preliminary inquiry until at l=
east February. The agency will decide then if further research is warranted=
, officials said.=20
Halliburton complained in federal court, during Cheney's last year at the c=
ompany, that new federal restrictions on the process would "have a signific=
ant adverse effect" on its business.=20
The Energy Department chapter mentioned the environmental controversy as we=
ll as the potential of hydraulic fracturing. With the Energy Department cha=
pter in hand, a Cheney assistant informed an EPA official in late March tha=
t hydraulic fracturing would go on the April 3 agenda for the Cabinet-level=
 gathering. The agency was advised to prepare a recommendation.=20
EPA officials balked at suggesting any actions for the task force before th=
e study was completed. The subject disappeared from the agenda by the day o=
f the meeting.=20
But it didn't disappear from the final report. The document emphasized the =
technique's importance as "one of the fastest-growing sources of gas produc=
tion" and noted that "each year nearly 25,000 oil and gas wells are hydraul=
ically fractured." The information about potential water well contamination=
, the appeals court decision and the possibility of EPA controls had all be=
en dropped.=20
A few paragraphs after the hydraulic fracturing discussion comes the task f=
orce recommendation that the nation "promote enhanced oil and gas recovery =
from existing wells through new technology."=20
Halliburton spokeswoman Wendy Hall said company executives did not discuss =
the energy report with Cheney. "Of course, we talk to him; you don't work w=
ith someone for that long and then not talk to him. But not about the plan,=
 and not about hydraulic fracturing."=20
Coal=20
Perhaps the biggest winner in the task force report was coal.=20
Though coal produces more than half of the country's electricity, natural g=
as dominates the next generation of power plants. The reason: clean air rul=
es. Burning coal produces a significant amount of carbon dioxide, which has=
 been linked to global warming, and other elements tied to acid rain and sm=
og.=20
Under President Clinton, " 'coal' was a dirty word," said John Feddock, an =
industry analyst based in Bluefield, Va.=20
Not so under Bush, whose U-turn on carbon dioxide was the coal industry's b=
iggest victory in Washington in years.=20
"If rising electricity demand is to be met, then coal must play a significa=
nt part," the task force report stated. The plan recommended spending $2 bi=
llion in federal money for research into making coal-fired electricity clea=
ner. And the task force recommended directing federal agencies "to provide =
greater regulatory certainty relating to coal electricity generation."=20
"The president is friendly to energy, and so is the vice president, and tha=
nk God," said Fred Palmer, a vice president at Peabody Energy, the world's =
largest coal producer. "Our society needs energy."=20
Peabody, an affiliate called Black Beauty Coal and their employees have dir=
ected $900,000 to Republican coffers over the last two years. Peabody Chief=
 Executive Irl F. Engelhardt personally gave $100,000 to Bush's inaugural c=
ommittee.=20
Two Peabody executives and one from Black Beauty were named to Bush's energ=
y advisory team after his election victory.=20
Two weeks after the task force was formed, Peabody announced plans to make =
a public stock offering. Several weeks later, on March 1, Palmer and Engelh=
ardt attended a coal-interests meeting with task force members Abraham and =
Lindsey and Cheney's energy director.=20
On May 21, five days after the task force report touted coal, Peabody's sto=
ck went on sale. The company received $420 million, about $60 million more =
than analysts expected.=20
Could Peabody have gone public if Al Gore had beaten George W. Bush?=20
"That's an interesting question," Palmer said. "We'd been working on [the s=
tock offering] for a long time. But it picked up steam this year, no questi=
on. I am sure it affected the valuation of the stock."=20
Conservation=20
Environmental leaders say they never got a real chance to influence the rep=
ort in favor of greater conservation efforts and renewable power.=20
Just after the election and again in January, when the task force was annou=
nced, several groups requested meetings with Bush, Cheney or both.=20
Months passed without a reply.=20
Dan Becker, legislative director at the Sierra Club, heard suddenly from an=
 Energy Department staffer in late March: Please give us your thoughts on t=
he plan. We need them within 24 hours. Then, he says, the caller mentioned =
that Abraham was traveling and wouldn't be reading the response.=20
On April 3, the Energy Department submitted a briefing paper on nuclear pow=
er to the vice president's office, recommending the U.S. use more of it. Un=
der "pros," the paper noted that this policy would be "a bold step" and add=
ed that it would underscore "the responsible approach of the administration=
 towards carbon emissions"--the global warming issue.=20
But under "cons," the paper noted: "Environmental groups will sharply criti=
cize any proposed expansion" because of waste disposal issues and the histo=
ry of accidents at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. Environmentalists will =
"use the proposal to fund-raise and organize to defeat the administration's=
 policy, and use the proposal to suggest our national energy policy is out =
of the mainstream." Nuclear power would go on to win a place in the report =
as "a major component of our national energy policy."=20
By this time, the task force was well aware that environmentalists would be=
 unhappy about many aspects of the report.=20
The panel had already abandoned its original plan for a release date of Apr=
il 6. It was too close to Earth Day, a staffer with knowledge of the discus=
sion said, and it would offer much too tempting a target.=20
In this wary atmosphere, Lundquist met April 4 with 15 emissaries from envi=
ronmental groups.=20
The assembled activists barely had time to introduce themselves in the allo=
tted 50 minutes. "To characterize it as meaningful consultation is quite a =
stretch," said Elizabeth Thompson, who attended for Environmental Defense.=
=20
Ris, from the Concerned Scientists, asked twice to meet directly with Chene=
y "to no avail," according to a memo written afterward by one of the partic=
ipants.=20
Environmental leaders finally sat down with Cheney on June 5, weeks after t=
he report was released.=20
The environmentalists' clear anti-Bush sentiments during the election campa=
ign sealed their fate, said William K. Reilly, who headed the EPA when Bush=
's father was president.=20
"They have roles to play," he said. "But they're not going to be insider ro=

Enron using pressure tactics?

LONDON, AUG. 24. In what is seen as pressure tactics, the U.S. power compan=
y, Enron, has warned that Washington could impose new sanctions against Ind=
ia if it does not pay up the full $1 billion that Enron claims it spent on =
setting up a power plant in Maharashtra.=20
The Enron chairman, Mr. Kenneth Lay, told The Financial Times today that no=
n-payment would amount to "expropriating" a U.S. company which could invite=
 economic sanctions under American laws, besides sending a "damaging" signa=
l to international investors. "There are U.S. laws that could prevent the U=
.S. Government from providing any aid or assistance or other things to Indi=
a going forward if, in fact, they expropriate property of U.S. companies", =
he said.
He pointed out that India had indicated its willingness to solve the disput=
e amicably and the two sides were working with an international reconciliat=
ion team, but he did not rule out an alternative to continuing with arbitra=
tion. "We have very, very tight contracts, and we'll enforce those contract=
s", he said.=20
The Financial Times underlined the fact that "Mr. Lay is known to have warm=
 relations with the Bush administration which has its roots in the company'=
s home base of Texas."

Away from the daily grind / Skilling explains departure / Former Enron CEO =
wants more time for family, new adventures
LAURA GOLDBERG
Staff

08/25/2001
Houston Chronicle
3 STAR

(Copyright 2001)

RECENTLY departed Enron Corp. CEO Jeff Skilling wants to learn to speak a f=
oreign language fluently, travel in Africa, master dirt- bike riding and, m=
ost importantly, spend more time with his family.=20
"I'm like a lot of people," said Skilling, who took on his first full-time =
job at 14 and turns 48 in November. "I've worked too hard for too long. It =
kind of builds up. You know there's things that you miss. There are things =
that you would like to do that you have never done."
Skilling caused a stir on Wall Street and in Houston's business community w=
hen a week and a half ago he unexpectedly announced he was leaving Enron af=
ter just six months as its chief executive.=20
He cited personal and family reasons for the departure. Enron Chairman Ken =
Lay, who has returned to his former chief executive role, said in ironclad =
statements that Skilling wasn't forced out and that no troubling company di=
sclosures would be following.=20
Some observers have a hard time believing Skilling would freely leave the c=
ompany he worked so hard to transform from a pipeline concern into an energ=
y-trading giant, while others noted that Enron's stock price had fallen fro=
m $82 a share at the end of February to under $43 right before Skilling's a=
nnouncement.=20
Skilling became Enron's president and chief operating officer in 1997 and w=
as named chief executive in December effective in February.=20
In an interview at his newly built River Oaks home Friday, several hours be=
fore leaving to go camping and fishing with one of his three children, Skil=
ling said he's not sure he ever aspired to be chief executive of Enron.=20
"I was working to build a company, build an institution," said Skilling, wh=
o joined Enron in 1990 after working with the company as a consultant in hi=
s job with McKinsey & Co.=20
At age 14, Skilling took a job at a television station in Aurora, Ill. (the=
 same Aurora put on the map by Wayne's World). He began painting the walls =
as the station was being built and ended up as its chief production directo=
r. His shift started at 3:15, after school, and he signed off at midnight.=
=20
Throughout his undergraduate and business school years, he also worked.=20
Skilling, who is divorced and shares custody of his children, finally reach=
ed a point in his career where he felt it was time to do something else.=20
"I don't understand why people don't get that," said Skilling, who is engag=
ed to be married. "I've worked for 34 years. I deserve a break. I honestly =
believe that."=20
He said he hasn't spent the time he should have with his parents, brother, =
sister and children. His job, which was a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week e=
nterprise, required him to travel 50 to 60 percent of his time.=20
Skilling, Houston's fifth-highest compensated executive at a publicly owned=
 company last year based on a survey done for the Chronicle, said he's luck=
y he can leave.=20
"A lot of people work hard all their life, and they really don't have an op=
tion," he said. "I have options."=20
His recent trip to England, where three employees were killed and another s=
eriously burned in an accident at an Enron power plant, also hit him.=20
"It reinforced how transitory life is," he said. "For 34 years, I've always=
 assumed I would have something afterward. All of a sudden you realize ther=
e may not be an afterward unless you get going. . . . If something is impor=
tant to you, you probably ought to go ahead and do it."=20
But what of Enron's stock drop, and why didn't he leave before taking over =
as CEO?=20
"It's no fun to watch your stock price go down when you are having record e=
arnings," said Skilling, who still owns about 1 million shares in Enron and=
 has vested options for additional shares.=20
While all sorts of factors entered into his decision, including the stock p=
rice, he stressed again that his reasons for leaving were "personal and fam=
ily."=20
"If people come back and write the history of Enron Corporation, they'll lo=
ok at my tenure as CEO. It was not great for the stock price. I wish it was=
n't that way. It is what it is. I think what I would ask and I would hope p=
eople would look at is what earnings did."=20
The price was battered for a number of reasons, including worries about Enr=
on's potential exposure from California's energy crisis, the collapse of it=
s new broadband business and continued problems with a power plant project =
in India.=20
Previously, those issues demanded his attention and now, Skilling said, the=
 California crisis has passed and Enron's broadband costs have been pared.=
=20
Skilling's big near-term hopes for the broadband business were dashed when =
the telecommunications industry suffered a meltdown.=20
"I didn't realize it would get this bad this fast," Skilling said. "Who wou=
ld have thought? Everybody blew it. I blew it, too."=20
All told, Skilling believes Enron is in strong shape for the future.=20
Don't expect Skilling to lounge somewhere on a beach. He'll open an office =
after he returns from camping.=20
He wants to do something - what, he's not exactly sure yet - to get the wor=
d out that Houston is a good place to incubate innovative and important bus=
inesses.=20
"There is no place, in my view, that is as good for building as Houston, Te=
xas, is," said Skilling, who may try to leverage his relationships with a n=
umber of business schools around the country to achieve his goal.=20
He's also interested in continuing and expanding on his charity work. He wa=
nts to stay involved in multiple sclerosis fund-raising and would like to d=
o hands-on work such as home-building.=20
Don't be surprised if he tries to create a new business at some point. But =
not at least for a year or two.=20
"I think that there will be some new big idea," he said. "I don't know what=
 the big idea will be."

Bush Adviser Rove Owns Stock in Major U.S. Firms
By Jim VandeHei
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

WASHINGTON -- President Bush's chief political strategist owns hundreds of 
thousands of dollars worth of stock in companies potentially affected by the 
president's top legislative priorities, newly released federal records show. 
Karl Rove, one of the president's most trusted advisers on almost every major 
legislative initiative, owns between $100,000 and $250,000 of stock in Enron 
Corp., Pfizer Inc., General Electric Co., Boeing Co. and Johnson & Johnson, 
among other holdings. (Federal law requires public officials to report their 
assets, income and debts in broad ranges only). All of these companies could 
be affected by one or more of the policies or legislative initiatives on 
which the president consults Mr. Rove: tax cuts, increased defense spending, 
an industry-oriented energy policy and health-care reform.
Mr. Rove said yesterday that he has been waiting for several months for 
approval from the Office of Government Ethics to sell all of his stock 
holdings and roll the proceeds into a diversified account without having to 
pay capital-gains taxes, as permitted by federal law. In the meantime, "I 
have had to avoid being involved in matters that specifically and materially 
affect my specific holdings," Mr. Rove said. 
Mr. Rove said he filed his financial disclosure reports Dec. 30 and was later 
informed by the Office of Government Ethics that he should sell all of his 
stock holdings to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
But the government ethics office, which couldn't be reached for comment 
yesterday, has yet to officially grant Mr. Rove a certificate of divestiture, 
which would allow him to roll his proceeds into diversified accounts, 
according to White House spokeswoman Anne Womack. It appears that Mr. Rove 
has lost tens of thousands of dollars as a result of the delay because most 
of his stocks have lost value since the beginning of the year. 
Mr. Rove insisted that he has been careful to avoid any discussions that 
directly affect companies he is invested in, as federal conflict-of-interest 
laws require. But that can't be easy for Mr. Rove, widely regarded as one of 
the most powerful and influential figures in the White House. Mr. Rove serves 
as the president's top political adviser and runs the administration's 
long-term strategy team. He is also the president's top liaison to outside 
groups, including corporations. 
"He's involved in virtually every decision that is made here," says a White 
House aide. It is unclear how many times, if ever, Mr. Rove recused himself 
from discussion inside the White House. 
President Bush, already under fire from Democrats for his administration's 
close ties to industry, is likely to draw more scrutiny as a result of the 
new disclosures of financial links between top White House officials and 
major U.S. corporations, especially energy firms. 
The White House disclosed the personal finances of Mr. Rove and several other 
top administration officials at the behest of the media. It appears that as a 
result of an administrative backlog, Mr. Rove is the only member of the 
senior staff who hasn't been given the green light to sell his stock, 
according to a White House aide. 
The reports show that Mr. Rove was one of several White House officials with 
a financial connection, past or present, with Enron and other energy 
companies. Larry Lindsey, the president's top economic adviser who helped 
draft the energy plan, received $50,000 from Enron in 2000 for consulting 
work he did for the company, the documents show. 
Lewis Libby, chief of staff to Vice President Dick Cheney, who was chairman 
of the White House task force that wrote the energy plan, recently sold tens 
of thousands of dollars of stock in Enron and other energy companies, 
including Texaco Inc., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chesapeake Energy Corp. It is 
unclear when the transaction went through. 
Clay Johnson, director of presidential personnel, reported holding between 
$100,000 and $250,000 in El Paso Energy Partners LP. And National Security 
Adviser Condoleezza Rice had $250,000 to $500,000 worth of Chevron Corp. 
stock and was paid $60,000 last year for her work as a director at the 
company. Mr. Rove disclosed smaller holdings in BP PLC and Royal Dutch/Shell 
Group.

JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine oil 
companies yesterday, a move that marks the first major foreign investment in 
its energy sector since the industry was nationalized in the 1970s. 
The expected deal, valued at $25 billion at least, involves the development 
of three natural-gas fields in the kingdom, as well as a number of related 
power plants, transmission pipelines and water-desalinization projects.
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the 
lead manager on two of the projects, including the $15 billion Ghawar Core 
Venture 1 project. It also will lead the Red Sea Coast Core Venture 2 
project. Royal Dutch/Shell Group was chosen to lead the Shaybah Core Venture 
3 project. 
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from oil 
burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude oil 
for export. 
The other companies selected were BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., 
Phillips Petroleum Co., Occidental Petroleum Corp., Enron Corp. and Marathon 
Oil Canada Inc. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 after tension caused by the 
Arab oil embargo against the West that began two years earlier, and it closed 
its energy exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Exxon Mobil has $5 billion 
in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the country, and it said it 
is also the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other hydrocarbons 
from Saudi Aramco.

JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia -- Saudi Arabia signed agreements with nine 
international oil companies Sunday, a move that marks the first major foreign 
investment in its energy sector since nationalizing the industry in 1975. 
The deals, worth a total of $25 billion or more, involve the development of 
three natural gas fields in the kingdom and a number of related power plants, 
transmission pipelines and water desalinization projects.
The Western companies will help Saudi Arabia convert its utilities from 
oil-burning to natural gas, which would free up more of the kingdom's crude 
oil for export. 
Exxon Mobil Corp., the world's largest publicly traded oil company, is the 
lead manager on two of the projects, including the $12-billion-to-$16-billion 
Ghawar Core Venture 1 project. It also will lead a second core project. Royal 
Dutch/Shell was chosen to lead a third project. The last two projects have a 
value of $7 billion to $10 billion each, Prince Saud al Faisal told 
reporters. 
The other companies selected were BP of Britain, TotalFinaElf of France, 
Conoco Inc. of Houston, Phillips Petroleum Co. of Bartlesville, Okla., 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. of Los Angeles, Enron Corp. of Houston and 
Marathon Oil Co. of Houston. 
Harry Longwell, director and senior vice president at Exxon Mobil, said the 
financial terms of the deal are still being discussed. But he said his 
company is ready to begin the work when the final contracts are signed. 
"The Saudis' expectations are extremely aggressive," Longwell said. "It's a 
very tight schedule and in recognition of that, the ability to get this done 
is one of the key reasons we were chosen to lead two of these ventures. We 
already have a senior management team in place and are ready to go to work 
immediately." 
Saudi Oil Minister Ali Ibrahim Naimi said the companies are expected to 
profit on returns from the exploration and development of gas fields with 
more than 15% of the investment cost. 
Saudi Arabia's state-owned energy company, Saudi Aramco, will be an equity 
owner in the projects. 
Saud said if the companies discover oil, they will be compensated and the 
fields will be repossessed by Saudi Arabia. 
Saudi Arabia nationalized its oil fields in 1975 and closed its energy 
exploration and production sectors to foreign investment. 
Although locked out of the production of energy, Irving, Texas-based Exxon 
Mobil has $5 billion in refining and petrochemical joint ventures in the 
country and is the largest foreign purchaser of crude oil and other 
hydrocarbons from Saudi Aramco.

THE BUDDHA SAYS that we take wisdom where we find it. Perhaps the Buddha does 
not say that, but it's not a bad idea anyway. The Buddha would have said it, 
maybe, had he not been saying the other things. 
Our enemies can teach us lessons. Our adversaries can make us stronger. They 
can be consumed with greed and contempt, their very breath can be toxic, and 
yet their actions can open upward-flowing paths.
Take Enron, the energy company, or Chevron, another energy company, or El 
Paso Natural Gas, yet another energy company. These organizations are the 
minions of Satan. They pillage and they profit. They are in the ascendant. 
Their enemies fall before them like cordwood. Ordinary citizens cower and 
meekly hand over tribute. 
And yet we thank them. We send our investigators after them and we pray that 
their executives land in jail, but we thank them. They have shown us the 
nature of our enslavement. They have defined the nature of our sloth. 
We have believed the Big Lie. We have believed in the free lunch. We have 
trusted those who would pander to us. We have eaten energy in great dripping 
gobs. Did we know it was not infinitely renewable? Oh yes. Did we understand 
that energy companies could create "shortages" whenever they wanted merely by 
closing plants for "maintenance"? You bet we did. And did we confuse the 
energy companies with charitable organizations and/or alchemists able to 
repeal the laws of nature? We did not. 
But it was more convenient to forget those things, and so we did. We have 
busy lives. We must do the things we must do. The infrastructure is 
everywhere crumbling, and we are patching it up ourselves. We are paying 
bureaucrats with taxes, but the bureaucrats are inadequate, so now the spirit 
of volunteerism is much praised. 
Volunteers are people who do jobs that other people are being paid to do but 
don't. 
AND SOMEHOW, EVEN in a society as relentlessly materialistic as this one, we 
forgot about our own checking accounts. Already seduced by the idea that 
credit card debt is good clean fun, we decided to waste a lot of money using 
energy we didn't need. 
I'm not talking about using a washing machine instead of going down to the 
river and beating your clothes with small stones -- I'm talking about washing 
machines with quarter-full loads and settings far too powerful for the task 
at hand. Right? Lights burning in unoccupied rooms. Appliances plugged in but 
never used. 
We pay for it. We send our wonderful money straight to the largest villains 
in American commerce because we are too stupid to do anything else. You 
wonder why they have contempt for us. You wonder why Dick Cheney believes he 
can fool all of the people all of the time. Because he has. 
Look: Last week the secretary of commerce suggested means-testing Social 
Security -- that is, means-testing a pension plan. You gave us the money, we 
kept it for 40 years, now -- prove that you need it! 
Why did he suggest that? Because he can! Why did PG&E demand additional 
compensation for its executives, who are moral dimbulbs and social criminals 
under any fair definition? Because they can get away with it! They will get 
away with it! You watch! 
I AM NOT saying that we have no one to blame but ourselves. There are active 
villains, and there are people who allow villainy to occur. Everyone in a 
corrupt system is corrupt. The fools are the ones who don't end up with any 
extra money. 
We are the fools. If we understand our foolishness, we begin to be wise. We 
send lovely bread-and-butter notes to Enron -- once we were blind, but now we 
see. And we await developments, or create them.

WASHINGTON INSIGHT
Gloom today, glut tomorrow

A.19

WHAT GOES UP usually comes down. And few industries are more prone to boom 
and bust than energy. 
Imagine the news stories a few years from now: "Crisis hangover -- energy 
stocks sink as prices plunge; But California consumers still stuck with high 
bills."
"The energy industry is suffering its worst downturn since the supply glut of 
the 1990s, as dozens of big new power plants come on line, and the 
just-completed Alaskan gas pipeline sends natural gas prices to their lowest 
levels in six years. 
"The one bright spot for Texas generators is California, where consumers are 
locked into long-term contracts for wholesale electricity that the state 
signed at the peak of its blackouts in the summer of 2001. 
"Sacramento lawmakers have appealed to President Daschle to help get the 
state off the hook, arguing that California will never claw its way out of 
its economic slump if businesses continue to flee to states where energy is 
cheap. 
"But top Enron lobbyist Gray Davis, a former governor of California, warned 
Daschle that suppliers would have little choice but to go to court to enforce 
the contracts the state signed." 
Washington and Sacramento are agog with the energy crisis and bursting at the 
seams with plans to fix it. But the one thing no one - - even 
environmentalists -- suggests is letting high energy prices discourage energy 
consumption or encourage new supplies. 
"To economists, letting the price rise is the solution," said Paul Portney, 
president of Resources for the Future, a Washington think tank. "To elected 
representatives, having the price go up is the problem." 
Political memories tend to be selective and short. But it was the energy glut 
of the 1990s that contributed to California's blackouts, $3 gasoline and 
$400-a-month heating bills. Likewise, high prices are now laying the seeds of 
their own destruction. 
As a story in the New York Times noted, an energy investment boom "promises a 
cyclical increase in supplies that is expected to stabilize or reduce prices 
in coming months, many industry executives and private analysts say." 
Through much of the 1990s, there was a glut of energy. Fuel of all kinds was 
really cheap. 
How cheap? Adjusted for inflation, as cheap as in 1949, economists calculate. 
Energy is the oxygen of the economy, and rock-bottom prices contributed to 
the long economic boom. But low prices also caused energy production to slump 
and consumption to soar. 
People ditched their economy cars for SUVs. Houses got bigger, ceilings got 
higher and kitchens sprouted industrial stoves with enough BTUs to melt 
aluminum. Stores, offices and homes turned into summertime refrigerators. 
Low prices discouraged energy development. 
"Oil was so cheap for so long, that people were selling their refineries," 
Portney said. "You had virtually no exploration for new natural gas when 
prices were at $2 a BTU." 
As demand soared and supply fell, prices rose. Profits have grown so robust 
that green fuels, such as biomass and wind, are becoming economically viable. 
The oil industry is booming. Refineries are expanding. The long-delayed 
construction of a natural gas pipeline from Alaska now looks likely. So many 
power plants are under construction that the market may be flooded with as 
much as 200,000 new megawatts by 2004. 
Investments in energy efficiency -- from new-age superconducting transmission 
wires to better light bulbs -- are suddenly looking attractive for the first 
time in decades. 
"High prices will dampen demand, high prices will encourage supply, and will 
encourage people to make better use of what they've got," said Robert Ebel, 
director of energy for the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 
"So we're starting on the down slope. We're not very far down. When prices 
start to decline, I can't say how far they will go. But they will decline, 
because that's just the law of supply and demand. Prices decline, demand 
starts to creep up again, there's less incentive to add to supply, and here 
we go again."

INDIA: Rating firms may be judging India harshly-analysts.
By Vidya Ranganathan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Analysts have reacted with surprise to last week's 
decision of ratings agency Fitch to cut India's sovereign ratings outlook to 
negative from stable, and say there are no grounds to downgrade the country. 
Fitch, which rates India's foreign currency obligations at BB-plus, a notch 
above Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's, cited concerns about 
fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in foreign investment climate.
However, economists speculated it could either be on account of Fitch 
adjusting its ratings in line with other global agencies, or a fallout of 
U.S. energy giant Enron Corp's threat to exit an Indian power venture over 
payments problems. 
Moody's and S&P said on Friday they have not revised ratings or outlook but 
are disappointed with fiscal reform efforts. 
Local currency and stock markets reacted nervously to the announcement, but 
economists said most concerns were exaggerated. 
"When the direction of reforms is positive and government flows are 
improving, the outlook should not change," said Mohan Nagarajan, chief 
economist at local rating agency CARE Ltd. 
Even if the provocation for the rating review was the Enron episode, analysts 
said the problems were specific to the power sector and will not affect the 
robust foreign investment the country has been receiving. 
"Enron was a bad deal, made on unreasonable terms in the first place and does 
not reflect the ability of the government to pay its dues," said an economist 
with a U.S.-based fund. 
Some of the confusion arises from the various ratings assigned to India. 
Moody's has retained a positive outlook on its Ba2 rating since late 1999, 
while S&P has a stable outlook and a BB rating. 
CONCERNS OVERSTATED 
Analysts said none of the factors Fitch cited had deteriorated in the past 
year, since it first rated India. 
Fitch said India's fiscal-monetary mix was unfavorable, real interest rates 
were high and there was the risk of a debt trap. 
India marginally overshot its budgeted fiscal deficit in 2000/01 
(April-March) to 5.2 percent of GDP, down from the previous year's 5.6 
percent. 
But laws to control government spending are awaiting parliament's approval, 
there are incentives for disciplined state governments and a determined 
effort at privatising state-run firms has begun. 
Burgeoning fiscal deficits have persisted for a decade and public debt at 60 
percent of GDP is high, but at six percent annual growth, India is one of the 
fastest expanding economies in Asia. 
"In terms of external liquidity, India is much stronger than its BB+ rating 
while even its public debt to GDP ratio is lower than that of some Asian 
nations," said P.K. Basu, chief economist for South East Asia at Credit 
Suisse First Boston, Singapore. 
Foreign investment has been pouring in - portfolio flows at $2.2 billion so 
far in 2001 are at record levels and compare with $1.56 billion for the whole 
of 2000 - and foreign exchange reserves are strong at $42.8 billion. 
Interest rates and yields have also dropped, with the Reserve Bank of India 
(RBI) adopting an aggressive easing stance this year to prop the slowing 
economy, and inflation is benign. 
"The hardest initial steps are being taken and there is still a lot of 
inertia, but soon there will be a willing audience and reforms can progress 
faster," CARE's Nagarajan said. 
But critics said the changes were still very superficial and structural 
reforms that would spur long-term growth and demand were lacking. 
"What the rating agencies have emphasised is fiscal consolidation, which 
means better revenue streams, efficient expenses, user charges for public 
utilities...we promised these three years back and haven't moved very far on 
those," said Saumitra Chaudhari, economist with local rating agency ICRA Ltd. 
"We still do not have a securities bill, mature debt market and our banks 
have not cleaned up,".

INDIA: India rupee ends off lows, fwds close higher.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - The rupee ended unchanged on Monday, recovering 
from the day's low after a large European bank sold dollars, dealers said. 
It had slipped to a low of 47.04 per dollar in early deals on dollar 
purchases by a jewellery importer.
The rupee ended at steady at d47.01/02 per dollar. 
Dealers said there was no impact of Friday's comments from international 
rating agencies which had raised concerns over continuity of foreign 
investment and dragged shares lower. 
The currency recovered from lows around 47.085 on Friday, reacting to 
international rating agency Fitch's revision in the outlook for India's 
ratings on sovereign debt to negative from stable, citing worries about 
fiscal policy, privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign 
investment climate. 
Later, rating firms Moody's and Standard & Poor's (S&P) said they were 
disappointed over the government's reform effort. 
Moody's also raised a concern about India's Maharashtra state utility's 
ongoing tussle with Houston-based Enron Corp and said: "the dispute indicates 
that India's government may not be willing to live up to its contractual 
obligations". 
It added this would further deter foreign direct investment from coming into 
the country. 
The comments weighed on bond prices, which extended losses on Monday, and in 
turn led to paying in dollar forwards. 
"After a long gap, there was corporate paying interest in forwards today," a 
dealer with a state-run bank said. 
The six-month forward ended at an annualised 5.10 percent compared with 
Friday's 4.95.

UK: Spectron trades UK's first post-NETA spark spread.

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, June 4 (Reuters) - Energy brokerage Spectron said late on Friday it 
had traded the first brokered gas-electricity arbitrage, or "spark spread", 
deal in the UK since the launch in March this year of new electricity trading 
arrangements (NETA). 
"Now that liquidity has returned to the electricity market post NETA, such 
transactions are expected to become more common...", said Spectron in a 
statement.
The deal was concluded between UK utility Powergen and U.S. energy group 
Enron . 
Spectron said the trade, covering winter 2002, was for 60 megawatts of 
electricity at 21.42 pounds a megawatt hour and for 100,000 therms of gas at 
24.85 pence a therm. 
The winter period specified in the deal ran from October 1 to March 31. 
For the electricity, one day was defined as 2300 hours to 2300 hours. 
For the gas, one day was 0600 hours to 0600 hours. 
The deal comes as the industry moves to create standard terms and conditions 
for spark spreads. 
Powergen is due to meet in mid-June with other traders, including Aquila 
Energy , for talks aimed at agreeing standard terms. 
"It is hoped that the market will soon establish standardised documentation 
leading to a standardised product that will help promote liquidity in one or 
more levels of efficiency," said Spectron.

INDIA: Enron India lenders meet in Singapore on Tuesday.
By Sriram Ramakrishnan

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - Lenders to Enron Corp's troubled Dabhol Power 
Company begin a two-day meeting in Singapore on Tuesday to try and settle 
differences over continued support to a controversial $2.9 billion power 
project in India. 
Representatives of some of the world's largest banks like Citibank , ABN AMRO 
, and Bank of America, will be at the meeting. Indian lenders like the 
Industrial Development Bank of India , State Bank of India and ICICI will 
also participate.
Market analysts speculate that the meeting will attempt to forge a joint 
stand on supporting the project which now produces 740 MW of power and is 
slated to increase it to 2,184 MW shortly in its second phase. 
But it comes against a backdrop of rising tension between Dabhol and the 
Indian state utility, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), which 
is the sole buyer of Dabhol's electricity. 
Indian lenders, who have lent the bulk of the funds to the plant, want to 
continue supporting the project. 
But they are being opposed by offshore lenders who want to withdraw their 
loans. Loans of around $638 million of the offshore lenders are covered by 
guarantees provided by Indian institutions. 
The Indian lenders, fearing for their profitability if the foreign banks pull 
the plug, plan to oppose any such move. 
But they have been forced on the backfoot by MSEB's decision last week to 
stop buying power from Dabhol and terminate its 1995 contract with the 
company under which it agreed to lift the entire output. 
The MSEB has complained that Dabhol produces costly power while Dabhol has 
blamed MSEB for defaulting on payments worth $48 million. 
Last month, Dabhol issued a preliminary notice to terminate its contract to 
sell power. It has also filed for arbitration in London. This provoked MSEB 
to haul Dabhol before a local regulatory body, the Maharashtra State 
Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC), which issued a temporary order 
staying the arbitration proceedings. 
The dispute has already affected India's image among foreign investors. 
Last week, global rating agency Moody's expressed concern over slippage in 
the Indian government's reform programme and cited the Enron's dispute as an 
example that the country may be losing credibility with foreign investors. 
"The dispute indicates that India's government may not be willing to live up 
to its contractual obligations. As a consequence, this would further deter 
foreign direct investment from coming into the country," Moody's said. 
India's federal Power Minister Suresh Prabhu tried to dispel those fears in 
an interview with Reuters on Sunday. 
"India is always in favour of making sure that international contracts are 
respected," he said. "There is no need for concern." ($1 = 47 Indian rupees).

INDIA: UPDATE 1-India's Prabhu says power reforms enter new phase.
By Clarence Fernandez

06/04/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

BOMBAY, June 4 (Reuters) - India's reforms of its sputtering power sector 
have entered a new phase, with plans afoot to free up private supply, 
overhaul debt-ridden state utilities and recraft tariffs, Power Minister 
Suresh Prabhu told Reuters. 
With investors' fears fanned by a squabble between U.S. energy giant Enron 
Corp and a local utility, Prabhu said in an interview late on Sunday that 
India is standing behind international contracts.
"Sanctity of contracts has to be kept," Prabhu said. 
The row began late last year when the utility in western Maharashtra state 
defaulted on payments of $48 million to Dabhol Power Company, 65 percent 
owned by Enron. The 2,184 MW power project is India's largest foreign 
investment, at $2.9 billion. 
Prabhu has vowed to take Indian reforms in a new direction. 
"Absolutely," he said in reply to a question whether India's reforms have 
entered a different phase. The Power Ministry will now also focus on power 
distribution, he added, besides its early preoccupation with generation 
needs. 
"In India unfortunately for the last 10 years...reforms policy was skewed in 
favour of generation," he said. "We never really realised that distribution 
is the more important part of the process." 
Prabhu added, "We have now decided we will make enough structural changes in 
distribution so that at the end of distribution enough investment is made." 
CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT 
A chartered accountant, Prabhu hails from the verdant regions of India's 
western coastal strand, and chaired a co-operative bank that was one of the 
country's largest, in terms of deposits, before his foray into politics. 
An errant lock of hair straying across his forehead, Prabhu eschews the 
Indian politician's traditional uniform of starched white handspun cotton for 
the shirtsleeves and trousers preferred by the professionals who have entered 
government, and whom local media call "technocrats". 
Prabhu said India has decided to allow private producers to sell power direct 
to consumers, lifting curbs that have hobbled the country's decade-old reform 
effort. 
He said the question of power affordability had spurred him to ask India's 
states to permit third-party sales of power, which analysts have called a 
stumbling-block for foreign investment. 
"They cannot force a generator to sell power only to the SEBs, and that's a 
major change we are trying to make," Prabhu said, referring to the states. 
SEBs or state electricity boards are owned by the state governments, and 
supply power to most of India. 
India estimates that 100,000 MW of fresh capacity will have to be installed 
over the next 12 years to meet its power needs. Most of the $200 billion in 
funds that will be required will have to come from foreign private 
investment. 
But India's spotty reform record over the last decade has made investors 
wary. Bureaucratic procedures, legal delays and political wrangling have held 
up reform moves. 
RATING REVISED TO NEGATIVE 
Last week global rating agency Fitch revised India's sovereign rating outlook 
to negative from stable, citing fiscal concerns, the slow pace of 
privatisation and deterioration in the country's foreign investment climate. 
Competing agency Moody's sees signs of slippage in the reforms, and Standard 
& Poor's has expressed worries over India's budget deficit. 
Prabhu said he wants to overhaul state power utilities by introducing 
standard accounting policies, cutting transmission and distribution losses to 
15 percent, and tackling crushing debt, thus helping to lure foreign 
investment into the sector. 
The poor financial health of the utilities, expected to run up combined 
losses of about $6 billion in the 2001/02 fiscal year, has proved a hurdle in 
efforts to draw private investment. 
Prabhu said an expert panel examining ways to restructure SEB finances - 
looking at technical, commercial and tariff issues - is expected to report 
within a few weeks. 
"For the first time we will be preparing commercial data which is 
internationally accepted. We will be preparing technical data which is 
internationally appreciable. And thirdly, we'll be creating an information 
base which will be created by experts and then made available to the states," 
he said. 
The utilities' transmission and distribution losses run to up to 25 percent 
of the electricity they generate, compared to a figure of about eight percent 
internationally, he said. 
Prabhu wants to trim this to about 15 percent within two or three years. 
"In the case of India, I am willing to accept a figure of 14 percent to 15 
percent, because to bring it below that will be technically feasible but 
commercially unviable," he added. 
Other steps to tone up power generation include attempts to link the eastern 
region with the rest of India, efforts to boost plant load factors through 
modernisation of equipment, and to persuade people to use energy more 
efficiently. 
Prabhu said he is building political will to support these moves through a 
programme to tell consumers why they can no longer get power cheap, or even 
free, as many did in the past. ($1=47 Indian rupees).

Nigerian president slams US energy firm Enron for "poor performance"

06/04/2001
BBC Monitoring
Source: The Guardian web site, Lagos, in English 4 Jun 01/BBC Monitoring/(c) 
BBC

Text of article by Francis Obinor entitled: "Obasanjo chides Enron on Lagos 
power project"; published by Nigerian newspaper The Guardian web site on 4 
June 
For failing to live up to expectation of the Nigerian government and the 
people as regard its role in the Independent Power Project (IPP) initiated by 
the Lagos State government two years ago, Enron, the American firm got a hard 
knock from President Olusegun Obasanjo at the weekend [2-3 June].
In his conclusion, Obasanjo accused Enron, a major player in the electricity 
project, of poor performance and bad faith. Ostensibly angry at the delay in 
the project's full take-off and the 30 MW recently connected to the national 
grid from the scheme, the president on the American Cable News Network (CNN) 
declared: "Enron has played a dirty game on us. Dirty game in two ways." 
Beside putting up an exorbitant price, the company according to the 
president, also failed to comply with the terms of the contract. Continuing, 
Obasanjo said: "The price at which they (Enron) have tried to sell power to 
us has been very exorbitant. Two, what they told us they would do, they have 
not done." 
While refusing to disclose the firm's charges, Enron Vice-President of 
Marketing John Ambler said the primary objective of the company was to get 
the project on stream. "We have a project that is very close to coming on 
line," he said, stressing that the company's desire is to see the project 
work effectively in Nigeria, especially in Lagos. He added that Enron is 
committed to the IPP and assured Lagosians that they would soon begin to feel 
the impact. 
The state government brought forward the June 2001 deadline it set for the 
commencement of the first phase of the project when it fired the first 30 MW 
of electricity to the national grid two weeks ago. 
At the Government House on 23 May, Governor Bola Tinubu said his 
administration and the contracting firm felt that there was no harm in 
bringing the date forward and assured that another 30 MW would be added soon. 
He noted that, contrary to expectations that the project would cover the 
entire state at a go, it would be in phases and the focus for now would be 
industrial consumption. "The concentration for now is not as private homes, 
we would soon get there," Tinubu assured. 
The controversial IPP programme, which the federal government had at one time 
been accused of frustrating, has suffered several setbacks, including Enron's 
initial plan to sell its shares to AES, another American company. Last April 
was originally fixed for the project's take-off but the failure of Trevi, a 
construction company in charge of transmitters, caused a shift in the date.

India: India and Bush Administration: Beyond assumptions

06/04/2001

Asia Intelligence Wire

SOON after Mr George W. Bush Jr. won the US elections, Indian observers 
proclaimed quickly that a Republican administration bodes good for India. A 
Republican administration was expected to not pester India about human rights 
violations in Kashmir, not force it to sign the CTBT, and get tougher with 
China. 
Mr George Bush's decision to "drop by" the External Affairs Minister, Mr 
Jaswant Singh's meeting with the American National Security Advisor, Ms 
Condoleezza Rice, seemed to somehow confirm this false sense of euphoria. 
This narrow thinking fails to understand the drivers of Republican ideology. 
The reality is the Republicans care about a range of issues that will force 
the BJP Government to make some difficult decisions.
Take the first issue of human rights violations in Kashmir. It is true there 
are many isolationists in the Republican Party who, probably, do not care 
about human rights violation in Kashmir so long as it does not affect them, 
and is not happening in their backyard. But there is another powerful force 
in Republican politics - the religious wing. This includes powerful members 
of the US Cabinet such as The Attorney-General, Mr John Ashcroft, who are 
Christian fundamentalists. 
Mr Bush himself claims to be a 'born again Christian'. 
The religious right is rarely interested in foreign policy; it mostly 
concerns itself with moral and social issues such as abortion and teenage 
pregnancy. But the few times it does intervene, it is when it feels a country 
is "persecuting Christians". And when it does intervene, no Republican 
administration dares cross it. 
For instance, China is periodically identified as a country that persecutes 
Christians. Christian missionaries and ministers are routinely harassed and 
imprisoned because they are trying to spread their religion. Because of this 
issue, Republican members of the Christian right in Congress have all but 
declared a religious war on China, routinely opposing any attempt to improve 
relations - including trade relations - with that country. 
India, as an emerging power, is more carefully watched, and frequently 
mentioned in the American press. Stories of Christian missionaries being 
burnt alive and nuns raped are attributed to "elements associated with the 
Hindu fundamentalist ruling party". In its latest human rights report, the US 
State Department noted these acts with concern. 
The Pope's mention of these issues to the Prime Minister, Mr Atal Bihari 
Vajpayee, was also noted in the American press. India is, perhaps, half a 
step away from being branded as a country that "persecutes Christians". 
A self-professed born-again Christian like Mr George Bush would quickly take 
up the Christian right's cause, trumping all other bilateral issues. Human 
rights may not matter to the isolationists, but Christian, and to a lesser 
extent Jewish, religious freedom matters tremendously to a Republican 
administration. 
The second fallacy was that since the Republicans in Congress did not pass 
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, they would not force other countries to 
pass the CTBT either. But why are the Republicans are opposed to the CTBT. 
The opponents of the CTBT feel that it fails to safeguard American security. 
They frankly care little about Indian security. They would love to be able to 
restrict India's ability to test and use its weapons. To them, nuclear 
weapons not in American hands translates into an unsafe world. Unless India 
manages to convince the Republicans otherwise, the Republican administration 
is likely to tighten the anti-proliferation screws on India. 
The third fallacy relates to a tough, long-term strategic re-alignment the 
Bush Administration will demand of India. Mr Bush's foreign policy-makers are 
unreconstructed 'Cold Warriors'. In the post-Cold War era, they are 
desperately "searching for an enemy". They appear to have settled on China as 
"the next enemy". Their next step is to search for "allies" 
who rarely challenge their views. Thinkers in Washington and New Delhi 
believe that India and the US are "natural allies". But such a decision has 
an enormous range of long-term consequences for India. 
To discuss just a few: Most of the Indian military's equipment comes from 
Russia and the former Soviet Union. Allying with the US will be seen by the 
Russians as abandoning them, and this could have an enormous impact on the 
legacy military equipment. Recent noises from the Foreign Ministry suggest 
India is also eager about Mr George Bush's proposed missile defence 
programme. But this technology is far from proven, and during the decade over 
which it may be developed (if it gets past Congress), China will most 
certainly develop many nuclear weapons. These may, primarily, be a deterrent 
against the US, but it will force India into an arms buildup it can barely 
afford. 
The Americans are reserving their missile defence system for their "closest 
allies". India today is neither fish nor fowl - not quite a threat, but not 
quite an ally either. It is unlikely that India will be able to convince the 
Americans to give it the defence system. 
Even if the Americans agree to sell it to India, it could never afford the 
sticker price. So, before it rejoices at the notion of anti-China hawks in 
the White House, let India ponder over the unexamined consequences. 
The final issue is one that may precipitate in the very near term. 
Enron and Maharashtra find themselves in a dispute that neither wants to 
lose, and that appears to be rapidly getting shriller. Mr George Bush's 
background is as a Texas oilman - and he is widely accused in the US of being 
beholden to the interests of the energy industry. 
In fact, they were among the biggest "contributors to his campaign". 
The Enron Chairman, Mr Kenneth Lay, is a friend of Mr Bush's, and was 
seriously considered for a job in his Cabinet. He is so well connected that 
he was recently accused of influencing who is appointed by the White House to 
regulate the energy industry. In the near term, Mr Bush could quite possibly 
lean heavily on New Delhi to "make sure that Enron's interests are not 
neglected". If New Delhi does not respond to his satisfaction, his opinion of 
India, and consequently, his administration's dealings with the country, are 
likely to be coloured far more than we think.

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project

Enron's Indian Creditors Seek to Salvage Dabhol Project

     Mumbai, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Indian banks that loaned money
to Dabhol Power Corp., the local unit of Enron Corp., will try and
persuade their international counterparts to keep alive the $3
billion project at a meeting of lenders in Singapore tomorrow.
    The two-day meeting will be the first between the two groups
of bankers since they met in London on April 24-25 to discuss an
escalating dispute on power prices that has pitted Enron against
the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, Dabhol's only customer.
     ``We will discuss how we can go about resolving the
problem,'' R.S. Agarwal, executive director at Industrial
Development Bank of India, or IDBI, said. IDBI is the biggest
lender to the Dabhol project.
     The outcome of the Singapore meeting, to be held in the
offices of ABN Amro Holding NV, one of the biggest international
lenders to the project, will be crucial to the banks, which have
loaned as much as $2 billion to Dabhol.
     Indian banks fear the Maharashtra State Electricity Board's
decision to stop buying power from Dabhol may strengthen
international lenders' resolve to terminate the project and invoke
government guarantees to recover their loans.
     ``Foreign lenders want to close the (Dabhol) chapter,'' said
Pradyumna Kaul, an activist with Enron Virodhi Andolan, a non-
government organization opposed to the project. ``They are eager
to call in their loans, even if it means taking a 10 to 15 percent
cut, rather than spend more on supervision and legal expenses
while watching the saga linger.''
     Local banks such as IDBI are most at risk as the Maharashtra
and federal governments have guaranteed only foreign banks' loans
of about $600 million to the venture.
     IDBI alone has exposure totaling 21.58 billion rupees ($460
million) to the project, including 15.28 billion rupees in
guarantees.
     Foreign lenders such as ABN Amro, Citibank N.A., a unit of
Citigroup Inc., Bank of America and Credit Suisse First Boston in
April approved Dabhol's decision to begin termination of its power
supply contract with the board. They are in favor of canceling the
project.
     India's government risks having to pay 170 billion rupees in
fines, resulting from guarantees it has offered on payments and
loans, if Enron pulls out of the project.

                             The Fight

     Maharashtra State Electricity Board Wednesday stopped buying
power from Dabhol as the dispute escalated. The board on May 24
told Dabhol Power Co. it was canceling its power purchase
contract, six days after Dabhol gave the board notice it was set
to pull out of the project because of the six-month dispute over
bills owed by the board.
     ``The MSEB's move has complicated the matter. We did not
expect MSEB to do this,'' Agarwal at IDBI said last week.
     Dabhol, 65 percent owned by Enron, and the board are in
dispute over 3 billion rupees in unpaid bills for December and
January. Others bills through March have been paid.
     The board has refused to pay the December and January bills,
saying they should be lowered to reflect a 4 billion rupee penalty
the board imposed on Dabhol for not supplying power at full
capacity on Jan. 28.
     The dispute Thursday prompted debt-rating company Fitch to
change its outlook on India to ``negative'' from ``stable.'' Fitch
said the climate for foreign investors has deteriorated.
     ``The dispute indicates that India's government may not be
willing to live up to its contractual obligation,'' the Economic
Times quoted Kristin Lindow, India analyst at Moody's Investors
Service, as saying. ``As a consequence, this would further deter
foreign director investment from coming into the country.''
     Moody's and Standard & Poor's have stable outlooks on the
country's sovereign rating. S&P has an investment grade rating of
``BBB'' on the country's sovereign debt. Moody's, like Fitch,
rates India's debt as junk at ``BB2.''



Enron Japan's Hirl on Power Deregulation: Commodity Comment
2001-06-04 06:29 (New York)


     Sydney, June 4 (Bloomberg) -- Joseph Hirl, chief executive of
Enron Corp.'s Japanese unit, Enron Japan Corp., comments on the
outlook for deregulation of Japan's electricity industry. He spoke
at the Coaltrans Asia conference in Sydney.

On Japanese government policy:
     ``The government does have a strong commitment to
deregulation, but there are some significant policy concerns''
including a ``greater than 80 percent reliance on imports'' of
energy.
     ``The market has been open a bit over a year, however not
much has happened. No genuine competition exists under the current
system. The companies there recognize that it will happen. It's
inevitable.
     ``The level of competition in Japan now is similar to the
U.S. in 1994-95, or Europe in 1996-97. Prices are about 400
percent higher than the U.S.
     ``To put it in perspective, I won't give the name of this
large chemical company, but it consumes about 600 megawatts. If
you compare that business with a company that's just like it in
Houston, Texas, the difference would be about $250 million a year
in the cost of electricity.
     ``For such an export-led economy, that's a difficult
situation to be in, and it's contributing to the overall malaise
in the economy.''

On the likelihood of a California-style electricity crisis in
Japan:
     ``Despite exploitation of California by the utilities, METI
(Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry) and others recognize it
was a problem of design, not competition'' in California.

A Texas business executive whose company has profited enormously from 
California's energy crisis says California needs more deregulation, not less. 
Kenneth Lay, the head of Houston-based Enron Corp., handed out a four-page 
plan detailing his solution to California's energy crisis at a meeting with 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and other state business and political 
leaders at a Beverly Hills hotel May 17.
The report details several ways to solve California's energy crisis. 
"Get deregulation right in California," it reads. "California never 
deregulated. . . . There is more regulation than ever." 
Among the document's other points are calls for consumers to pay the billions 
of dollars in debt the state's public utilities have incurred, and an 
assertion that federal investigations into price gouging by private firms 
such as Enron are contributing to the problems. 
Lay also suggests increasing conservation efforts, partly through pricing 
that would cost consumers more for using electricity during peak times. 
Reached for comment, Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, called 
the paper a "generator's wish list," saying it goes against the governor's 
policy on the energy crisis. 
"The governor is not calling off the dogs," Maviglio said Saturday. "To 
suggest that ratepayers should shoulder the entire burden of deregulation is 
totally the opposite of what the governor is calling for." 
Lay, one of President Bush's biggest campaign contributors and a key advisor 
on the Bush energy plan, has built a powerful energy company by buying 
electricity from generators and then selling it. Enron reported first-quarter 
revenue of $50.1 billion, nearly a 281% increase over the same quarter last 
year. 
Lay met with Riordan and luminaries including actor Arnold Schwarzenegger and 
financier Michael Milken--plus about a dozen others--at the Peninsula Hotel. 
Enron spokesman Mark Palmer said: "Our position is simple." California needs 
to "increase the supply of energy and decrease the demand."

Cutting Kilowatt Hours / Californians see rewards in conservation

For months, Californians have been engaging in acts so egregious that Beltway 
types fear they threaten "the American way" of life. 
Like conserving energy. In huge numbers.
The Bush administration has been fretting about how to protect our way of 
life in the face of energy shortages, but many Californians will tell you 
they haven't sacrificed much of anything while knocking 20 percent or more 
off their power bill. Not unless you count having two refrigerators to be a 
constitutionally protected right. 
"People who complain about the cost of energy just aren't thinking hard 
enough for ways to save," said Jerri Linn Phillips. She cut 30 percent from 
her power bill by unplugging unused appliances in her one-bedroom apartment 
in San Francisco's Japantown. 
To the amazement of the rest of the energy-guzzling country, all this 
personal sacrifice hasn't curled the stereotypically soft Californians into 
fetal positions. In fact, with electricity costs about to go up, many are 
ready to evangelize about their relatively pain-free conservation. 
"The real hardship has been the fear of the unknown," said P.J. Astrup, an 
Alameda resident whose most recent cross to bear was finding a gallon of 
curdled milk in his second refrigerator. 
"Sure, the lights going out for a couple of hours may have perturbed a few 
people (in California), but it hasn't been that bad yet." 
That doesn't mean conserving has been easy. It's been a hassle to change 
bulbs and air-dry clothes and nag the kids: "Turn off those lights. Don't you 
know there's an energy crisis?" 
Still, a Field Poll this month found that 63 percent of Californians surveyed 
have cut at least 10 percent of their energy usage since the start of the 
crisis; nearly one in four has cut 20 percent or more. The poll was taken 
after a study found that Californians use less electricity than their 
counterparts in every state but one -- Rhode Island. 
Not every California conservationist is as rabid as John Muir. While the more 
ambitious bought meter readers to measure the output of every appliance in 
the house, the rest just unplugged their coffeemakers and let the laundry 
pile up an extra week until there was a full load. 
A few, like Rosie Sorenson, make a game of con 
serving. 
When the Richmond resident feels like rewarding herself for a conservation 
job well done, she'll say, "Tonight, I'll treat myself - - I'll read with 
real electricity," instead of using a battery- powered lamp. 
Or she'll plug in two, count 'em, two bulbs in the panel above the bathroom 
mirror in her 1,150-square-foot condominium. 
"We're very privileged as a country," said the self-described "recovering 
psychotherapist" and budding novelist. "We have so much. But if we rally 
together, we should be able to get through this." 
Flipping circuit breakers, air-drying clothes and performing a dozen other 
conservation tasks has helped Sorenson drop her electricity usage 41 percent 
from January to March. Next up: She's going to ask the head of her condo 
complex to turn down the heat in one of its three pools and -- horrors! -- 
hot tubs. "We don't need all that," Sorenson said. 
Conservation chutzpah like that could be construed as compromising the 
American way of living in another part of the country. Middle America hears 
"conservation" and thinks, "Put some canned peaches in the root cellar. We 
got another Depression coming." 
A better term would be "energy efficient," said Richard Perez, editor of the 
14-year-old magazine Home Power, a bible for folks living off the power grid. 
While "conservation" connotes "doing without" to the unconverted, everybody 
feels good about making their lives more "efficient." 
"I come from a no-sacrifice kind of place," said Perez, who hasn't turned off 
his microwave, VCR or any other appliance, even though his Ashland, Ore., 
home is powered exclusively by renewable energy sources. "And we haven't met 
a California home yet where we can't cut the utility costs 20 percent." 
Conservation is a fun game the whole family can play. Jeff Goodrich deputized 
his three children as "energy monitors" at the beginning of the energy 
crisis. Their reward for closing doors and turning off the TV surge 
protector: Every month, they get to keep whatever the family saved over last 
year's energy bill. Last month, each kid got $22. 
"I'd rather give the money to them than Enron or some Texas company," said 
Goodrich, who lives in Greenbrae. 
"I'm always amazed by the response people have to Californians," he said. "It 
seems like they're always ready to jump on us for being nuts. But 
conservation is about preserving our standard of living, not doing without."

LOS ANGELES - Welcome to California, Mr. President. You're a brave man. 
They've been saying terrible things about you out here. Some of them are even 
true. 
When you arrive Monday for your first visit to the Golden State since the 
election, try to blend in. Take it from me, you'd look fabulous in 
Birkenstocks. Don't call it "La-La-Land." But do say, "dude," a lot. (See 
below.)
Remember these people didn't like you that much before the lights began to 
flicker. Key figures: Gore 54, Bush 41. And after all that work and money and 
those nasty, hot visits last year to the raisin sheds in Fresno. So, don't 
take the smiles of the official welcoming party too seriously. They wouldn't 
make a very good focus group. 
When I told John Burton, Democratic leader of the state Senate, you were 
finally coming to California he said: "It'll be like Stevenson going to 
Dallas." Not exactly, but you get the idea. 
You can do self-deprecation, and it would not be amiss. Self- deprecation, 
hell. What about self-mortification? You might even want to borrow Jerry 
Brown's little flagellation thingy from his seminary days. 
Did you bring a flashlight? 
It would help if you can tone down the West Texas twang. Intimate that you're 
an orphan, and certainly don't admit that your parents live in Houston or 
that you've ever been to such a wantonly rapacious place. Why, 
"unconscionable price-gouging" occurs there, according to Gov. Gray Davis. 
Talk about your brother in Florida and how, just like Californians, he 
doesn't want any more drilling off his coastline. (You can skip the part 
about how you don't exactly agree - with him or them.) 
Talk about your sister in the Washington, D.C.-area. Remind them that her 
husband worked for such California Democrats as Tony Coelho (do not recall 
that Coelho got out of Congress just ahead of the ethics committee) and that 
your brother-in-law is a lobbyist for the California wine industry. Good 
names to drop: Ernest and Julio. 
You might try telling folks you're from Connecticut. You were born there, and 
you went back to Yale as commencement speaker just last Monday. 
And for heaven's sake don't tell them you know Enron Chairman Ken Lay or that 
he and corporate colleagues are among the biggest Republican bankrollers. A 
few days ago, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he'd like to find a 
way to lodge criminal charges against some Big Energy boys. 
"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8 x 10 cell that he could share 
with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer told 
one crowd, according to an aide. Just for emphasis, the attorney general 
repeated it for the Wall Street Journal. I guess Lockyer just forgot to 
mention that as a state senator in 1996 he voted for the electricity 
deregulation bill at the heart of the problem. 
See, I told you how useful "dude" could be. And, as Lockyer also proves, 
cheap political theatrics are pretty hot too. 
Before you meet with Gov. Davis, make sure to read the latest statewide poll 
from the Public Policy Institute of California. Maybe have it lying around 
the room when Davis walks in. He's familiar with the numbers and will catch 
your drift. 
Fewer than half of Californians now approve of the way he's handling his job 
- a big drop from January. Sixty percent disapprove of the way he's handling 
the electricity crisis. 
The best news is that the public doesn't really blame either of you - yet - 
for the crisis. A third of folks in the poll blame the energy companies. 
Almost as many blame former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson who pushed the 
deregulation measure and the Democratic- dominated Legislature that enacted 
it. 
Only 10 percent blame Davis and the current Legislature and only 8 percent 
blame you and the federal government - the same number, by the way, who blame 
California consumers. But that doesn't mean you're off the hook. Fifty-six 
percent of the folks don't like the way you're responding to the crisis. If 
you don't have an order for capping electricity prices in your briefcase, you 
might consider having Air Force One fly on to Hawaii. 
Like folks across the country, Californians give you decent marks overall, 
with 57 percent in the PPIC poll approving of your job performance and 36 
percent disapproving. Seven percent must have been at the beach. 
Two other things: Get out of here before the air-conditioning season really 
cranks up, and, remember, they call it "sushi," not "bait."

BUSINESS
Houston's top execs in energy / Oil and gas claims 8 of 10 highest- paid
L.M. SIXEL

Want to know just how well the energy business is doing? 
Consider this: Eight out of the 10 highest-paid executives in Houston are in 
the oil and gas business.
The annual list, compiled by Resource Connection for the Houston Chronicle, 
is dominated by executives from Enron Corp., Anadarko Petroleum Corp. and 
Nabors Industries. The executives were handsomely rewarded in stock options 
and awards of stock at a time when their company stock prices are riding 
high. 
The top earner was the chairman and CEO of Nabors Industries, Eugene M. 
Isenberg. He earned $63.9 million last year, largely because the company 
doubled the number of options it awarded him the previous year, said Tammy 
Hemphill, director of human capital consulting for Resource Connection. 
When times are good, companies typically give away more options. It's a way 
to attract and retain senior management. 
Isenberg's compensation comes strictly through the performance of the 
company, said Denny Smith, director of corporate development for Nabors 
Industries. The only way Isenberg can make money is if the value of the 
company's stock grows through his efforts. 
And he's made a lot for Nabors Industries. When Isenberg took over the 
company in 1986, its net worth was a negative $35 million and it was emerging 
from bankruptcy. Under Isenberg's leadership, the company's net worth is now 
$2 billion, said Smith. And Nabors' stock price doubled during 2000. 
Isenberg earned 42 percent more than the highest-paid executive of the year 
before. Robert Devlin, American General's chairman and chief executive 
officer, earned $45 million in 1999. 
Devlin fell to the 10th place on the recent list (he earned $27,272,697 in 
2000). But according to a source familiar with American General's 
compensation packages, Devlin will receive about $200 million in stock 
options and other incentives in 2001 as a result of American International 
Group's purchase of American General. 
Four of the six highest-paid executives in Houston are from Enron. But the 
highest-paid Enron executive is not Chairman Ken Lay. 
In fact, Lay made less money than three of his lieutenants because he 
received far fewer stock options. 
For example, Kenneth Rice, chairman and chief executive officer of Enron 
Broadband Services, one of Enron's business units, received more than twice 
as many options as Lay and Jeff Skilling, Enron's chief executive officer and 
president. 
Consequently, Rice was the second-highest-paid executive in Houston, taking 
home $47,375,588 in 2000. Lay, who was the sixth- highest-paid executive, 
earned $35,665,037. 
Max Watson, the former chairman and chief executive officer of BMC Software, 
was conspicuously absent from the list this year. 
He didn't get any stock options or restricted stock awards in 2000, so his 
compensation was just salary and bonus of $1.2 million, Hemphill said. But 
that wasn't enough to put him on the list, which required a package worth at 
least $2 million. 
John Cox, acting chief financial officer of BMC Software, said the company 
awards options only once every three years. It's a good- sized grant that's 
supposed to last three years. 
The options take four years to vest so they always have options "on the 
table" - options that haven't vested yet but have a high value that makes it 
difficult for an executive to leave the company. 
Of the 17 highest-paid executives in Houston, five are from Anadarko. 
"They're very good at what they do," said Teresa Wong, manager of public 
affairs and corporate communications for Anadarko. 
The company went from a $4 billion company in January 2000 to a $16 billion 
company by the end of the year, she said. It catapulted into the top in terms 
of production, employees and reserves, she said. 
The executives are being rewarded for that increased risk and responsibility, 
she said. And it didn't hurt that the stock price more than doubled during 
the year. 
Dynegy's executives also benefited from the company's rapid growth. Two of 
the merchant energy company executives were among the 14 highest-paid 
executives in Houston. 
"We had an incredible year last year," said Jennifer Rosser, director of 
strategic business communications. The stock price increased 231 percent, the 
number of employees more than doubled, and the company had a 210 percent 
increase in net income. 
Chuck Watson, chairman and CEO, and Steve Bergstrom, the company's president, 
are among the founders of the company, she said. 
Incentive plans based on options and awards of stock work well when the stock 
market is riding high. They aren't as effective when the stock prices are 
"underwater" - Wall Street lingo for worthless. 
So, to re-motivate executives in a depressed stock market, nonenergy 
companies have been focusing on short-term incentives such as cash bonuses, 
said Wes Hart, an executive compensation consultant who designs executive 
incentive plans for Buck Consultants. 
Companies hope the cash incentives will boost their numbers - earnings per 
share and cash flow - and hopefully the stock price will follow, Hart said. 
That new focus on short-term thinking doesn't mean companies stopped 
pondering longer-term goals. But some are adding more "teeth" to their 
long-term performance goals to get away from the idea that options are a 
"gimme" or given based on seniority. 
And to keep the long-term goals from becoming worthless when the stock price 
falls, companies are using goals that aren't as directly tied to the stock 
price. 
Sometimes executives must meet a profit hurdle. Others must outperform a 
designated peer group on several key performance categories, Hart said. 
Other times, executives are required to meet an imposed stock market hurdle; 
for example, the stock has to reach $50 and stay there for 10 days. And some 
companies are giving executives a reward if the company's stock price drops 
less than its competitors, Hart said.

Enron's Indian Unit Dabhol Rejects Payment From State in Quarrel Over Bills
By Jesse Pesta

05/27/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Staff Reporter at The Asian Wall Street Journal 
NEW DELHI -- In an unusual twist in a quarrel over unpaid bills, Enron 
Corp.'s Indian power project, Dabhol Power Corp., has rejected a check valued 
at $39 million from its only customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board.
Dabhol also delivered a sharply worded four-page letter responding to the 
electricity board's decision last week to rescind its contract based on a 
claim that Dabhol misrepresented its "ramp-up rate" - the time it takes to go 
from launch to full power. "We deny that DPC have practiced any 
misrepresentation," the letter says. "Furthermore, we do not think that the 
MSEB entertains any honest belief" in its own allegation, the letter says. 
It is the latest in a series of counterpunches as both sides try to gain the 
edge in a fight over the rates Dabhol charges for electricity. The $3 billion 
power plant is the largest foreign investment in India, and the dispute is 
being closely watched as an indicator of India's hospitality toward investors 
from abroad. 
India is in dire need of electricity: New Delhi endures hours-long blackouts 
every day. However, many of India's state electricity boards have little cash 
because of widespread electricity theft and lax customer metering. The Dabhol 
dispute broke late last year, when the Maharashtra board defaulted on bills 
totaling $48 million. 
Dabhol's critics claim the rates it charges are unreasonably high. Dabhol 
rejects that argument. Among other things, Dabhol has pointed out that the 
Maharashtra board draws only about 15% of the plant's capacity, down from an 
average of 60% or so before the dispute. Reduced use pushes up the per-unit 
cost because the pricing formula includes some capital costs. A 90% 
utilization rate would result in a tariff of 4.5 to five rupees (nine cents 
to 11 cents) per kilowatt-hour, one official estimated. In contrast, the 
chairman of the Maharashtra electricity board, Vinay Bansal, said on Sunday 
that current tariffs may be in the range of seven to 10 rupees, which he 
acknowledged is partly due to reduced utilization of capacity. 
Mr. Bansal said he hadn't seen the Dabhol letter and couldn't comment on it 
specifically. 
He also said that after Dabhol rejected the April payment, the Maharashtra 
board deposited the payment to a Dabhol account. But, he added, "If they want 
to return it, they can still return it." 
In the letter, Dabhol says it rejected the check for 1.37 billion rupees 
because it was accompanied by a note saying the payment was made under 
protest, a reference to the Maharashtra board's decision last week to rescind 
its electricity contract with Dabhol. 
"The MSEB cannot have it both ways," says the letter, signed by Enron 
executive K. Wade Cline. Either the board is rescinding the contract, or it 
is affirming the validity of the contract by making payments. 
Regarding the Maharashtra board's claim that Dabhol misrepresented the 
plant's ramp-up rate, the letter says the contract permits "unilateral 
amendment" of the production schedule based on actual plant performance. Mr. 
Bansal said the board disagrees with Dabhol's interpretation of the contract. 
This isn't the first time Dabhol has come under fire. In Maharashtra state 
elections in 1995, a coalition government came to power partly on the 
strength of a campaign against the plant. Political leaders said the plan was 
too costly and too dependent on foreign fuel. The newly elected state 
government canceled the project, although the contract was later renegotiated 
and construction was finished in May 1999. 
With the payment defaults, trouble had returned. In recent months, Dabhol has 
invoked political force majeure - a move typically used to dissolve a 
contract because of war or natural disaster - saying recent government 
actions could harm the company's ability to meet its obligations. It also has 
called on existing federal-government guarantees to cover the overdue bills. 
Meanwhile, the Maharashtra electricity board has slapped fines totaling four 
billion rupees ($85 million) on Dabhol for amending the start-up schedule, 
and a state panel has recommended sweeping changes in the contract. 
But the past week or so has been particularly stormy and Dabhol itself 
indicated a willingness to scrap the contract. A week ago, Dabhol issued a 
preliminary termination notice, a formal step that would allow it to cancel 
the contract six months from now if the disputes aren't resolved. And on 
Wednesday, the Maharashtra board said it was rescinding the contract.

SAUDI ARABIA: UPDATE 3-Saudi seen revealing gas leaders before June signing.
By Peg Mackey

05/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

DUBAI, May 27 (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia is expected to reveal the leaders of 
two coveted gas projects before putting pen to paper on multi-billion dollar 
agreements with leading foreign oil companies on June 3, industry sources 
said on Sunday. 
On May 18 the kingdom awarded eight major oil companies stakes in a gas 
development initiative, its biggest opening to foreign investors in a quarter 
of a century.
ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell have won starring roles in the so-called 
"core venture" projects, estimated to require combined total investments of 
$25 billion. 
And industry sources have suggested that Exxon is in pole position to lead 
the $15 billion South Ghawar development, known as core venture 1, with Shell 
a strong contender to lead core venture three - development of gas at Shaybah 
in the empty quarter of southeast Saudi Arabia. 
Both supermajors already have considerable investment in the kingdom's 
refining and petrochemical sectors and feature as top customers of Saudi oil. 
BP is also competing for the top slot in South Ghawar, sources said. 
Exxon, Shell, BP and Phillips have all been granted stakes in South Ghawar, 
viewed by many as the prize gem of the gas initiative - unveiled more than 
two years ago. 
The leader of core venture 1 is due to get a 35 percent stake, two companies 
are to get 25 percent each and one firm 15 percent, sources in the region 
said. 
Shell, TotalFinaElf and Conoco have all been awarded stakes in the Shaybah 
venture, where the leading company is due to receive a 40 percent stake, with 
the remaining firms getting 30 percent each, according to industry sources. 
Exxon already has secured the leading role with 70 percent in core venture 
two on the Red Sea coast while Occidental and Enron between them hold 30 
percent. 
READING THE FINE PRINT 
By the signing ceremony in Jeddah, the oil companies will have had more than 
two weeks to pore over "preparatory agreements" which detail some guidelines 
for the three core ventures and outline the percentage stakes of each 
consortium, industry sources said. 
Fiscal and regulatory frameworks are to be worked out during the second half 
of the year, they added. 
Companies are expecting tough negotiations in order to finalise contracts by 
a year-end target. "This is just the start of things," an industry executive 
said. "There are going to be about five months of intense talks." 
Top oil firms insist there are profits to be made in the kingdom, holder of 
the world's fourth-biggest gas reserves. 
"The Saudis have been saying all along that these are world-class projects 
with world-class returns," an analyst said. "The oil majors are not doubting 
that." 
And they have wound up with bigger exploration blocks than they first 
envisaged. "They all asked for more exploration and they got it," an industry 
executive said. 
The scope of South Ghawar core venture 1 includes gas exploration in the 
North Rub al Khali, a natural gas liquids (NGL) recovery plant, gas 
processing, participation in expansion of the gas pipeline network, 
construction of two power and water desalination plants and two petrochemical 
plants. 
Investment of up to $5 billion in the Red Sea core venture 2 includes an 
exploration area in the northern Red Sea, development of the existing Midyan 
and Barqan gas fields and requirements for power, desalination and 
petrochemical plants. 
Investment of some $5 billion in the Shaybah core venture 3, Shaybah includes 
gas exploration in South Rub al Khali, development of the Kidan gas field and 
power, desalination and petrochemical plants. 
Analysts expect state oil company Saudi Aramco to participate in the gas 
initiative. "It is unwise to think that Saudi Aramco will not be involved," a 
regional analyst said.

Oil Cos Told To Accept Aramco As Gas JV Partner -Report

05/27/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

MANAMA, Bahrain -(Dow Jones)- The Saudi government has told international oil 
companies they must accept the state-owned Saudi Arabian Oil Co. (C.SOI), or 
Aramco, as a partner in any core gas project it offers them if Aramco wants 
the partnership, the Saudi business daily al-Eqtisadiah reported Sunday. 
It quoted sources as saying that Aramco will also have a majority voting 
rights on key issues regardless of its equity size in the projects. The 
newspaper didn't elaborate on whether this kind of arrangement would be 
accepted by the foreign companies.
Aramco would also receive compensation for any existing assets, property or 
infrastructure used by the planned joint ventures, which shouldn't conflict 
with any of Aramco's current projects, the newspaper said. 
The Saudi government is expected to sign preliminary agreements for 
multibillion dollar natural gas development projects with prequalified oil 
companies June 3, a Saudi government source said Sunday. 
The government earlier this month selected a consortium comprising Exxon 
Mobil Corp. (XOM), Royal Dutch/Shell Group (RD), BP PLC (BP) and Phillips 
Petroleum Co. (P), for a project to develop the South Ghawar field, called 
Core Venture 1, with an estimated investment value of between $15 billion and 
$17 billion. 
Exxon Mobil was also appointed to lead Core Venture 2, or the Red Sea 
project, with Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) and Enron Corp. (ENE), which 
bid jointly for the project, as partners. 
Core Venture 3, the Shaybah project, was awarded to a consortium of Shell, 
TotalFinaElf (TOT) and Conoco Inc. (COCA). Leaders for Core Ventures 1 and 3 
have yet to be confirmed.

India: Indian lenders of DPC to participate in Singapore meet

05/27/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)
Copyright (C) 2001 Kasturi & Sons Ltd (KSL); Source: World Reporter (TM) - 
Asia Intelligence Wire

MUMBAI, May 26. INDIAN lenders to Dabhol Power Company have decided to take 
part at the meeting in Singapore called by foreign financiers of the project. 
Institutional sources told Business Line that even though the exact agenda of 
the meeting has not been finalised as yet, domestic lenders would participate 
in the meeting to be held on June 5 and 6. They were earlier contemplating 
skipping the meeting as they thought it would serve no good because DPC had 
anyway begun termination proceedings.
Also, with chances of foreign lenders cashing the deferred payment guarantees 
increasing, Indian lenders are keen to find out what is on their minds. As of 
now, they have not received any indication from their counterparts abroad. 
The source said the meeting is expected to discuss whether they should 
continue disbursements to the project in spite of the company serving the 
preliminary termination notice and MSEB retaliating with a legal notice. The 
board yesterday approached the Electricity regulatory commission for 
resolving the dispute for which a hearing is scheduled on May 29. 
Indian financiers still favour continuing with the project as it is close to 
completion. 
Another issue likely to crop up is funding the cost overruns. The delays 
caused by various reasons has apparently resulted in cost overruns reportedly 
of about $400 million. The company has already brought in all the equity and 
now, if it has to continue with construction, it has to borrow more, which 
the lenders are not very keen on. 
Meanwhile, the sources said Enron is trying to work out ways of bringing down 
the tariff. They said Enron is likely to have another meeting with officials 
of Union Power and Finance Ministries.

Senator Calls for Hearings Into Energy Regulators' Moves
By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS

05/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 11, Column 1
c. 2001 New York Times Company

WASHINGTON, May 25 -- Accusing federal regulators of not doing their job, 
Senator Dianne Feinstein called today for hearings into possible 
improprieties between members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and 
private energy interests. 
Ms. Feinstein, a California Democrat, said the commission, which is 
responsible for regulating the energy industry and is known by the acronym 
FERC, had not acted to protect residents of her state from companies that 
were reaping undue profits through spiraling energy costs.
''Despite evidence of manipulation and price gouging in both the electricity 
and natural gas markets in California and the West, and a finding by FERC 
last November of 'unjust and unreasonable' rates,'' the senator said, ''the 
commission has failed to take the actions necessary to bring reliability and 
stability to the marketplace.'' 
Ms. Feinstein made the request in a letter to Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, 
who is poised to take over the Committee on Governmental Affairs once the 
Democrats regain control of the Senate. Mr. Lieberman, who has already asked 
the General Accounting Office to investigate price gouging, could not be 
reached for comment today. 
In her letter, Ms. Feinstein cited an article in The New York Times today 
reporting that Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of the Enron Corporation, had told 
the commission's chairman, Curtis Hebert Jr., that he would support his 
continuation in the job if the commissioner endorsed the company's views on 
energy deregulation. Enron is the nation's largest electricity trader. 
Mr. Hebert said he had rejected Mr. Lay's offer. Mr. Lay told The Times that 
it was Mr. Hebert who had asked him to intercede with White House officials. 
The president appoints members of the commission and names its chairman. 
''It would be unconscionable if any of the nation's electricity traders or 
generators were in a position to be able to determine who chairs or becomes a 
member of the commission,'' Ms. Feinstein said. 
Environmental groups and other critics say the Bush administration has 
granted unprecedented access to leaders of the energy industry. They note 
that both President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney made their fortunes 
in oil and that the president's national energy strategy, unveiled last week, 
relied heavily on exploiting new resources rather than conservation or fuel 
efficiency. 
But in a recent interview, Mr. Cheney said the White House was motivated by 
''sound public policy'' and not what the energy companies sought. 
The Senate today confirmed Mr. Bush's nominees for two Republican vacancies 
on the five-member panel. They are Patrick Wood, a former head of the Texas 
Public Utilities Commission, which deregulated electricity in the president's 
home state, and Nora Brownwell, a Pennsylvania utility regulator. 
Mr. Cheney has indicated that Mr. Wood will take over as chairman.

Enron's secret bid to save deregulation / PRIVATE MEETING: Chairman pitches 
his plan to prominent Californians
Christian Berthelsen, Scott Winokur
Chronicle Staff Writers

05/26/2001
The San Francisco Chronicle
FINAL
A.1
(Copyright 2001)

Energy executive Kenneth Lay, head of powerful Enron Corp., quietly courted 
Arnold Schwarzenegger, Richard Riordan, Michael Milken and other luminaries 
this week in Beverly Hills to drum up support for his solution to 
California's energy crisis. 
His prescription called for more rate increases, an end to state and federal 
investigations and less rather than more regulation.
Lay, a close friend of President Bush and one of his largest campaign 
contributors, hosted a private 90-minute meeting in a conference room at the 
Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills on Thursday. 
Among the participants were Milken, the former head of the Drexel Burnham 
Lambert investment banking firm who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990 
and who now runs a think tank based in Santa Monica; movie star 
Schwarzenegger; and Riordan, the mayor of Los Angeles. Schwarzenegger and 
Riordan have been courted recently as GOP gubernatorial candidates. 
One participant, who agreed to speak on the condition he not be identified, 
said the meeting appeared to be geared toward getting participants to support 
Lay's vision and then champion it to officials who are trying to solve the 
state's energy mess. 
PLAN TO RESCUE DEREGULATION 
The source said the timing and tone of the meeting suggested Lay is concerned 
that California will abandon its disastrous experiment with power markets by 
either re-regulating the system or creating a government authority to provide 
electricity. Gov. Gray Davis signed legislation last week to create and fund 
a state power authority that would build, buy and run power plants in 
California. 
"They're trying to rescue deregulation," the source said of Enron executives. 
"They think the whole state power authority is a bad idea." 
At the meeting, Enron representatives circulated a four-page position paper 
titled "Comprehensive Solution for California," which was obtained by The 
Chronicle. It said ratepayers should bear responsibility for the billions in 
debt incurred by the state's public utilities and that investigations of 
power price manipulation and political rhetoric are making matters worse. 
The paper made no mention of the possibility that much of the runaway 
electricity costs in California is due to market manipulation by power 
generators and traders -- a possibility given credibility in studies by 
regulators and economists. 
One of the talking points read: "Get deregulation right this time - - 
California needs a real electricity market, not government takeovers." 
Another point suggested giving consumers monetary rebates for conserving 
electricity. 
INVOLVED IN EARLY DAYS 
Lay has been an aggressive champion of deregulated electricity markets and 
was an early advocate in persuading California to begin its experiment with a 
competitive power market system. 
Lay has created a new kind of company in the process, one that essentially 
produces nothing but makes money as a middle-man, buying electricity from 
generators and selling it to consumers. During the first quarter of this 
year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 billion. 
Asked about the purpose of the meeting, Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for Enron, 
said she would "look into that" and then did not return repeated telephone 
calls seeking comment. One participant said Denne was present at the meeting. 
D.C. CONNECTIONS 
Meanwhile, Lay's power in Washington is reported to have reached 
unprecedented heights. According to a story in yesterday's New York Times, 
Lay supplied the Bush administration with a list of candidates for jobs 
regulating the power industry and even interviewed one of them. The story 
also said Lay essentially threatened to seek the removal of the chairman of 
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Curt Hebert, if he does not support 
Lay's desire to further deregulate the nation's electricity system. Lay 
denied the allegation. 
Also in attendance at this week's meeting were Bruce Karatz, chief executive 
of home builder Kaufman & Broad; Ray Irani, chief executive of Occidental 
Petroleum; and Kevin Sharer, chief executive of biotech giant Amgen. Among 
those who were invited but did not attend were former Los Angeles Lakers star 
Earvin "Magic" Johnson; supermarket magnate and Bill Clinton supporter Ron 
Burkle; and Dennis Tito, recently returned from the world's first civilian 
space trip. 
Milken, through a spokesman, confirmed that he attended the meeting, but 
declined to be interviewed. Schwarzenegger could not be reached for comment 
through a publicist, and Sharer did not return a call yesterday afternoon. 
A spokesman for Riordan, Peter Hidalgo, said the Los Angeles mayor attended, 
but was "not intending to formulate any kind of policy position on this 
issue. His intent is to listen to all sides." 
Attached to the Enron handout was a two-page open letter, addressed to Davis 
and the state Legislature, apparently prepared for those who support Lay's 
position and would be willing to sign their names to it. The source who 
participated in the meeting said those assembled appeared noncommittal and 
asked a number of questions of Lay, but did not agree to champion his agenda.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 26 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. chairman Kenneth Lay sought the 
backing of prominent Californians for an energy deregulation plan this week 
but had little success, the San Francisco Chronicle reported on Saturday. 
The newspaper, citing an anonymous source present at the 90-minute meeting 
Thursday at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly Hills, said that among those 
present were Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, actor Arnold Schwarzenegger 
and former junk-bond kind Michael Milken.
The newspaper said Enron failed to obtain signatures from anyone at the 
meeting for an open letter to Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislature which 
was attached to a four-page position paper championing power market 
deregulation. 
The Chronicle quoted its source as saying Lay's guests were inquisitive but 
noncommittal.

Enron courts prominent Californians at secret meeting

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - In a move to garner support from prominent California 
Republicans, a Texas energy executive held a secret meeting to push for the 
preservation of the state's deregulated power market, a newspaper reported 
Saturday. 
Houston-based Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay met with such names as movie 
star Arnold Schwarzenegger, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Michael 
Milken, who pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 1990 as head of the Drexel 
Burnham Lambert investment banking firm, the San Francisco Chronicle 
reported. The 90-minute private meeting took place Thursday in a Beverly 
Hills hotel.
Schwarzenegger and Riordan have been courted as Republican candidates for 
governor. 
Enron distributed a four-page plan at the meeting calling for ratepayers to 
pay the billions in debt racked up by the state's public utilities and 
contending that state and federal investigations of price gouging are 
hindering the situation, the Chronicle reported after obtaining a copy of the 
paper. 
Others attending the meeting included chief executives Ray Irani of 
Occidental Petroleum, Kevin Sharer of biotech giant Amgen, and Bruce Karatz 
of home builder Kaufman & Broad, the Chronicle reported, citing unidentified 
sources. 
Lay, who is a friend and one of President Bush's largest campaign

electricity from generators and selling it to consumers. During the first 
quarter of this year, Enron's revenues increased 281 percent to $50.1 
billion. 
Lay and Gov. Gray Davis have disagreed about how California's power crisis 
should be handled, and Lay says his company is being used as a scapegoat. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne did not immediately return a call seeking 
comment Saturday.

Enron's Dispute With Utility In India Grows More Tangled
By SARITHA RAI

05/26/2001
The New York Times
Page 2, Column 5
c. 2001 New York Times Company

BANGALORE, India, May 25 -- The dispute between the Enron Corporation and 
Indian federal and state government officials keeps getting messier. 
Talks meant to settle the dispute over months of unpaid power bills fell 
apart before they could begin on Wednesday, when the chief negotiator on the 
government side, Madhav Godbole, abruptly resigned after being criticized by 
a senior politician for going into the negotiations with a ''negative 
mind-set.'' Pressure from the chief minister of Maharashtra state persuaded 
him to retract the resignation later in the day.
Then, on Thursday, the state-run utility at the center of the dispute -- the 
sole customer for electricity generated by the Enron-controlled Dabhol Power 
Company -- served notice that it would challenge the validity of the contract 
between Dabhol and the utility and seek to have it canceled. 
The utility has long complained that Dabhol's rates are too high, and it has 
tried to assess penalties on Dabhol for failing to achieve promised levels of 
power capacity. 
Another government committee member, R. K. Pachauri, the director of an 
energy research institute, also resigned, and told reporters that the 
committee had been asked to rewrite the power supply contract, which it had 
no authority to do. 
The move by the utility came nearly a week after Dabhol escalated the dispute 
to a new level by serving its own termination notice on the utility for 
nonpayment. Under the contract's terms, Dabhol's notice set the clock ticking 
on a six-month cooling-off period in which the two sides might settle the 
dispute before the contract is ended. 
The Indian federal government, which is represented on the negotiating 
committee along with the utility and the state government, has been pressing 
for a quick resolution. ''The government is ready to consider any worthwhile 
idea emerging out of the renegotiating committee for the settlement of the 
dispute,'' the energy minister, Suresh Prabhu, said on Thursday. 
Where the talks are headed is hard to tell, but both sides have much to lose 
from an irreparable rupture. The success of the $2.9 billion Dabhol project, 
65 percent owned by Enron, is seen as crucial to the development of India's 
investment-starved power industry, and to India's hopes of attracting $10 
billion in foreign investment in the coming year. Both the federal and state 
governments have guaranteed the utility's payments of its bills, as well as 
some of the loans to build the project. 
For Enron's part, Dabhol has not brought in any revenue for months, and a 
drawn-out legal battle in the Indian courts could leave it unable to recover 
any of its losses if unsuccessful. 
Talks are now scheduled to begin Tuesday.

India: MSEB requests MERC to rescind Dabhol PPA

MUMBAI, May 25. THE Maharashtra State Electricity Board filed a petition with 
the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission on Friday, asking it to 
rescind the power purchase agreement (PPA) with the Dabhol Power Company. 
The move is expected to shift arbitration proceedings between the two 
companies to an Indian forum. "MERC will now give us instructions whether 
parallel action should continue. We are praying to the commission that 
arbitration proceedings be discontinued," a senior MSEB official said.
"Although, the PPA was signed much before MERC's formation, the dispute arose 
only over the past few months. And as such, we are seeking a hearing on these 
disputes," the official said. The Advocate General of Maharashtra, Mr Goolam 
E. Vahanvati, is expected to represent MSEB at the commission hearing. 
On Thursday, MSEB had issued a legal notice to Enron, stating that it had 
been forced to rescind the PPA and was avoiding the contract as DPC had 
"misrepresented material facts" while drawing up the PPA and hence, the board 
was "no more bound by the contract". 
According to the official, the PPA provides for full capacity availability 
within three hours of "cold start", for which MSEB has to pay a penalty of Rs 
17 lakh. 
MSEB had alleged that DPC's machines take five hours to reach full capacity 
and had slapped a rebate of Rs 401 crore in January 2001. 
"Following this, DPC not only said the performance curves in the PPA be 
replaced but that the plant profile did not fit the PPA to begin with. Also, 
a series of notices - arbitration, escrow, political force majeure and 
finally the preliminary termination notice - were slapped on the board," the 
official said. 
The board has now asked MERC to look into all disputes between the two 
companies. 
If DPC does not attend the hearing, the commission can give an 'ex-parte 
hearing', according to legal sources. According to Section 52 of the ERC Act, 
provisions of this Act have an overriding effect on all other Acts. 
The board will also seek damages to the tune of about Rs 700 crore, which 
includes the January rebate of Rs 401 crore and the subsequent two rebates 
amounting to Rs 300 crore, the official said. 
Meanwhile, negotiations between the two parties are expected to continue. 
"The Godbole committee meeting is scheduled on May 29. We would like to reach 
an understanding with DPC," the official said. 
The board has offered to continue buying power from DPC in spite of the 
notice to avoid inconvenience to the power company. 
Bill not accepted: Meanwhile, DPC refused to accept Rs 139 crore toward its 
April power purchase bill paid by MSEB under protest on Friday. 
The DPC spokesperson refused to comment on the company's decision. 
"We had sent them the bill amount but they did not accept it," a senior MSEB 
official said. 
The board now plans to deposit the money in DPC's bank account and send a 
separate protest letter to the company, as per PPA provisions.

DABHOL Power Company on Friday refused to accept the Rs 136.87-crore April 
electricity bill payment from Maharashtra State Electricity Board. 
"We sent the cheque to DPC, but they refused to accept it. We are yet to get 
any reply from them," said N M Mishra, director (finance) of MSEB. He said 
the money was parked in a Canara Bank account.
According to a senior MSEB official, the DPC move is in response to MSEB's 
notice to rescind the power purchase agreement issued on Thursday. 
"It seems that since MSEB is paying the cheque under protest, DPC is now 
looking at various legal implications," he said. The DPC spokesperson was not 
available for comments. 
Meanwhile, DPC on Friday held discussions with the power ministry officials 
in New Delhi. Enron managing director K Wade Cline met power secretary A K 
Basu and discussed the situation arising out of DPC serving a preliminary 
termination notice because of an unresolved six-month dispute over bills owed 
by MSEB. 
Basu said, "The Centre will do whatever possible to resolve the DPC-MSEB 
dispute at the earliest." 
The ministry has advised DPC to appear before Maharashtra government's 
negotiating committee headed by Madhav Godbole to plead their case. 
According to Basu, the Centre has appointed former telecom secretary A V 
Gokak on the committee for an early solution. 
"Gokak has been fully briefed and he would try to bring both sides on a 
common ground. But both the parties have to come to an understanding between 
themselves," he added.

Ganske Has Own War Chest To Take On Harkin for Senate
MATT KELLEY
WORLD-HERALD BUREAU

05/26/2001
Omaha World-Herald
Sunrise

(Copyright 2001 Omaha World-Herald Company)

Should it come down to personal wealth, Rep. Greg Ganske will have an edge in 
a 2002 Iowa Senate race with Sen. Tom Harkin. 
Ganske, a Republican who plans to challenge Harkin, held assets worth between 
$2.48 million and $5.63 million at the end of 2000, according to financial 
disclosure statements. Harkin, a Democrat, reported wealth between $363,000 
and $1.43 million.
Those figures, however, may prove irrelevant as both candidates have proved 
their ability to finance expensive campaigns without dipping into their 
personal fortunes. Not since Ganske's first run for office, in 1994, has 
either man spent his own money to get elected. 
"We're both pretty good fund-raisers," Ganske said Wednesday. 
The financial figures are reported each year on disclosure statements filed 
by every member of Congress. 
For the lawmakers from western Iowa, the most recent disclosure reports 
showed relatively little change from 1999. 
The maximum value of Republican Sen. Charles Grassley's assets dwindled a 
bit, from $5 million in 1999 to just under $3.4 million last year. Grassley, 
who farms in Butler County, keeps virtually all of his wealth in farmland and 
mutual funds. 
While the maximum value of Grassley's assets dwindled, the minimum value rose 
from $1 million in 1999 to $1.13 million last year. 
Grassley also reported loans for his farmland of between $115,000 and 
$300,000. His farms brought in $81,700 in income 2000 with just over $60,000 
in expenses, according to the report. 
Republican Rep. Tom Latham, who is part owner of a family farm and seed 
company, reported assets of between $1.5 million and $3.23 million in 2000. 
That's up from 1999, when Latham reported assets between $1.1 million and 
$2.6 million. 
Latham's disclosure report also shows a significant jump in investment 
income, from between $108,400 to just over $1 million. In 1999, Latham 
reported income of between $60,000 to $145,000. 
Most of that increase is due to income from his share of the family seed 
company, which in 2000 crept into reporting bracket with a $1 million 
ceiling. Latham's income from the company, however, is likely much closer to 
bracket's lower threshold of $100,000 - a level he did not exceed in 1999. 
Latham also reported a salary from Latham Seed Co. of $6,000. He reported a 
loan in Grand Junction, Iowa, for $15,000 to $50,000. 
As in 1999, Rep. Leonard Boswell's main source of investment income came from 
the sale of between $15,000 and $50,000 in calves from his farm in Decatur 
County. 
The Democrat's total wealth in 2000 stood between $402,000 and $880,000 - all 
of it tied to his farmland. He reported between $30,000 and $100,000 in farm 
loans. 
Aside from his congressional salary, Boswell earned just over $8,000 in 
pension payments from his service in the Iowa Legislature. His wife, Dody, 
earned just under $7,000 from Lamoni Community Schools. 
Ganske also held about the same level of assets and income over 1999. He 
reported between $112,100 and $273,000 in income, most it from stock 
dividends, interest and capital gains. 
Ganske's wife, Corrine, also works as a physician. They reported no 
liabilities. 
The majority of Ganske's wealth was in mutual funds. 
Should Ganske win the GOP primary to face Harkin, the race is likely to 
become pivotal as both parties jockey for control of the Senate. Both 
candidates will draw significant donations from outside the state, perhaps 
from party coffers in Washington. 
Even so, personal wealth can provide a comforting cushion in close races. 
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Ganske used $618,000 of his 
own money to help him defeat longtime Democratic incumbent Neal Smith in 
1994. 
Ganske will be mounting a similar challenge in 2002 against Harkin, a 
stalwart of Iowa's Democratic establishment. 
While smaller than Ganske's Harkin's portfolio contained a wide array of 
stock and bond holdings. In addition to various mutual funds, Harkin and his 
wife, Ruth, owned stock in Southwest Airlines, Lucent Technologies, Lehman 
Brothers and Kimberly Clark. 
And while he roundly criticizes the oil industry for reaping large profits, 
The Harkins own between $1,000 and $15,000 worth of common stock in Enron 
Corp., an energy company. Ruth Harkin owns between $25,000 and $100,000 in 
stock in Conoco Inc. and served on the oil company's board of directors. 
Her husband recently issued a statement that he has always been proud of his 
wife's career.

Senate confirms Texan to energy commission

(Copyright 2001)

WASHINGTON - The Senate confirmed on Friday a Texas ally of President Bush 
and a Pennsylvania electricity regulator to become commissioners on the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
The voice-vote confirmation filled two Republican vacancies on the 
increasingly visible five-member commission, which has come under intense 
scrutiny in recent months over its actions to correct the wholesale power 
market chaos in California.
Confirmed were Pat Wood III, head of the Texas Public Utility Commission, 
which is handling the deregulation of electricity in Texas, and Nora 
Brownell, a regulator in Pennsylvania, where deregulated power markets have 
been called a model. Wood's term runs through mid-2005; Brownell's will 
expire a year later. 
FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert, a Republican, will retain his post. The two 
Democrats on the commission, William Massey and Linda Breathitt, also remain 
on board. 
Also Friday, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., called for hearings into 
possible improprieties between FERC members and private energy interests. 
In her letter, Feinstein cited a report in the New York Times on Friday that 
Ken Lay, the chairman of the Enron Corp., had told Hebert that he would 
support his continuation in the job if the commissioner endorsed the 
company's views on energy deregulation. Houston-based Enron is the nation's 
largest electricity trader. 
Hebert said he rejected Lay's offer. Lay told the Times that it was Hebert 
who asked him to intercede with White House officials. The president appoints 
the commission and names its chairman.

DUMB TALK / California AG's remarks crude and deceptive
Staff

05/26/2001
Houston Chronicle

(Copyright 2001)

By now many Houstonians are aware of the inappropriate and totally dumb 
remark California Attorney General Bill Lockyer made about Enron Corp. 
Chairman Kenneth Lay earlier this week. 
"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share 
with a tattooed dude who says, `Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer is 
reported to have said in a May 22 story in The Wall Street Journal.
Lockyer would like the world to blame Enron and other Texas-based energy 
companies for California's rolling blackouts. 
His crude remark is not only dumb, but also calculated to deceive, because he 
and other California legislators who approved the state's partial electricity 
deregulation (Lockyer was a member of the Legislature) can only blame 
themselves for California's shortages. 
Lockyer's personal attack on Lay was beneath anyone with even a modicum of 
civility. It was all the more appalling because such gutter talk by 
California's top law enforcement official is not helpful in resolving 
California's problems, particularly when Lockyer, as the Golden State's 
attorney general, is supposedly conducting a fair and impartial investigation 
into the crisis.

Having appointed global management consultants Arthur Andersen to value its 
business worth in the country, Enron has now sent on deputation most of its 
100-odd employees to two of its subsidiaries, Dabhol Power Company and 
Broadband Solutions Pvt Ltd. 
According to sources, with Enron Corp deciding not to undertake any fresh 
investments in the country, the team at Enron India had to be deployed 
elsewhere in its existing lines of business, DPC and BSPL. While DPC is 
embroiled in a controversy, BSPL has made investments to the tune of $30 
million in setting up data centres in India.
Sources further said that Enron India, in effect, has been reduced to a shell 
company merely holding stakes in Dabhol and Broadband Solutions. They also 
said that several employees had put in their papers since they were no longer 
handling tasks for which they were originally hired. 
When contacted, a company spokesperson said, "Those on the MetGas and fibre 
optic projects have been reassigned." He however refused to comment on the 
total number of employees deputed elsewhere.

Power firm vetted Bush energy regulators
JULIAN BORGER IN WASHINGTON

Julian Borger in Washington 
Applicants for jobs on the commission regulating the US energy market have 
been vetted by the Enron Corporation, the country's biggest electricity power 
company and a significant contributor to George Bush's election campaign, 
according to a report published yesterday.
Soon after being appointed chairman of the federal energy regulatory 
commission, Curtis Hebert told the New York Times, he received a telephone 
call from the Enron president, Kenneth Lay, offering the company's backing to 
help him keep his job if he adapted his views on deregulation. 
Mr Hebert said he was offended by the approach and turned down the offer. 
His appointment as chairman, which was provisional pending the nomination of 
other members of the commission, has since been called into question by 
Vice-President Dick Cheney. 
Mr Hebert's chief of staff, Walter Ferguson, confirmed the newspaper account 
yesterday. '[Mr Hebert] has always been forthright and he's been a 
straight-shooter with folks in the industry,' he said. 
Mr Lay, a close friend of the Bush family, confirmed that the telephone call 
took place, but said it was Mr Hebert who asked for Enron's backing to keep 
his job. 
Either way, environmentalists and other critics of President Bush argue, the 
fact that the conversation took place at all demonstrates the leading role 
corporations like Enron have in making energy policy in Washington under the 
new administration. 
According to a joint investigation by the New York Times and Public 
Broadcasting Service (PBS), Mr Lay and other Enron executives interviewed 
other candidate members of the regulatory commission and supplied the 
president's personnel adviser, Clay Johnson, with a list of the company's 
preferred candidates. 
The two commissioners Mr Bush chose to fill the vacant Republican seats both 
had the backing of Enron and other power companies. 
'It just confirms what we believed and what we've been saying, that the 
Bush-Cheney energy plan is written by corporations and it's in the interests 
of the corporations,' said Kevin Curtis, vice-president for government 
affairs of the National Environmental Trust, a Washington pressure group. 
Enron, a Dollars 100 billion behem oth in the energy trading market, was a 
significant backer of Mr Bush in last year's election. It contributed Dollars 
1.7m to Republican candidates, 72% of its total campaign spending. 
It is a strong supporter of deregulation in the electric power market, in 
particular the opening up of state markets to outside suppliers. 
At the time of the phone call from Mr Lay, Mr Hebert had launched an 
investigation of the pricing policies of big electricity traders, such as 
Enron. 
'One of our problems is that we do not have the expertise to truly unravel 
the complex arbitrage activities of a company like Enron,' he told the New 
York Times, adding: 'We're trying to do it now and we may have some results 
soon.' 
Mr Ferguson confirmed yesterday that the investigation would continue. 
The large-scale deregulation of regional electricity markets since 1996 has 
failed to reduce prices in many states, and since the chaos and power 
shortages produced by the botched deregulation in California, the pace of 
market reform has slowed down, much to the frustration of Enron. 
In their telephone conversation, a few weeks after Mr Hebert's appointment, 
he said Mr Lay told him that 'he and Enron would like to support me as 
chairman, but we would have to agree on principles'. 
Those principles would involve the pace and nature of deregulation. 
Mr Lay said that there was 'never any intent' to link Mr Hebert's employment 
with the commission's policies. 
When Mr Hebert, a former Mississippi state regulator, was given the 
chairman's job in January, the White House told him he would keep it at least 
until Mr Bush's other nominees, Pat Wood and Nora Brownell, were confirmed by 
the Senate. 
Their appointment was confirmed this week, and Vice-President Cheney told PBS 
that Mr Wood, head of the Texas public utility commission, should now get Mr 
Hebert's job. 
Mr Ferguson said yesterday that the president was the only one who could 
decide whether Mr Hebert should keep his job. 
Other candidates for seats on the commission also say that Enron played a 
role in the selection process. Joe Garcia, a Florida regulator and now a 
leader of the Cuban-American National Foundation, an exile pressure group, 
said he was interviewed by Mr Lay and other Enron officials.

CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS
Changes in Senate could offer state relief

COPLEY NEWS SERVICE

The San Diego Union-Tribune

WASHINGTON -- After weeks of impasse, a plan to bring emergency relief to 
California's suffering electricity customers suddenly seems likely in the 
Senate because a sympathetic friend unexpectedly finds himself in a position 
to help. 
This dramatic reversal of fortune will occur when Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., 
becomes chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee because 
of Vermont Sen. James Jeffords' defection from the GOP.
Bingaman is expected to take control of the committee next week when Jeffords 
officially becomes a political independent and throws control of the chamber 
to the Democratic Party. Bingaman will replace Sen. Frank Murkowski, 
R-Alaska, a strong ally of the energy industry. 
Unlike Murkowski, Bingaman supports a bill championed by Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., to impose temporary restraints 
on wholesale power sales in the West. The bill is likely to command a 
majority if it comes to a vote in the committee. 
The price caps still face fierce resistance in the House and at the other end 
of Pennsylvania Avenue, where President Bush, armed with a veto pen, and Vice 
President Dick Cheney steadfastly resist movement toward any form of price 
controls. 
But because of a committee chairman's agenda-setting power, Bingaman's 
ascension would dramatically shift the prospects of the Feinstein bill and 
other energy issues in the Senate. 
Bush's proposal to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil 
exploration already faced difficulty, but now opponents will have easier 
means to block it. And other environmentally contentious energy proposals 
could face tough scrutiny from Jeffords, who is expected to become chairman 
of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee. 
Still, the president will have the power to enact the bulk of his energy 
program because fewer than two dozen of his 105 proposals need congressional 
action. 
But the shift in the Senate allows Democrats to advance their own plan. At 
the top of the list are temporary price controls. 
"It's a priority for Sen. Bingaman," said Jude McCartin, a spokeswoman for 
the senator. "He would like to act quickly to meet the challenges." 
"Bingaman is from a Western state, unlike Murkowski," said Ashley Brown, 
executive director of an electricity-policy think tank at Harvard University. 
"His geographic outlook is going to be different. He is also going to be 
sensitive to Democratic senators from California. It's going to mean more to 
him than it meant to Murkowski." 
McCartin and aides to Feinstein were guardedly optimistic about the measure's 
prospects should the bill reach the Senate floor, where its bipartisan 
parentage will likely guarantee bipartisan backing. 
That does not mean Feinstein's bill is home-free. 
Bush and Cheney's opposition to price caps is rooted firmly in their belief 
that they would discourage investment in the energy industry, thereby 
resulting in even shorter power supplies and more California blackouts. 
In the House, a companion bill to the Feinstein-Smith measure is snarled in 
complex and inconclusive negotiations in the House Energy and Commerce 
Committee, and the House Republican leadership would be poised to bury any 
measure that might make it to the floor in defiance of Bush's wishes. 
But other factors may be bolstering prospects for action to ease the 
California crisis. 
McCartin pointed to the Senate's unanimous vote yesterday afternoon 
confirming two Bush nominees to posts on the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission as signaling a possibly more activist bureaucratic policy in 
dealing with the state's problems. 
The two new members of the nation's major regulatory authority over the power 
industry are Pat Wood III, the head of the Texas Utility Commission, and Nora 
Brownell, a Pennsylvania utility regulator. 
Bush reportedly plans to replace FERC Chairman Curtis Hebert with Wood. 
While observers say it is unlikely that Wood and Brownell would defy the 
White House, they note that the appointees have indicated they might take a 
more expansive view than most current FERC commissioners to bring relief to 
California. 
Once the Democrats take formal control of the Senate, probably about June 5, 
there could be other actions affecting California's power problems. 
Feinstein yesterday urged the likely chairman of the Senate Governmental 
Affairs Committee, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., to investigate whether 
energy companies are improperly influencing the FERC. 
She cited a report in yesterday's New York Times that Kenneth Lay, the head 
of Enron Corp., a Houston-based power marketing company, had offered to back 
Hebert in his effort to remain at the commission's helm if Hebert supported 
Enron's positions on electricity deregulation. 
Enron outpaced all other energy companies last year in contributing to GOP 
campaigns, while Lay has personally been one of Bush's most generous 
financial backers. 
"Since FERC has refused to fulfill its legally mandated function under the 
Federal Power Act to restore `just and reasonable' electricity rates, we need 
to ask whether undue influence by the companies that FERC regulates has 
resulted in its failure to act," Feinstein wrote in a letter to Lieberman. 
Senate passage of the Feinstein-Smith bill would send the measure to the 
House, where some Republican House members from California face close 
re-election races next year. 
A Field Poll recently showed that 75 percent of state residents view the 
electricity situation as "very serious" and that 59 percent say it was caused 
by energy companies seeking to increase profits. 
Democratic strategists, citing those findings, say some California lawmakers 
visiting their districts over the Memorial Day recess may come under pressure 
to take strong action to restrain energy prices.

INSIDE TRACK - Back in the saddle for a rough ride - INTERVIEW KENNETH LAY, ENRON - The US energy group's chairman tells Sheila McNulty of the job facing him after the sudden departure of the com. 
A3ft elephant,a gift from the Indian government, stands under a spotlight outside the office of Kenneth Lay. That the head of Enron, US energy titan, has not seen fit to remove this reminder of a protracted battle with one of India's state electricity boards - one of the most painful episodes in Enron's history - is testament to his thick skin.
Was this imperviousness lacking in Mr Lay's hand-picked successor? Earlier this month Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive after six months in the job, citing "personal reasons". The men had known each other well. They had worked together for more than a dozen years, first when Mr Skilling was a consultant with McKinsey and then side by side since 1990, when Mr Lay persuaded him to join Enron. 
Mr Lay was surprised at his protege's premature departure but the 59-year-old has slipped easily back into his former job as chief executive, while continuing as chairman. He acknowledges that he might have explored Mr Skilling's personal issues more thoroughly before handing him the job. 
"I knew quite a bit about his personal life and his family life and his kids and all," Mr Lay says. "I think some of these personal and family issues evolved, or certainly became much more important even, since he became chief executive. Maybe I should have probed him a little bit more about that area of his life but until something like this happens you don't really think about that." 
Both men have declined to say precisely what led to Mr Skilling's departure. The company is not facing financial difficulties. In the 15 years Mr Lay was chief executive, Mr Skilling helped him to transform Enron from a regional natural gas pipeline company into a leading electricity, natural gas and communications company. Its market capitalisation rose from $2bn to $70bn. The company reported revenue of $101bn ( #70bn) in 2000. 
Yet there is plenty to trouble the occupant of the chief executive's office. Enron is embroiled in a public controversy over a power plant in India and a separate battle with the authorities in California and has faced difficulties building its broadband business. Mr Lay says the situations in India and California have "stabilised" and the company has taken steps to cut its losses in broadband. Enron has decided to end the unhappy episode in India by selling the power project. And it is one of several energy traders facing questions in California over accusations of a manipulation of power prices - something it denies. 
These issues have weighed on the stock price, which has fallen 54 per cent since the start of the year. Mr Lay says that might have influenced Mr Skilling's decision to leave. The main motives, he insists, were "personal and family issues" that Mr Skilling could not put off dealing with for two or three years. "Did he feel quite a bit of pressure from the standpoint of the stock price going down and did he internalise that more than he needed to? Probably so," Mr Lay says. 
So how does Mr Lay keep the next chief executive from doing the same? How does he ensure that person will not let personal issues force him out? Maybe, he says, he will probe a bit more. "But it's kind of like fighting the last war. I think this is an unusual situation." 
Nonetheless, Mr Lay has decided to take more time over the appointment. "There is no big rush," he says. He himself will remain chief executive for as long as it takes to find the right person for the job. He spent days, or weeks at the most, before settling on the 47-year-old Mr Skilling. This time, he may well spend years in the search. 
"The board has made it very clear that we are going to take our time. I have extended my contract through 2005. I'll stay that long if needed. I'll stay longer if needed. But we're going to take our time. We're going to make sure that we make the right choice," Mr Lay says. "We're going to make sure that the financial community agrees that that would be the right choice. We're going to make sure that, obviously, the employees and the organisation believe that is going to be the right choice." 
He started the process on Tuesday by appointing Greg Whalley, president and chief operating officer of Enron Wholesale Services, and Mark Frevert, chairman and chief executive of Enron Wholesale Services, to the office of the chairman. Mr Whalley was also promoted to president and chief operating officer of Enron, while Mr Frevert was promoted to vice-chairman of the company. The men are on the short-list for chief executive, though Mr Lay will continuously review the ranks for other candidates. After all, the job of chief executive is a difficult one. 
"The demands on a chief executive have been much greater than they used to be and, in fact, I think maybe part of it is just the fast-paced world we live in, where we have so much information and everything is instantaneous," Mr Lay says. "Everybody knows what a company's performance is, what it is going to be, what it should have been before. In many cases, the pressure itself gets to people." 
More importantly, he adds, if the company is not performing well, boards are not as patient as they used to be and shareholders do not want them to be. He says this was not so with Mr Skilling, who left on his own terms and therefore without a severance package. Mr Lay does not make a scapegoat of Mr Skilling for any of the company's problems, insisting that the men made strategic decisions together. 
He says, however, that he will try to provide more information about the company to analysts, who have complained about keeping up with fast-growing Enron as it moves into new areas and markets. That will mean segmenting its businesses more to make apparent where growth is and what returns on invested capital Enron is getting in various businesses. Mr Lay says he does not know whether Mr Skilling communicated as well as he intends to. 
"I think Jeff is a good communicator. But, as I say, we probably have different styles. Certainly I will see if my style will work any better now ...I expect it is a little bit more relaxed than his probably is - probably, in part, because I've been in this position before and for quite a while. I try not to internalise or personalise any criticism or comments." 
Certainly that keeps the focus on running the company. Mr Lay says his next replacement will be a strong leader in and outside the company: someone well versed in Enron and its various businesses, who lives its values and is able to express the company's strategies and vision, as well as its progress. "And just by the nature of this job, somebody who has got great endurance, who really shows that they can operate at a very high level consistently, over a long period of time," he says. 
"Because it also is a job that does carry with it certain demands and pressures and if you don't have that endurance, sometimes you have a tough time continuing the pace. 
"I personally think Jeff had all of the skills he needed to be a great chief executive and I think that except for these personal and family issues, if he had stayed here long enough he would have been a great chief executive," Mr Lay says. 
"But we'll never know for sure, will we?"

California Energy Alliance to Fight for Direct Access Utilities: Group may go to court to keep customers who want to choose their own power provider.

Electricity marketers said Wednesday that they may sue state utility regulators over their latest plan to end customers' ability to shop around for power. 
The marketers, which compete with the traditional utilities to sell power to business and residential customers, said they were stunned by a draft decision by the California Public Utilities Commission to suspend "direct access" retroactively to July 1. The marketers have been rushing to sign up new customers in recent weeks, assuming that the PUC decision would not take effect before Sept. 1.
The PUC, in issuing the proposal Monday, said it seeks to protect the flow of revenue that will be used to repay $13.4 billion in bonds the state intends to sell to pay for electricity. 
The draft decision--as well as other bond-related measures scheduled before the PUC on Sept. 6--is expected to generate a parade of lawsuits, any of which could delay the issuing of the bonds. 
The commissioners and state lawmakers fear that a flight of customers, especially large businesses, from the traditional utilities would saddle the remaining consumers with an unfair burden in paying off the bonds. The money raised by the bonds will be used to pay for power the state is buying on behalf of Southern California Edison, Pacific Gas & Electric and San Diego Gas & Electric. 
Direct access was a key element of the 1998 deregulation of the state's power market because it ended the utilities' retail monopolies. 
But the state Legislature, worried that too many customers would abandon utility service, passed legislation this year directing the PUC to suspend the program. 
PUC Administrative Law Judge Robert Barnett moved the suspension date back to July 1, arguing that customers and marketers had been given ample time to prepare for the suspension since Gov. Gray Davis signed the legislation in February. 
Such a retroactive suspension would be an unconstitutional government abrogation of existing contracts and seizure of private property without just compensation, said Daniel W. Douglass, a Woodland Hills lawyer representing the Alliance for Retail Energy Markets. 
The group, which includes electricity marketers such as AES NewEnergy, Enron, Green Mountain Energy and Calpine, is preparing a lawsuit should the PUC adopt the draft decision, Douglass said. 
"We believe retroactivity is fundamentally unfair to both direct access customers" and marketers, he said. 
"We are not trying to delay the bonds. We think they are very important," Douglass said. "We think the state has created a self-inflicted injury by instituting retroactivity."

French Power Spot Market to Start in October
By Sarah Wachter

PARIS -- Euronext Paris SA is planning an October launch for a spot electricity market for France that will be called Powernext, a person who works in the industry and was close to the negotiations said. 
When it starts, up to 12 companies will trade on Powernext, including some of the current partners in Powernext and U.S. groups Enron and TXU Europe Power Trading, the person said. Physical electricity will be traded in hourly blocks for delivery the following day, using the same El-Web trading platform and price-configuring system of Nord Pool, the power market operator for the Nordic region, the person said.
Daily volumes on Powernext are expected to reach 24 gigawatt-hours within six months of the launch, and annual volumes should reach 15 terawatt-hours in 2002, the person said. That annual volume represents about 13% of total electricity consumed by French industrial consumers that are eligible to switch suppliers. 
Starting early next year, Powernext will also provide weather information, including temperature data for French towns and cities, as a service to members, the person said. Data on temperatures and precipitation is vital for electricity trading decisions. Electricity consumption is highly dependent on the weather because it can't be stored. 
Euronext holds 24% of Powernext, and HGRT, a financial holding for European electricity grid operators, holds 17%. The remaining 49% is divided equally among French banks BNP Paribas and Societe Generale, state-owned Electricite de France, oil giant TotalFinaElf and Belgian utility Electrabel.

UK: Enron trades UK St Fergus beach gas online.

08/30/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

LONDON, Aug 30 (Reuters) - U.S.-owned utility Enron said on Thursday it had started trading gas at the St Fergus terminal in northern Scotland on its online system. 
The company is offering to trade St Fergus beach gas for winter periods Q4 2001 and Q1 2002 but only for an hour between 1130 and 1230 local time, it said in a statement.
St Fergus is the largest gas terminal in Britain, handling gas from many North Sea fields. 
Beach gas is offshore gas and purchasers will be responsible for paying entry capacity, or access rights, to bring the gas onshore into the national pipeline system. 
Enron, which already trades gas at the notional national balancing point (NBP) online, decided to expand to St Fergus to increase liquidity in the short-term beach gas market, said Peter Crilly, head of UK gas at Enron. 
"St Fergus is not a liquid market. It is the location where entry is the biggest issue - there are constraints getting gas from St Fergus to the south where demand is," Crilly told Reuters. 
Enron is bidding to buy winter gas at St Fergus at between two and 3.5 pence below NBP prices and will sell it at a discount between 0.7 and two pence, the prices reflecting the cost of buying entry capacity. 
St Fergus beach gas trades in the over-the-counter market but volume is tiny compared with NBP trade.

LONDON -(Dow Jones)- Enron Europe Ltd. (U.ENE) Thursday will start offering natural gas for delivery at the St Fergus terminal in Scotland on its Internet trading platform Enrononline, said Peter Crilly, the company's head of U.K. gas. 
"We hope to help provide liquidity and transparency in prices throughout the winter, he told Dow Jones Newswires.
Prices for gas to be delivered at the Scottish terminal in the fourth quarter 2001 and the first quarter 2002 will be posted daily between 1030 GMT and 1130 GMT, he said. 
Enrononline has so far enabled traders to exchange gas for delivery at the National Balancing Point, a notional point on the pipeline network, the most common delivery point for the majority of U.K. gas trades. 
The announcement follows the completion late Wednesday of the first tranche of pipeline operator Transco's pipeline entry capacity auctions for the period October 2001-March 2002.

India: Assets of Dabhol Power Company: Whose property are they anyway?

08/30/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

DPC is a nexus of property rights of several lenders and shareholders. 
Though Enron's claims are financial in nature, they are subordinate to that of DPC's lenders. If DPC fails in meeting its obligations to its lenders, Enron is liable to meet the unfulfilled obligations in proportion to its holding. After meeting the liability along with other shareholders, it merely remains the dominant shareholder of DPC, says G. Ramachandran and A. Srikanth.
IT IS customary in India to begin public debates with an "at-the-outset" disclaimer based on reasoned neutrality. We assert at the outset that we have no partisan position to take in the dispute that involves the Dabhol Power Company (DPC), Enron, the Government of Maharashtra and the Government of India. However, the statement made by Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman, Enron, an energy company based in the US, provides an opportunity for an examination of the principles and practices pertinent to the ownership of corporate assets and the rights and claims of investors. 
Mr Lay has been reported to have said that US laws could prevent the US Government from providing any aid or assistance to India if the property of US companies were expropriated. His statement on US laws on the expropriation of US property may be based on his assumption that the assets of DPC are US property. Such an assumption pertinent to the ownership claims and assets of DPC is implicit in his provocative statement. 
Since Enron owns 65 per cent of DPC's equity stock, his statement raises two critical questions: Are the assets of DPC the property of Enron? Are the assets of DPC US property? Answers to these are important because of the growing globalisation of economic activity and the rapid growth in the ownership of economic assets by companies promoted by global corporations. Moreover, India has a well-established policy of enabling significant investments by foreign companies in companies incorporated in India. 
Independent legal status 
Every corporation, from a perspective based on the theory of the firm propounded by Professors Michael C. Jensen and William H. Meckling, is a nexus of contractual claims and rights. The corporation owns the assets; managers deploy the assets to produce cash flows. 
The corporate form of organisation bestows upon a firm a legal status that is independent of its lenders and shareholders. Since they supply financial capital, their claims are principally financial in nature. 
Companies own the assets and the suppliers of capital have a claim on the cash flows in a pattern that is predetermined by the contractual claims. Laws in India, North America, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa unambiguously reflect the independent legal status of incorporated entities. 
Corporate assets, contractual rights and pecking order Mr Lay has provoked a debate on the ownership of corporate assets. 
The debate extends to the nature and scope of the contractual claims held by shareholders and creditors in a modern environment that separates ownership of corporate assets from the managerial control of corporate assets. 
Contractual claims govern the financial and non- financial rights of shareholders and creditors. Shareholders have the right to choose the corporation's managers by a vote and to set the corporation's business goals and policies. The managers determine the deployment of corporate assets and operating plans aimed at running the business profitably. 
To balance the interests of lenders against such an important economic right, lenders have the first claim on a company's after-tax cash flows. Lenders also have a first claim on its assets if obligations are not met when they fall due. Claims of lenders and creditors precede the claims of equity shareholders. The shareholders of the corporation have a claim on the residual cash flows, but only after the claims of lenders and creditors have been met. 
Lenders and creditors find a place higher than shareholders in the pecking order in the financial affairs of corporations. Lenders have the right to nominate one or directors, to impose important covenants on the disposition of assets, and to determine the actions that may be necessary when a corporation fails to meet its financial obligations. 
DPC and global suppliers of capital 
DPC is, in our view, both a domestic corporation and a global corporation. 
It is a domestic corporation because it is incorporated in India. 
It has been incorporated with unlimited liability and this has important implications and repercussions for its global shareholders, and Enron, in particular, since it is the dominant shareholder. 
DPC is a global corporation since it has accessed capital from global sources of equity and debt. The equity sources include investors such as India's Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) and General Electric's Japanese subsidiary. MSEB holds 15 per cent of DPC's voting stock. Other global investors, including the subsidiaries of Bechtel and General Electric, hold the remaining 20 per cent. DPC has an array of domestic and global lenders. Thus, DPC is a nexus of contractual rights and not all rights are vested with institutions based in the US. 
Limited and unlimited liability of shareholders 
The liability of a company to its lenders has an impact on its shareholders. 
The nature of incorporation determines the impact. The liability of shareholders of a company incorporated with limited liability is limited to their equity investment in that company. They are not obligated to meet any residual dues owed to the company's lenders, bondholders and other creditors. 
Shareholders of a limited liability company can walk out of a company in default. The assets of the company may be reconfigured to meet the claims of secured creditors and then the other unsecured creditors, in that order. If the proceeds from the reconfiguration of assets are insufficient, the risk of default is borne by the company's creditors. 
In contrast, the liability of the shareholders of a company incorporated with unlimited liability is not limited to their equity investment in that company. Shareholders are obligated to fully compensate the company's lenders and bondholders and meet the unredeemed and unpaid claims of other creditors including suppliers, employees and governments. 
Shareholders of a company incorporated with limited liability enjoy a high level of protection that is not offered to shareholders of a company incorporated with unlimited liability. Hence, all other things being the same, shares in a limited liability company are more valuable than that in an unlimited liability company. DPC has been incorporated with unlimited liability in India. It is our conjecture that DPC was incorporated with unlimited liability at the insistence of the local government. 
DPC and contractual rights 
We now turn to answering the two principal questions. DPC's status as an unlimited liability company is reckoned with. First, are the assets of DPC the property of Enron? The assets of DPC are that of a separate legal entity. DPC is a nexus of property rights of several lenders and shareholders. Lenders enjoy precedence over shareholders, and Enron is one of four shareholders though it is the dominant shareholder. 
Enron's claims are financial in nature, but the claims are clearly subordinate to that of DPC's lenders. If DPC fails in meeting its obligations to its lenders, Enron is liable to meet the unfulfilled obligations in proportion to its holding. After meeting the liability along with other shareholders, it merely remains the dominant shareholder of DPC. It does not become the owner of the assets of DPC. 
Second, are the assets of DPC US property? If the right of lenders to determine the actions when DPC fails to meet its financial obligations is accepted legally, it may be argued that lenders can gain legal control over DPC's assets. Since DPC has domestic and global lenders, the vesting of legal control would not be confined to lenders in the US. A part of the assets of DPC may be deemed to be US property, but only if Enron and other shareholders do not fulfil their obligations. 
However, Mr Lay may have reckoned with the opportunistic application of laws relating to corporate assets and liabilities in India. The case of Union Carbide India Ltd (UCIL), a company incorporated with limited liability in India, comes to mind. Mr Warren Andersen, the chairman of Union Carbide in the US at the time of the Bhopal gas tragedy in December 1984, was taken into custody when he landed in India. 
Mr Andersen had exercised volition when he travelled to India after the fatal leak to commiserate with the people of India, but was held responsible for the actions of UCIL. The actions of the Government of India in 1984 were seen to be based on assumptions that were incompatible with the separation of ownership and control and with UCIL's status as a separate Indian entity in which Union Carbide of the US was a shareholder. 
Mr Lay may yet anticipate adverse action against Enron if something unfavourable was to happen, and DPC was seen as the cause. Hence, he may have feared as well as hoped that DPC was Enron's property and, as a result, US property. His quick retraction has confused many. 
Some may have been lulled into complacency. The resolution of the ambiguity in contractual claims and property rights in a global environment is critical to India's economic future. Mr Kenneth Lay, chairman, Enron, has done us a favour by provoking a debate.

India's Godbole on Enron's Offer to Sell, Power Thefts: Comment
2001-08-30 06:03 (New York)


     Mumbai, Aug. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Madhav Godbole, the chief
negotiator in a payments dispute between Dabhol Power Co., Enron
Corp.'s local unit, and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board,
comments on Enron plan to sell the project and on power thefts
in the country.

     ``Enron wants back its equity. It's not big sacrifice
they're making. They're in fact asking for the moon.
     ``Enron will have to take a drastic reduction on their
equity as well. All stakeholders will have to take a hit'' on
their share capital and loans.

     Enron has said it's willing to sell to the government its
stake in Dabhol at cost. It's owed $64 million in unpaid bills
by the electricity board, its only customer. The board in May
stopped buying power, saying it's too expensive.

     ``The (federal) government should give (Maharashtra) state
government 250 billion rupees ($5 billion) in loans, which it
could use to pay back foreign currency loans'' used to fund the
$3 billion project, India's biggest foreign investment.

     ``You can't have loans linked to the U.S. dollar. It raises
the cost of power.'' The Indian rupee has depreciated by about 5
percent annually against the U.S. dollar in the past.

On electricity thefts:

     ``There must be political courage to implement the law of
land rigorously. Only then will you see things changing.

     ``But it appears that we take decisions only when things
reach crisis proportions. A crisis-like situation will have to
arise before we find a solution to the problem.''

     The World Bank estimates 18 percent of the power generated
in India is stolen, compared with 8 percent in China.

On using meters to curb thefts:

     ``There are pros and cons to the argument metering will
help reduce thefts.
     ``Farmers in Maharashtra alone use as many as two million
water pumps. How will you monitor or reads bills every month.
It's not going to be easy.

     ``There's nothing wrong in selling subsidized power to
farmers as long as the tariff covers fixed costs. It must be
revenue-neutral.''

     The government has set December as a deadline to complete
metering of all consumers.

On the proposed electricity law:

     ``The new Electricity Bill 2001 is an improvement over
policies followed in the past. Ultimately the states will have
to get people to pay for power they use.

     ``There will have to be political preparedness, which is
not evident today. Passing a law won't take us anywhere; you'll
have another law in the statue book.

      ``It's a question of what happens in practice -- on the
ground. We decided seven years ago to charge farmers a minimum
50-paise per unit. Still, states like Punjab and Tamil Nadu sell
electricity to farmers for nothing.''

On doubling India's generation capacity:

     ``The Power Minister wants to double India's capacity'' to
200,000 megawatts in next ten years. ``But where is the demand''
for more power?

     ``Eight states showed interest in buying Enron power. But
they needed 1,300 megawatts and only during times of peak demand
and at a particular price.

     ``Today the revenue from selling additional unit of power
is less than the cost of producing it. State electricity boards
don't want it.''

     ``It's time the government gets out of power business all
together and leaves it to private power producers and generators
to decide amongst themselves.

     ``There must be one regulatory body to ensure tariffs fixed
are reasonable and solve payments and other disputes. Let that
be the rule of the game.''


Oman LNG Denies Report of Delay in Shipment to India's Dhabol
2001-08-30 05:53 (New York)


     Muscat, Oman, Aug. 30 (Bloomberg) -- Oman LNG LLC, in which
Royal Dutch/Shell has a 30 percent stake, said it is only revising
a tentative date for making its first delivery of liquefied
natural gas to India's Dhabol Power Co. rather than delaying the
shipment, as a paper reported today.

     Dhabol Power, in which the U.S.'s Enron Corp. owns a 65
percent stake, signed a 20-year agreement with Oman LNG in 1998 to
take 1.6 million tons a year of liquid gas, and set October this
year as a possible start date for deliveries, said Julian Barnes,
a spokesman for Oman LNG. Bahrain's Gulf Daily News had reported
that the first shipment was delayed to February from November.

     The facilities for receiving the gas at Dhabol will not be
ready until early next year, Barnes said. ``There's no delay. The
original start date was set nearly three years ago, so it was just
an estimate which was always open to change.''

     Dhabol, which cost $1 billion to build, is locked in a
payments dispute with the local Maharashtra state government that
owes it $45 million in bills, according to London's Financial
Times. Oman LNG remains committed to supplying Dhabol, its second-
largest customer after Korea Gas Corp., Barnes said.

     Oman LNG, which made its first-ever delivery last April, is
seeking to refinance as much as $1.3 billion of debt, including
selling $500 million of bonds, the company's chief executive,
Graham Searle, said in an interview on Tuesday. Investor concern
over the Dhabol contract could reduce appetite for the debt.

     The majority state-owned company, in which France's
TotalElfFina has a 5.54 percent stake, is also considering
building a third production line to add to its 6.6 million tons a
year capacity, Searle said.

Briefs: Houston & state 
Settlement ends lawsuit over Azurix
WILMINGTON, Del. -- Shareholders of Azurix Corp., a wastewater services management company, settled a lawsuit Wednesday over parent Enron Corp.'s $275 million stock buyback offer last year. 
Houston-based Enron said in October 2000 it would pay $7 for each of Azurix's outstanding shares to take the unit private. In seven lawsuits filed in Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, stock owners said the shares were worth more. 
After negotiations among lawyers, Enron agreed to increase the price to $8.375 per share, adding $52.5 million. The transaction was completed in March. 



Judge rejects Enron request to halt legislative subpoena
By JENNIFER COLEMAN
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SACRAMENTO (AP) - A Sacramento Superior Court judge rejected energy company Enron's request to quash a subpoena issued by a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation in California's energy market. 
Judge Charles Kobayashi denied two of Enron's three motions Wednesday in tentative rulings, saying the court had no right to interfere with a legislative subpoena.
Enron sued the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation in July to stop the subpoena of its financial and electricity trading records. Among its objections were that only the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the authority to investigate wholesale markets. 
The committee has sought documents from six energy companies as they investigate last year's price spikes in the wholesale electricity market. 
In his tentative ruling on Enron's motion asking for a protective order, Kobayashi said he was "sympathetic to Enron's concern for safeguarding its trade secret information." 
But he added that the court couldn't assume the committee would divulge the confidential documents and Enron's constitutional rights weren't "jeopardized by delivery of their secrets to the document depository." 
On the other motion, to quash the subpoena, the judge found the committee did follow proper procedure when serving Enron officials. 
Attorneys for the committee and Enron will return to court Thursday on the tentative rulings. Kobayashi set a court date for Sept. 7 on the third motion, which is a request for an injunction of the committee's investigation and contempt proceedings. 
Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne declined to comment on the tentative ruling until after Thursday's hearing. 
In a similar case Wednesday in San Francisco Superior Court, a judge said he would consider protections for Enron documents subpoenaed by Attorney General Bill Lockyer. Lockyer is also investigating possible price manipulation of the energy market. 
"In the attorney general case, we were granted the protective order," Denne said. "It's basically on the same issue, over a subpoena for documents." 
Lockyer spokesman Nathan Barankin said the judge will consider safeguards to keep the documents confidential, such as a secure document repository where investigators could see the documents. But the judge also said Enron can't deny the information to the attorney general, Barankin said. 
Enron, Barankin said, failed in its attempt to find a legal way to deny Lockyer access to information to guide an investigation. 
Lockyer's staff and Enron plan to meet this week to work out the details of the protective order and the judge could review that by next week. 
Enron officials have said the company is prepared to turn over 25,000 documents that were already in California, but that other documents the committee wants are in Texas and out of the panel's reach. 
The committee found Enron in contempt for not turning over the documents. A full report on the contempt finding has been sent to the full Senate, which has not voted on it. A contempt report on Reliant Energy has also been sent to the Senate. 
A contempt finding against Mirant Corp. was later reversed when the company opened a document depository in Sacramento for the committee's investigators. 
If the full Senate imposes sanctions against Reliant or Enron, it will be the first time since 1929, when the Senate voted to jail reluctant witnesses during a committee investigation of price fixing and price gouging allegations involving cement sales to the state.

Calif Judge Says Enron Must Comply With Document Subpoena

08/29/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Sacramento Superior Court judge issued a tentative ruling Wednesday that Enron Corp. (ENE) must comply with a subpoena of financial documents by a state Senate committee investigating electricity market manipulation, according to court records. 
Enron argued that the subpoena should be void because the company is headquartered out-of-state in Houston. The judge said, however, that a company's residence wasn't a relevant issue for legislative subpoenas.
The judge also denied a request by Enron for a protective order for documents it provides the committee. He said he was "sympathetic" to Enron's concern for safeguarding its trade secret information, but that issuing a protective order would constitute an unacceptable intrusion into the Legislature's activities. The judge will hear arguments Thursday. 
Enron said it would be happy to comply with the committee's subpoena as long as it receives a protective order. The company intends to argue that it should be granted the order because a San Francisco Superior Court judge granted one Wednesday in a separate investigation by the state attorney general, company spokesman Mark Palmer said. 
"The San Francisco judge said we must have a protective order agreed on by both Enron and the attorney general's office, and we will use that to argue for one in the Senate committee investigation as well," Palmer said. 
The committee has already cited Enron and Reliant Energy Corp. (REI) with contempt for refusing to provide documents, a charge for which the companies could be fined. 
The chairman of the Senate Select Committee To Investigate Market Manipulation said his panel was happy about the Sacramento court's ruling. 
"We are pleased the court upheld the constitutional right of the Senate to proceed with an investigation directed at a legitimate legislative purpose," said Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana. "We intend to aggressively pursue the investigation." 
The price manipulation committee's next meeting will be in early September. The panel will continue to hold hearings beyond the Legislature's Sept. 14 adjournment date, Dunn has said.

Azurix, Enron Settle Holder Suit Over $275 Mln Buyback Offer

     Wilmington, Delaware, Aug. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Shareholders of
Azurix Corp., a wastewater services management company, settled a
lawsuit over parent Enron Corp.'s $275 million stock buyback offer
last year.

     Houston, Texas-based Enron, the No. 1 energy trader, said in
October 2000 it would pay $7 for each of Azurix's outstanding
shares to take the unit private. In seven lawsuits filed in
Delaware Chancery Court in Wilmington, stock owners said the
shares were worth more.

     After negotiations among lawyers, Enron agreed to increase
the price to $8.375 per share, adding $52.5 million. The
transaction was completed in March for $327.5 million.
     Shareholders said in court papers they decided to settle the
consolidated lawsuit because accepting the added price per share
was ``in the best interests'' of stockholders.

     The agreement requires approval by a judge at a Nov. 16
hearing. Shareholders' lawyers say they'll seek $2.25 million in
legal fees and expenses.

     Enron took Houston-based Azurix public in June 1999 at $19
per share. It decided to buy back the stock because Azurix was
having trouble with plans to win large water contracts and buy
rivals, and the share value had fallen more than 80 percent.

     Three weeks ago, Voorhees, New Jersey-based American Water
Works Inc., the No. 1 publicly traded U.S. water utility, said it
would buy the Azurix North America unit for $149.8 million in cash
and debt. Enron said other Azurix assets also will be sold.

     Shares of Enron, which reported $100.7 billion in fiscal 2000
sales, fell 86 cents to $37.30.

'Blackout' is a FRONTLINE co-production with The New York Times 
BOSTON, June 1 /PRNewswire/ -- FRONTLINE and The New York Times join forces 
to investigate the story behind the California energy crisis in "Blackout," a 
new documentary airing Tuesday, June 5, at 10 P.M. on PBS (check local 
listings). Through interviews with utility executives, industry insiders, and 
state and federal officials, the one-hour documentary examines how profits of 
both power companies and energy-trading giants have soared amid a 
deregulation process that has produced blackouts and rate hikes for 
consumers. The program also explores why the federal government refused for 
months to intervene in the California crisis, as well as the rationale for 
dismantling the old system of utility regulation.
"Blackout" examines the importance of a new kind of megacorporation: giant, 
national holding companies that trade electricity and gas much like any other 
commodity. With names like Enron, Dynegy, Reliant, and El Paso -- and with 
close ties to high-ranking Republican and Democratic officials -- these 
energy traders have seen their profits explode in recent years even as 
consumers endured power shortages and rate hikes. 
FRONTLINE and The New York Times interview key figures on both sides of the 
energy debate, including Vice President Dick Cheney, California Governor Gray 
Davis, Enron CEO Jeff Skilling, and Curt Hebert, chairman of the Federal 
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). State utility executives and citizens' 
advocates, who charge that California's deregulation fell prey to market 
manipulation, are also interviewed. 
Following the broadcast, viewers can learn more about the energy crisis by 
logging on to FRONTLINE's companion "Blackout" Web site -- 
http://www.pbs.org/frontline/shows/blackout. In addition to articles and in- 
depth interviews on the power crunch, the site will feature graphs and 
timelines illustrating the origins of the California crisis, America's 
historical and projected power usage, and the profits of the major power 
companies and energy-trading giants. The site also will offer an analysis of 
the Bush administration's energy plan.

Energy wholesalers on PG&E committee accused of conflict
By KAREN GAUDETTE

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Two of the same energy wholesalers accused of driving 
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy with high power prices asked a 
federal bankruptcy judge Friday to let them keep selling electricity to the 
utility. 
Critics say that could result in higher bills for ratepayers and less money 
for the rest of PG&E's creditors to share, if the wholesalers' high prices 
keep whittling away at the utility's remaining money.
"We certainly don't believe they should get a safe harbor order so that they 
can do what they've done in the past," said Irving Sulmeyer, an attorney 
representing the city and county of San Francisco. 
Houston-based Enron Corp. and Dynegy Inc., like other power wholesalers, have 
denied gouging Californians on the price they pay for power. 
On Friday, the two companies asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali to 
let them keep selling electricity to PG&E's customers via the state 
Department of Water Resources, which has bought electricity on PG&E's behalf 
since January. 
Dynegy and Enron sit on the 11-member creditors committee that will play a 
huge role in how PG&E's fortunes are divided among the more than 50,000 
banks, energy companies and cities to whom the utility owes money. 
The "safe harbor" would shield them from conflict of interest accusations. 
The committee members would be honor-bound not to share information with any 
branches of their companies able to profit from it. 
"They want to be absolved in advance," Sulmeyer said. "What are they so 
concerned about if they're not doing anything wrong?" 
Robert Moore, an attorney representing the voluntary creditors committee, 
said other committee members such as Bank of America and Merrill Lynch also 
are requesting safe harbors so they can continue trading stock and remain 
members. 
"At least four members of the committee would have to resign without it," 
Moore told the judge. 
Montali asked each committee member to file a declaration with the court 
requesting to trade either commodities (electricity) or securities (stock), 
and scheduled another hearing on the issue for June 12.

CANADA: Delays could unplug Enron's Ontario power plans.
By Scott Anderson

06/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

TORONTO, June 1 (Reuters) - A planned C$200 million ($130 million) power 
plant for southwestern Ontario may be in jeopardy if the provincial 
government continues to drag its feet on deregulating the province's 
electricity market, the head of Enron Corp.'s Canadian unit said on Friday. 
Enron, the Texas-based energy firm, is slated to build the 400-megawatt Moore 
project near Sarnia, Ontario. But construction of the plant is contingent on 
the government's date for opening the market to competition and time may be 
running out, Ron Milnthorp, president of Enron Canada, told Reuters in a 
telephone interview from Calgary.
"I think we are really looking for a fall date as an optimum time for us to 
align our interests with Ontario," Milnthorp said. 
"If it's put off until spring, I do believe that the project is somewhat in 
jeopardy and would need to be assessed from an operational standpoint against 
all other opportunities that Enron has on its plate." 
Ontario said in April that deregulation would be brought into effect by the 
late spring of 2002, but was accused of raising market uncertainty by not 
setting a specific target date. 
The government may have a better idea of its timetable in September, after a 
key study by the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO) and the 
Ontario Energy Board (OEB) is finalized. The two have set up a joint task 
force to prepare for an open the wholesale and retail electricity market. 
Milnthorp said Enron still holds out hope the province will give a target 
date soon after the September study is released. 
"The problem is date certainty. The way things are structured, they have a 
conditional announcement," he said. "We would really like to have a date so 
that we can start investing further capital in that project." 
Although Milnthorp said Enron is "still committed to Ontario," he said the 
company will not invest any further until there is greater certainty. 
"We're on hold at this point," he said. "You can't conditionally invest 
capital. Capital investment is unconditional and we're looking for a date 
that is unconditional also, and I think that is consistent with Enron and 
other outside investors who are going to have the same opinion." 
The company needs about six to 12 months to build the new plant, he said. The 
turbines and most of the required permits are already in place. 
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, has already pushed back its 
original deregulation deadline of November 2000 by one year to try to avoid 
the kind of problems encountered in California and to a lesser extent in 
Alberta. 
California's electricity deregulation has been plagued by skyrocketing costs, 
bankruptcy and rolling blackouts as power demand has increased dramatically, 
while little new generating capacity has been added in the past 10 years. 
In Alberta, consumers have been hit with a series of cost increases as the 
province deregulates its power sector. 
Enron officials say Ontario should not be viewed in the same light as 
California or Alberta. While California's concerns are purely one of supply 
and demand, Ontario already has adequate generating facilities to fuel the 
needs of the province. 
"There are significant differences between Ontario and California and there 
is absolutely no expectation that the scenario that is unfolding in 
California now will unfold in Ontario," said Aleck Dadson, senior director of 
governmental affairs at Enron.

USA: NewPower sees savings from smart energy technology.

06/01/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - NewPower Holdings Inc. said it will conduct 
three pilot programs in Philadelphia to test consumers' reaction to "smart" 
energy saving technology. 
With the restructuring of the electricity industry, energy companies expect 
to offer customers new products and services designed to save money and 
conserve energy.
These new products, however, require "smart" meters that tell "smart" device 
to operate when the cost of generating electricity is cheapest. 
Some of these "smart" meters and devices are now available to large 
commercial and industrial consumers but, for the most part, are either too 
expensive or in the development stage for the average homeowner, pending 
testing in pilot programs like the NewPower program. 
"Energy restructuring leads to technological innovation, efficiency and 
environmental benefits," said H. Eugene Lockhart, The New Power Co.'s 
president and chief executive officer. 
Almost all utilities still sell power to residential customers at flat rates 
throughout the day regardless of what that power costs in the wholesale 
market. 
"These pilots are a wonderful example of control being shifted from the 
utility to the consumer. The nation's move to energy restructuring makes it 
possible for consumers to better manage their energy needs," Lockhart said. 
THE PILOT PROGRAMS 
The three pilots consisting of 100 households each will include: a 
time-of-use metering pilot; an HVAC (heating, ventilation and air 
conditioning) load control pilot, and an interactive pilot allowing consumers 
to remotely access their thermostat from any Internet-enabled device. 
New Power said it will install meters in consumers homes in the time-of-use 
metering program. the meters record daily energy use and will enable NewPower 
to better understand typical energy consumption patterns. 
In the HVAC load control pilot, NewPower will install air conditioning 
programmable thermostats in 100 homes to gauge customers' reaction to having 
NewPower remotely alter their thermostat setting by 2 to 6 degrees to help 
the homeowner better manage their energy usage and costs. 
In the remote energy management system pilot, consumers can change their 
thermostat setting from any Internet-accessible device. However, unlike the 
HVAC load control pilot, NewPower said the customer always remains in control 
and may override the adjustment at any time from the Web or a wireless 
device. 
The pilot programs will run from early June to the end of September - the 
peak season for energy consumption when air conditioning pushes electric 
demand to annual peaks. 
NewPower Holdings, based in Purchase, N.Y., through its subsidiary The New 
Power Co., is the first national provider of electricity and natural gas to 
residential and small commercial customers in the U.S.

California Lawmakers Weigh Plan to Let Business Shoulder Burden of Utility 
Rescue
By Jason Leopold

06/01/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- Lawmakers in California are mulling yet another set of ideas 
for rescuing embattled utility Southern California Edison, and this time 
businesses would be on the hook.
In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied 
efforts to restore the Edison International (EIX) unit to solvency, 
legislators are now considering ways to shift the burden of financing the 
rescue from residential ratepayers to the state's largest businesses, aides 
to key state lawmakers said this week. 
The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly 
Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape 
as formal proposals. But an aide to Mr. Burton said some key lawmakers are so 
"desperate" to keep Southern California Edison from following PG&E Corp. 
(PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric Co. into a bankruptcy filing that they are 
willing to consider anything that will take residential consumers out of the 
equation. 
"The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for 
deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing 
out Edison," the aide said. "We're looking to take the burden off of 
residential ratepayers." 
The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers Thursday is to designate 
Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as non-core 
customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 
kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of 
power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale 
market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its 
$5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. 
Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market 
as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate 
themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. 
The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as 
alternatives to a memorandum of understanding California Gray Davis struck 
with Edison in April. The pact -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement 
in principle reached in February - - has been called dead on arrival by some 
lawmakers, who have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the 
agreement forward. 
Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the 
Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that 
could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. 
"This (plan) would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got 
hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our 
businesses to other states." 
Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks 
to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California 
Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its 
residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Mr. 
Burton and Mr. Hertzberg said. 
An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to 
Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial 
customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has 
recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the 
California Chamber of Commerce. 
Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with 
companies like Enron for their power. 
Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was 
scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in 
place of the utilities.

Williams CEO fears bankruptcies in California

Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

TULSA, Okla. (AP) - Allegations of price fixing are locking energy suppliers 
out of efforts to solve California's power squeeze, the head of a Tulsa-based 
energy provider says. 
"We have been demonized to the point that we are not a credible voice 
politically," said Keith Bailey, chairman, president and chief executive 
officer of Williams.
California energy regulators say they are close to finishing probes into 
whether electricity wholesalers illegally manipulated the power market, 
driving up prices. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier this year alleged that 
Williams profited from the closure of two Southern California power plants 
owned by a business partner, Arlington, Va.-based AES Corp. 
Williams admitted no wrongdoing but refunded $8 million to settle the 
charges. 
California's inv-estigations are examining the conduct of Williams, as well 
as that of other wholesalers, including Houston-based Enron Corp., Dynegy 
Inc., and Reliant Energy, Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy and Atlanta-based 
Mirant Corp. 
Bailey said California owes Williams more than $600 million for electricity 
sold to the state. 
He said California lawmakers must act soon if they want to keep the state's 
struggling electric utilities from going bankrupt. Bailey said the matter 
could be assigned to a bankruptcy judge if lawmakers fail to establish a plan 
to restore the financial health of those utilities. 
Williams supports short-term price controls to get the utilities back on 
track. The company also supports Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to pass legislation 
that would help Southern California Edison, the state's second-largest power 
provider, pay its debts. 
California's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, rejected a similar deal 
and filed for bankruptcy protection.

Saudi Gas Ventures May Offer Promise, Small Returns (Update1)
2001-06-01 14:26 (New York)

Saudi Gas Ventures May Offer Promise, Small Returns (Update1)


     (Updates first, second paragraphs to reflect that Enron quit
the project. Adds quote in 18th paragraph.)

     London, June 1 (Bloomberg) -- Exxon Mobil Corp., BP Plc,
Royal Dutch/Shell Group and four other energy companies are set to
spend $25 billion on Saudi Arabian natural gas ventures that some
analysts say may barely meet managements' profit targets.
     Along with Total Fina Elf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum
Co. and Occidental Petroleum Corp., the partners are scheduled to
sign agreements this weekend for the three projects. Their annual
return on investment may at best be 15 percent, a level some
companies call the minimum to justify spending, analysts said.
     ``Fifteen percent might be a limit,'' said Jon Wright, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch & Co. ``But maybe they are taking the
view that, `We need to be here, we have to be here and it's a
major, important area.'''
     Flush with cash -- Exxon, Shell and BP alone posted net
income of $41.5 billion last year -- oil companies are seeking the
best ways to meet annual growth in energy demand while maximizing
profits. Saudi Arabia has said those who help now will likely get
first crack at the nation's oil fields, the world's largest,
should they open to foreigners.
     Executives from the seven partners are scheduled to sign the
agreements Sunday in the Red Sea coast city of Jeddah, ending
years of talks and marking the return of Western oil companies to
the kingdom for the first time in two decades. Financial terms of
the ventures are to be negotiated later this year.
     ``It's unlikely to contribute to the bottom line in the short
term,'' said Roger Richards, who helps manage more than 3 billion
pounds ($4.26 billion) in the U.K. for Prudential Bache Ltd.
clients. Still, ``it's important to the majors to be in such an
important gas province when it's potentially the door to getting
back into Saudi oil.''

                           Further Talks

     Development of gas fields to fuel power plants and water
desalination factories is part of Saudi Arabia's plan to convert
its power industry from running on oil to gas. The nation wants to
free more crude oil for export and provide jobs for the estimated
15 percent of the population who are unemployed.
     Many analysts said the return on investment will barely match
the companies' targets -- in Shell's case, 15 percent return based
on oil prices at less than half of today's levels.
     U.S. brokerage Fahnestock & Co. estimates returns from the
Saudi projects at 10 percent to 15 percent. Deep-water oil and gas
drilling can pay back 40 percent a year, said J.J. Traynor, an
analyst at Deutsche Bank AG in Edinburgh, Scotland.
     ``The line in the sand for the major oils is a 15 percent
return -- they won't go below that,'' Traynor said. ``In the long
term, maybe oil becomes available. That's 10 or 20 years away, but
you have to be there now.''
     Lee Raymond, Exxon's chairman and chief executive, has said
he expects returns from the Saudi ventures in the ``mid to high
teens.'' That's lower than the 20.6 percent return on capital
Exxon posted last year and rival BP's 23 percent return, when
adjusted for special items.


                         Little Risk

     The benefits of going into Saudi are twofold, analysts said.
Firstly, the winners will have a lead should the country open
access to its crude oil reserves.
     Secondly, the projects carry little risk compared to
exploratory drilling that can cost millions for nothing more than
a hole in the ground. Much of the Saudi reserves are already
mapped, and the government understands it needs Western capital
and expertise.
     ``It's in the Saudis' interests to get Western oil companies
involved again,'' said Will Claxton-Smith, director of U.K.
equities at Clerical Medical Investment Group Ltd., which owns BP
and Shell shares. ``You wouldn't want them to be left out.''
     The kingdom has not yet named the leaders of the $17 billion
South Ghawar gas project, the centerpiece of its plan, or the $4
billion Shaybah field.
     Companies selected for these two developments include Exxon,
Shell, BP, Phillips, Conoco and Total. Saudi Arabia picked Exxon
to lead the estimated $4 billion Red Sea gas development project,
with Occidental and Enron Corp. as junior partners.

                            Enron Quits

     Enron today withdrew from the venture, leaving partner
Occidental to absorb its role, Enron spokesman Alex Parsons said.
He declined to say why Enron pulled out. The company has been
moving away from large infrastructure projects to focus on trading
natural gas, electricity and other commodities.
     ``If we have a continued association with this project, it
will be to provide services under a separate contract directly
with Occidental,'' Parsons said.
     Once the ink dries this weekend, financial negotiations
between the kingdom and the companies should take months, analysts
said.
     ``The companies are keen to get their foot through the door
but they're not going to throw shareholders' money away,'' said
Leo Drollas, deputy executive director of the Centre for Global
Energy Studies, which was founded by former Saudi oil minister
Sheikh Zaki Yamani. ``They are not philanthropic institutions. If
they're not happy, they won't do it.''

Democrats Prepare to Duel Bush Over Energy Price Caps in West

WASHINGTON -- If you talk to economists, many will say President Bush is on 
solid ground in opposing caps on soaring electricity prices in California and 
elsewhere. But if you talk to voters, many will suggest he has political 
problems. 
And now that Democrats control the U.S. Senate, they are poised to make those 
problems a lot worse.
Mr. Bush got a taste of what is coming in his widely touted showdown with 
California Gov. Gray Davis in Los Angeles this week. The Republican president 
repeated his familiar argument that capping wholesale electricity prices 
would do nothing to curb demand or increase the supply of power for 
California. But the Democrats' Mr. Davis, fortified by polls showing that 70% 
of Californians favor price caps, managed to get equal billing during Mr. 
Bush's visit for his argument that they are needed to keep the state from 
slipping into recession and threatening the national economy in the process. 
Because Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont left the Republican Party last week and 
changed control of the Senate, Democrats now have a more effective national 
platform to press the same arguments -- and to threaten Mr. Bush's political 
standing beyond the already hostile turf of California. The incoming chairman 
of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Democratic Sen. Jeff 
Bingaman of New Mexico, says he plans to move soon on legislation capping 
prices for California and other Western states, a bill that has attracted 
some GOP support as well. 
"I think it's clear to anybody that the prices being charged for wholesale 
power are excessive," said Sen. Bingaman, in an interview while he was 
heading toward California on a fact-finding mission. "I don't believe it's 
going to be adequate to get us through this summer, to just continue saying 
that eventually supply will come into line with demand and the problems will 
be resolved." 
Meantime, the incoming chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on 
Investigations, Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan, plans to investigate 
the role of oil companies in higher gas prices. "This is the manipulation of 
prices, and we've got to investigate it because our people in Michigan are 
absolutely furious," Sen. Levin says. Just as Republicans once used the 
machinery of Congress to probe then-President Clinton's problems, Democrats 
see ripe opportunities for embarrassing an ex-oilman president with strong 
links to Texas energy-producing companies that are profiting from today's 
supply squeeze. 
During the 2000 presidential campaign, five of the major companies now 
supplying power to California -- Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Enron Corp., 
Reliant Energy Inc., and Williams Cos. -- gave some $3.6 million to Mr. Bush 
and the GOP, more than triple the amount donated to Democrats. Three of those 
companies are based in Mr. Bush's home state of Texas, which only adds to the 
political tensions. 
The Democratic offensive has the GOP worried. Price caps amount to "terrible 
policy, but good politics," frets Republican pollster Neil Newhouse. Mr. Bush 
now faces "a difficult job" overcoming the Democratic arguments for caps, he 
adds, because "control of the Senate has given them a megaphone on issues 
that they just didn't have before." 
That doesn't necessarily mean Mr. Bush ultimately will suffer grave damage. 
As congressional Republicans learned to their chagrin in battles with Mr. 
Clinton, the presidential bully pulpit remains the most potent weapon in 
American politics for framing policy debates. Even with that advantage, 
though, the Clinton administration found that the initial appeal of arguments 
on issues such as tobacco regulation and prescription drugs faded under 
sustained counterattack by Republicans and affected industries. 
And so far, polls are showing that Mr. Davis also is paying a political price 
in California for the crisis. Still, Mr. Davis, who faces re-election next 
year and may later seek the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination, believes 
he can limit the damage by emphasizing his efforts to expand supply and 
spotlighting the actions of energy companies in Texas and elsewhere. On CNN's 
"Larry King Live" this week, he complained that "money sucked out of this 
state" amounts to "a massive transfer of wealth" from Californians to the 
industry. 
Whatever the political ramifications, they aren't limited to California. 
Consumers in Washington, Idaho and Montana that are serviced by the same 
electric grid have seen 30% increases in their utility rates. That is why Mr. 
Davis, with support from some GOP governors in the West, is asking the 
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose short-term wholesale price 
caps to help protect electricity consumers from soaring rates until new power 
plants approved for construction in California increase supply enough to 
bring prices down through market forces. California Democratic Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein and Oregon Republican Sen. Gordon Smith are offering legislation to 
accomplish that in the committee that Mr. Bingaman now will chair. 
As a matter of policy, most economists probably would agree with Mr. Bush's 
free-market position on price caps, though that sentiment is hardly 
unanimous. As he met with the president this week, Mr. Davis released a 
letter from 10 prominent economists backing price caps as a temporary remedy 
for a market "not characterized by effective competition." One of the 
signatories was Alfred Kahn, architect of airline deregulation under 
President Carter. 
But Bush economic advisers, heeding the free-market arguments that have held 
the high ground in regulatory policy debates since the Reagan era, insist 
that such caps would distort the energy market and be difficult to abandon 
even when market conditions turn more favorable for consumers. "Price caps do 
nothing to reduce demand, and they do nothing to increase supply," Mr. Bush 
said in California this week. 
Mr. Davis says the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is obliged under law 
to assure "just and reasonable" prices, and he says he will sue the agency to 
force it to act despite the dismissal earlier this week of a similar lawsuit 
filed by California's Democratic legislative leaders. Whether the governor's 
effort succeeds, it could provide another forum in which supporters of price 
caps can make their case. In discovery, for instance, California attorneys 
may be able to get industry data on how much the wholesalers are paying to 
produce electricity and their real costs of delivering it. 
Such transactions are drawing attention because of the significantly higher 
prices being charged in California compared with other states. This week, for 
instance, the price of a million British Thermal Units of natural gas in the 
San Juan Basin in New Mexico was $2.80, said one economist for the Senate 
Energy Committee. But when that gas arrived at the Southern California 
border, she said, the price was $10.20 per million BTUs. 
Mr. Bush himself voiced concern about such differentials in his meeting with 
Mr. Davis, and ordered the FERC to step up monitoring for price gouging. He 
has designated Pat Wood, a recent FERC appointee who headed the Texas Public 
Utilities Commission during his governorship, as the administration's lead 
liaison to California. 
Mr. Wood, in fact, could end up an increasingly important player as the 
crisis in California and other Western states plays out this summer. Mr. 
Wood, who supported some price caps in Texas, is considered more flexible on 
the issue than is FERC's current chairman, free-market champion Curtis 
Hebert. During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Wood said it may be too late 
for price caps because the commission would need months to study materials 
and determine an appropriate market rate. 
If the administration continues resisting caps, Democrats vow to score 
political points heading into the 2002 congressional elections. "Bush is the 
individual who ginned this up into a crisis" by frequently calling attention 
to the nation's energy problems, says Jim Jordan, executive director of the 
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. "Yet the administration won't 
consider any serious short-term action to alleviate the problem for the 
public."

California; Metro Desk
Electricity Trading Is Target of State Probe Regulation: A special Senate 
panel is investigating alleged price manipulation of power transactions.

TIMES STAFF WRITERS

California officials are probing a vast private network of electricity 
trading floors suspected of being a central culprit in California's spiraling 
energy prices. 
A special state Senate panel investigating alleged manipulation of the energy 
market is zeroing in on hundreds of thousands of secretive transactions each 
year that help determine whether California will have the power it needs--and 
what it will have to pay to get it. Those activities also are central to a 
lawsuit by the San Francisco city attorney, who has accused power companies 
of using unfair business practices to reap huge profits from the state's 
volatile and vulnerable energy market.
A single electron may be traded nearly a dozen times, often at escalating 
prices, before reaching California. By then, the actual cost of producing the 
electricity may have no relation to its price. 
Unlike other commodity and stock exchanges, the frenzied daily activity on 
the energy trading floors escape any independent oversight, which critics 
contend makes the operations ripe for collusion and price-fixing. 
"They're playing the California power game," said attorney Michael Aguirre, a 
former federal prosecutor now suing power companies on behalf of Lt. Gov. 
Cruz Bustamante. "The trading is the epicenter of the whole enchilada. They 
trade and inflate the value." 
Power company representatives say their trading floors operate legally and 
ethically. "I don't think there has ever been the slightest shred of evidence 
[of] something illicit or wrongdoing," said Gary Ackerman of the Western 
Power Trading Forum, an industry trade group. 
Ackerman and players in the market say prices are not always ratcheted up 
through the trading. Often, they say, traders can match supply and demand to 
help stabilize prices through daily transactions and long-term contracts. 
Still, Aguirre and others say, these sophisticated trading operations have 
outmaneuvered bureaucrats at Cal-ISO and the state Department of Water 
Resources, the agencies responsible for buying billions of dollars worth of 
power over the past several months. 
The sprawling trading floors, scattered across the country, are marvels of 
high technology. Amid banks of computers and huge wall screens that track 
weather, electricity prices and demand across vast regions, mathematicians, 
meteorologists and rows of gung-ho traders try to optimize profits buying and 
selling one of the world's most volatile commodities. 
"These are trading floors that are well outside any regulatory format," state 
Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana) said Thursday. "What impact do these trading 
floors have on the situation in California?" 
Plant Operations Also Scrutinized 
Although trading floors are an important focus of state authorities, the 
probes of the power companies include an array of issues. Investigators are 
digging into the operations of power plants to determine whether unnecessary 
shutdowns have been used to tighten supplies and hike prices. Dunn, a onetime 
consumer attorney, is heading the Senate investigation panel that is trying 
to unravel these issues and the role of the trading floors, operated by the 
nation's largest power marketers: Enron, Mirant, Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., 
Williams Cos. and Reliant. 
The committee is seeking records that could determine whether the power 
companies have swapped information on trading tactics to maximize prices. 
Among dozens of categories of documents Dunn's committee has requested--and 
may ultimately subpoena--are computer records from trading floors, recordings 
of communications between traders for different companies and training 
manuals for traders. 
"We know one product of that trading is it drives up the price. . . . What 
are you trading for, other than to drive up the price?" Dunn said in a recent 
interview. 
His committee, which has yet to uncover any wrongdoing, is battling with the 
power companies to obtain information the firms insist is confidential. 
San Francisco City Atty. Louise H. Renne also is focusing on trading-floor 
activity. 
"That is a central concern of ours," said Owen Clements, Renne's chief of 
special litigation. Clements suspects power traders may be "churning" 
megawatts through repeated sales and boosting prices. 
"If everyone passes it around and makes a profit, and the ratepayer and the 
state of California are stuck with the bill . . . that certainly looks like 
an unfair business practice," he said. 
A spokesman for Houston-based Enron, which operates one of the busiest 
trading operations, said critics misunderstand the energy market, where 
profits are not necessarily tied to high prices. 
"We're agnostic about the direction of prices," Mark Palmer said. "We make 
money one way or the other." He said the trick is in having a diversified 
portfolio--and offering unique risk services--to absorb the changing market. 
Palmer said those implying misconduct on the trading floors are "100% 
politically motivated. . . . These are folks who want to return California to 
[power] regulation." 
Still, some industry officials acknowledge that some additional oversight of 
trading floors may be needed. Ackerman, of the power trading association, 
said his members have asked federal regulators to consider an auditing 
program to review trading activities. 
"If people don't have confidence in trading floors," Ackerman said, "that's a 
problem."

World Stock Markets
Companies Rush to Purchase Their Indian Units, Boosting Share Prices of 
Concerns With Foreign Ties
By Jesse Pesta

NEW DELHI -- Foreign companies are on a shopping spree in India's stock 
market, buying up their own affiliates and hoping to take them private. 
In recent weeks, companies ranging from Otis Elevator Co. and Carrier Corp., 
both of Farmington, Conn., to Hoganas AB of Sweden, a player in the global 
iron-powder business, have made open offers for the shares of their Indian 
units, sometimes at prices that suggest they consider themselves a bargain. 
Boston chemicals maker Cabot Corp. offered 100 rupees ($2.13) a share for 
Cabot India Ltd. at a time when it was trading around 55 rupees.
Royal Philips Holland has offered to buy the 17% of light-bulb maker Punjab 
Anand Lamp Industries it doesn't already own, according to Punjab. Otis and 
Carrier, which are units of United Technologies Corp., Hartford, Conn., have 
offered to buy all shares outstanding of their Indian affiliates, Otis 
Elevator Co. (India) Ltd. and Carrier Aircon Ltd. The price for Carrier 
shares was a nearly 100% premium to the stock's price prior to the offer. 
The buybacks have triggered a surge in the stocks of other companies with a 
foreign pedigree. Companies including Rayban Sun Optics India Ltd. (a unit of 
Bausch & Lomb Inc., Rochester, N.Y.) and Philips India Ltd. (a unit of Royal 
Philips Holland) have seen share prices rise as much as 40% or more since the 
mid-May offers for Otis and Carrier, which were two of the early ones in the 
current wave. 
Both Rayban and Philips India deny open offers are planned. In any case, 
Philips already boosted ownership in its Philips India unit to 83% from 51% 
late last year. 
In contrast to the surging shares of multinationals since mid-May, the Bombay 
Sensitive Index has risen only 1.56%. It closed yesterday at 3631.91, down 
30.13. 
The trend has several drivers. For one thing, Indian stocks remain battered 
after a rash of big market scandals earlier this year. Meantime, taking a 
company private means it no longer is required to share as much information 
about its business either with the market or a local partner. "In tough times 
it will safeguard your interest," says Jignesh Shah, strategist at Ask-RJ 
Investment Management in Bombay. 
But most significantly, India has slowly made it easier in recent years for 
foreigners to invest. Indeed, the buyback trend contrasts with the feud 
between Dabhol Power Co. and its customer, the Maharashtra State Electricity 
Board, over unpaid electricity bills. Dabhol, which is 65%-owned by Houston's 
Enron Corp., is India's largest foreign investment and an emblem of the 
difficulties foreign companies have encountered through the years. But the 
buyback trend "works against the story of negative foreign-investment 
environment" in India, one analyst notes. 
As a rule, the companies play down the importance of stock price. Hoganas's 
buyback for instance reflects the company's global strategy, but reflects as 
well on a liberalizing India: Everywhere else in the world Hoganas owns 100% 
of its subsidiaries, even Japan and China, says Virendra Sud, managing 
director. But India didn't allow full foreign ownership 15 years ago, when 
the company came here, he says, or else "we would have done it then." It's 
purely coincidental that the buyback comes just as the stock market "has sort 
of hit rock bottom," he says. 
Otis attributes its buyback partly to India's growing appetite for more 
sophisticated elevators, which means transferring advanced designs here. 
Technology transfer heightens the need for closer cooperation with the 
parent, says Managing Director Ashok Malhotra. But the company's reason for 
going public in the first place sheds light on the regulatory cycle playing 
out today in India. In the 1970s, India went through a phase of requiring 
foreign companies to be part locally owned, so Otis made the public offer 
that it is trying to undo today. "You have to work under the rules of the 
time," Mr. Malhotra says.

International
Exxon, Shell Poised to Win Saudi Deals --- They Appear Favored To Lead Key 
Projects In Coveted Gas Sector
By Bhushan Bahree
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

06/01/2001
The Wall Street Journal

PARIS -- Exxon Mobil Corp. and the Royal Dutch/Shell Group appear poised to 
win coveted leadership roles this weekend in a historic reopening of Saudi 
Arabia's energy industry. 
People familiar with developments said that barring last-minute upsets, 
Exxon, the world's largest publicly owned oil company, will be named operator 
of the largest opening being offered by the Saudis, the South Ghawar 
natural-gas project that will require investment of $15 billion and is named 
after the world's largest oil field, in the country's eastern province. But, 
they cautioned, because Shell has been competing hotly for South Ghawar, 
nothing can be taken for granted until the Saudis officially name the winners 
and sign memorandums of understanding on Sunday.
As of late last night, Shell, the second largest company, was expected to win 
the second prize: leadership of the Shaybah gas project, which requires 
investment of $5 billion and is named after a recently developed oil field in 
the kingdom's remote Empty Quarter, a southeastern desert region. Saudi 
Arabia already has named Exxon leader of the third and last gas project 
opened to foreign investment, the Red Sea project that requires investment of 
as much as $5 billion. 
Saudi Arabia's energy industry was nationalized in the 1970s, but over the 
past two years has been reopened to foreign investment, prompting a fierce 
contest among the world's largest oil companies. The people familiar with 
developments cautioned that until the choices have been endorsed by an 
11-member ministerial committee headed by Saudi foreign minister Prince Saud 
al-Faisal, and given the final nod by Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah, they 
couldn't be considered final. 
The people said the ministerial committee met late yesterday ahead of a 
formal signing ceremony planned for Sunday in Jeddah, the Saudi city on the 
Red Sea coast. Such is the importance of getting into Saudi Arabia that the 
chief executives of the eight companies chosen to participate in the gas 
projects are flying to Jeddah to sign the memorandums, a prelude to 
negotiations about fiscal and other terms. Final agreements aren't expected 
until year's end at the earliest. 
Officials of Exxon, Shell and the Saudi government declined to comment on the 
choices made by the kingdom, which has the world's largest crude reserves and 
is fifth in the natural-gas reserves after Russia, Iran, Qatar and the United 
Arab Emirates. A leadership role -- or operatorship in industry parlance -- 
brings the opportunity to set the pace of the project and create local 
networks that can prove valuable for future projects. 
The kingdom still isn't allowing foreign companies into its crude-oil 
business, which is run by the state-owned Saudi Aramco, but foreign oil 
companies hope they eventually will be allowed into that sector, too. Indeed, 
Aramco is expected to participate in the gas projects opened to foreigners, 
with voting rights that have yet to be determined. The projects are 
wide-ranging and encompass a long chain from exploration and production of 
natural gas, to its transportation and use to generate electricity and in 
water desalination plants. 
Last month, Saudi Arabia named eight foreign companies, from a list of 11, to 
take part in three consortiums for these projects. Besides Exxon and Shell, 
they are BP PLC, TotalFinaElf SA, Conoco Inc., Phillips Petroleum Corp., 
Occidental Petroleum Corp. and Enron Corp. The three companies that sought 
but failed to get a place are Chevron Corp., ENI SpA, and Marathon Oil Canada 
Inc. 
Industry officials say the competition was some of the fiercest ever. Said a 
senior industry executive: "Everybody is looking 10 years down the road, and 
the place to be is in Saudi Arabia."

NEW PACKAGE TO RESOLVE DPC, INDIA'S MSEB SITUATION: OFFICIAL

06/01/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

NEW DELHI, Jun 1 Asia Pulse - A new package 'acceptable to all' is being 
evolved to resolve the seven-month old wrangle between Enron promoted Dabhol 
Power Company and the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) over the 
issue of cost of power and payment of bills, A V Gokak, the federal 
government's representative in Maharashtra's negotiation committee said 
today. 
"Things are moving in the right direction and government is serious to 
resolve the crisis," Gokak told PTI after a meeting with the Finance 
Minister, Yashwant Sinha, here.
Gokak said none of the parties to the dispute are in favour of closure of the 
$3 billion project. 
Earlier, the Indian government had asked Central Electricity Authority (CEA) 
to explore possibility of selling the DPC power to deficient states. But the 
Power Minister, Suresh Prabhu, had ruled out possibility of National Thermal 
Power Corporation (NTPC) lifting DPC power. 
Prabhu had stated that the government would make all efforts to settle the 
matter in consultation with the stake holders. 
Asked if any time frame has been set to break the impasse, Gokak said "delay 
is in nobody's interest, but there are no readymade solutions." 
The negotiating committee, headed by Madhav Godbole, has held two rounds of 
negotiations with the last round held earlier this week being termed 
"positive" by both DPC and the MSEB. 
Gokak is believed to have put forward alternative solutions in resolving the 
crisis.

		GLOBAL INVESTING: Betting on better times for utilities 
Financial Times; Jun 1, 2001
By JOHN DIZARD

		The share price of one large electron-pushing company is up nearly 70 per 
cent this year, but could be in line for another pop to the upside. 
		That may sound like a report from Mary Meeker, the formerly omniscient 
internet stock guru, or like your broker's stock-of-the-week pitch. 
		Well, neither will be making such a claim at the moment - their legal 
departments have them on too tight a leash. And the stock I have in mind is 
not a technology stock in the sense of a silicon basher or programmer farm. 
It is Edison International, the California electric power holding company, 
whose Southern California Edison utility has been very publicly hovering at 
the edge of bankruptcy for several months. 
		The day after President George W. Bush made his "You're on your own, 
California" speech, Edison's share price dropped more than 5 per cent. And 
while the year-to-date rise, from Dollars 6.25 to Dollars 10.50 this week, 
has been impressive, share-holders have seen a 46 per cent loss year on year. 
		So why should anyone be optimistic about the chances for the common 
shareholders in the holding company? Essentially because the state 
legislators are being terrified into coming up with a bail-out plan - not 
exactly the plan of Gray Davis, the governor of California, but one that will 
preserve some value for the holding company shareholders and give them a more 
predictable future. 
		By now every one knows that the California utilities were squeezed by fixed 
retail rates and rising wholesale costs. Edison has said it has Dollars 3.5bn 
in "undercollected" wholesale power purchase costs. The state of California 
(and its taxpayers) stepped in to buy power when the utilities ran out of 
borrowing capacity in January. PG&E, the other big investor-owned utility, 
filed for Chapter 11 protection back in April. Edison held off from filing, 
preferring to try to get a state government bail-out. 
		Much is missing from the standard account. For example, consumer groups 
believe there is a lot of padding in the "undercollect", and that the holding 
company should cough up billions in assets paid for with dividends supplied 
by the SCE subsidiary. Many of the California public believe that the 
merchant generators such as Duke Energy and Enron should pay back overcharges 
rather than get any back bills paid. 
		And yet the legislative tide is turning in Edison's favour. Within the next 
couple of weeks, I expect the Democrats - who control both the state Assembly 
and Senate - to come up with a bail-out plan for Edison that has a good 
chance of passing both houses and being signed into law by the governor. The 
reason is the the distinction they have begun to make between ratepayers and 
taxpayers. 
		To a legislator, tax payments, as distinct from utility rates, are things 
that run through their hands and go to favoured programmes. Taking over the 
payment of electric wholesale costs did not look too scary back in January, 
when Governor Davis said it would go on for a few weeks and be easily covered 
with the cash on hand. Well, the state has paid out nearly Dollars 8bn and 
its cash reserves will be under increasing pressure until a Dollars 
12bn-Dollars 13bn bond issue can be floated some time after August 15. A 
decline in tax receipts is putting even greater stress on the state 
government's resources. 
		So the legislators want to get as far out of the power business as they can, 
as fast as they can. That means saving Southern California Edison from 
Chapter 11. 
		The deal being negotiated within the Democratic leadership looks something 
like this. The state will make a large loan, call it Dollars 1bn, against the 
security of Edison's transmission system, to be repaid either through a sale 
of the system to the state or a deduction from the allowed return on the 
towers and wires. The holding company will pay out about Dollars 400m to prop 
up the subsidiary. The rest of the undercollect will be paid for by a 
"dedicated rate component", or charge to ratepayers - mostly commercial, 
industrial and large users - that cannot be revoked by the Public Utility 
Commission. The generators can get 70 cents on the dollar for their back 
bills right away, or they can litigate forever. 
		There are a few details that lawyers will quibble over, such as the 
constitutionality of retroactively raising rates. And some may ask if it is 
not cheaper just to let Edison go into Chapter 11, because even with the plan 
it will not be able to take the state's place as a wholesale buyer at any 
time soon. But I would bet on its passing anyway. And that would be good news 
for Edison International shareholders, since they will have held on to most 
of the holding company's assets, and still have an ongoing business in the 
subsidiary. 
		Don't bet the rent money on it, but it looks closer to me than a comeback in 
spending on semiconductors. Maybe the children's college money - if you lose 
it, they should work harder anyway.

		INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY, MIDDLE EAST & AFRICA: Hopefuls await details of Saudi 
gas deal Financial Times; Jun 1, 2001
By ROBIN ALLEN and MATTHEW JONES

		ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch/Shell are the favourites to lead two of Saudi 
Arabia's multi-billion dollar upstream gas projects to be opened to foreign 
companies, according to industry observers in the Middle East. 
		A committee of Saudi ministers responsible for the developments was due to 
meet late last night. The companies are expected to learn the size of their 
stakes either late today or early tomorrow, an official close to the projects 
said. 
		Saudi Arabia, which has excluded foreign companies in upstream operations 
since 1975, last month announced the selection of eight oil groups to 
participate in three gas projects requiring initial investment of around 
Dollars 25bn. 
		Exxon has already been appointed leader of Core Venture 2, on the Red Sea 
coast, which also includes Occidental Petroleum and Enron Corp of the US. The 
partners in Core Venture 3, the Shaybah development in the south-eastern 
quarter of the kingdom, are Shell, TotalFinaElf of France and Conoco of the 
US. 
		Analysts and industry experts in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi said Exxon was expected 
to be named leader of South Ghawar, also known as Core Venture 1, with a 35 
per cent stake. BP and Shell would each be awarded 25 per cent shares while 
Phillips would receive 15 per cent. 
		Exxon was expected to be given a 70 per cent share of Core Venture 2, with 
the remainder split equally between Occidental and Enron. Shell was tipped to 
lead Core Venture 3 with 40 per cent of the project, while Total and Conoco 
were expected to win 30 per cent each. 
		One analyst said there was an outside chance that BP would be awarded 
leadership of Core Venture 1 for political reasons. 
		A BP official last night said the group had had no indication of the 
decision, but added: "Even if we are not selected we will still have a very 
significant part in a huge project. The important thing is to be there."

FITCH PLACES INDIA ON NEGATIVE RATING OUTLOOK ON FISCAL CONCERNS

06/01/2001
Asia Pulse
(c) Copyright 2001 Asia Pulse PTE Ltd.

NEW DELHI, June 1 Asia Pulse - International ratings agency Fitch has changed 
the Rating Outlook on India's sovereign ratings from Stable to Negative, 
citing well-flagged concerns about fiscal policy, privatization and the 
deterioration in the foreign investment climate. 
Fitch currently rates the foreign and local currency obligations of India at 
BB+ and BBB- respectively.
The negative rating outlook reflects the slow progress of the government in 
implementing privatization and addressing the weaknesses in public finances. 
The fiscal-monetary policy mix in India remains unfavorable, resulting in 
relatively high real interest rates and crowding out of private sector 
investment. 
Until the authorities display a concerted willingness to address fiscal 
imbalances, India will remain locked in a stop-go cycle of growth and the 
sovereign could slip into a debt trap, Fitch said in a press statement. 
The recent corruption scandal, involving the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party 
(BJP)-led coalition government, threatens to exacerbate these trends and slow 
economic reform. 
India's general government fiscal deficit at over 9 per cent of GDP is among 
the highest in the realm of rated sovereigns. 
Persistently high fiscal deficits have led to a build-up of the general 
government's debt burden, estimated to be over 60 per cent of GDP. 
In addition, the government has guarantees outstanding amounting to 9 per 
cent of GDP. 
Fitch reiterates the point that such guarantees, issued to back mainly 
infrastructure projects, are contingent liabilities of the government. 
This has most recently been borne out in the case of Enron, where the US 
power company has invoked a central government guarantee for payment arrears 
accumulated by the Maharashtra State Electricity Board.

Some light at last!

The Economic Times

NEW Delhis intervention in the tussle between Enron and the Maharashtra 
government is a welcome development. The government wants the Central 
Electricity Authority to find out whether electricity generated by Dabhol 
Power Company can be sold to states which need power badly if it cant be used 
by Maharashtra.
This is a good idea India is seriously short of reliable, quality electricity 
supply. Maharashtra claims that it doesnt need even the 740 MW now generated 
by DPC at going rates. This creates further trouble: the lower Maharashtras 
offtake, the higher the unit price of DPC power. Once other power hungry 
states start buying up electricity from DPC, the price per kilowatt hour will 
fall sharply. 
The first step to getting DPC out of the hole that Enron, Maharashtra and 
successive Indian governments have dug it into, is to allow the utility to 
sell power to anyone who wants to purchase it at going rates. However, asking 
central utilities like the fledgling Power Trading Corporation to evacuate 
DPC power for sale outside Maharashtra wont solve the hassles of the sector 
for all time. 
The government should modify electricity laws to allow generating companies 
to sell electricity to all users immediately. An ordinance passed by New 
Delhi will do the trick power is a concurrent subject, with central 
legislation overriding states. 
But even if that happens, it is doubtful if there will be too many buyers for 
Dabhol power at its present price about Rs 4 per unit with the plant running 
at high capacities. If the price is to be brought down further, the deal with 
MSEB will have to be renegotiated. 
The Godbole Committee says that some financial restructuring, de-dollarising 
of debt and equity, and so on can bring prices down by about 30 per cent from 
DPCs minimum Rs 4 per unit rate today. 
Otherwise, as the GC points out, it will be impossible for the project to be 
viable at current tariffs. India desperately needs electricity to grow. For 
the power sector to grow, reforms are necessary at every level 
renegotiations, yes, but also changes in laws and the rules of the game.

Calif. investigations focus on whether out-of state wholesalers manipulated 
energy prices
By MICHAEL LIEDTKE
AP Business Writer

05/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - State energy regulators say they are close to finishing 
probes into whether electricity wholesalers illegally aggravated the state's 
power squeeze. 
In one year, California's power crisis has raised customer rates by $5.7 
billion and dumped a $13 billion bailout bill on taxpayers. State officials 
hope to recover the money if they find evidence that out-of-state wholesalers 
manipulated the market to illegally driving up prices.
The wholesalers say they are being turned into scapegoats for a 1996 
deregulation law sculpted by California lawmakers and the state's two largest 
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison. 
The utilities have reported a combined $8.2 billion in losses since June 
2000. 
Two legislative committees are investigating allegations that wholesalers 
created artificial supply shortages that drove wholesale electricity prices 
as high as $1,900 per megawatt hour. Before June 2000, wholesale prices for 
energy sold under similar terms rarely climbed above $150 per megawatt hour. 
At least five lawsuits, including one filed by San Francisco City Attorney 
Louise Renne, seek damages from wholesalers on behalf of all Californians. 
"I don't think these are going to be very hard cases to make," said Owen 
Clements, chief special litigator for San Francisco. "Even if they didn't 
break the letter of the law, they clearly have violated the spirit of the 
law." 
Attorney General Bill Lockyer is offering multimillion-dollar rewards to 
power plant workers and energy traders who provide the state with inside 
information about wholesaler's decisions. 
"Everyone feels like they're being ripped off. There's a lot of emotional 
belief that unfair things have been done, but we're still working through the 
case," said Lockyer, a Democrat who voted for the deregulation law when he 
served in the state Senate. 
The state utilities commission is inspecting power plant documents that may 
show whether some facilities shut down unnecessarily to diminish supply. The 
commission and Lockyer are investigating whether the plants then increased 
production to reap big profits. 
Power wholesalers maintain that the plants, many of which are 30 to 40 years 
old, shut down for legitimate equipment repairs and maintenance. 
"No one in our industry cuts back on production so a competitor can make more 
money. It just doesn't happen, at least not on planet Earth," said Gary 
Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a trade 
group. 
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier this year alleged that 
Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams profited from the closure of two Southern 
California power plants owned by a business partner, Arlington, Va.-based AES 
Corp. 
Without admitting wrongdoing, Williams refunded $8 million to settle the 
charges. 
California's investigations are examining the conduct of Williams, as well as 
several other prominent power wholesalers, including Houston-based Enron 
Corp., Dynegy Inc., and Reliant Energy, Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy and 
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. 
Cohen said the utilities commission could file a civil lawsuit against the 
wholesalers by the end of June. Lockyer expects to wrap up an investigation 
in late July at the earliest.

California Lawmakers Eye Billing Businesses for Edison Rescue
By Jason Leopold

05/31/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Newswires 
LOS ANGELES -- California lawmakers are mulling yet another set of ideas for 
rescuing embattled Southern California Edison, and this time businesses would 
be on the hook.
In an attempt to deflect charges of a bailout that have thus far stymied 
efforts to restore the utility to solvency, legislators are now considering 
ways to shift the burden of financing the rescue from residential ratepayers 
to the state's largest businesses, aides to key state lawmakers said this 
week. 
The ideas being worked over by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, Assembly 
Speaker Robert Hertzberg and Assemblyman Fred Keeley have yet to take shape 
as formal proposals. But an aide to Burton said some key lawmakers are so 
"desperate" to keep Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California 
Edison from following PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric into 
bankruptcy court that they are willing to consider anything that will takse 
residential consumers out of the equation. 
"The idea is that the large industrial customers are the ones who pushed for 
deregulation in the first place, so they should be responsible for bailing 
out Edison," the aide said. "We're looking to take the burden off of 
residential ratepayers." 
The premise of a plan discussed by lawmakers on a conference call Thursday is 
to designate Southern California Edison's largest commercial ratepayers as 
non-core customers. Those customers -- some 3,600 users of more than 500 
kilowatt-hours a month -- would be responsible for financing the cost of 
power the utility must purchase or have purchased for it in the wholesale 
market. The non-core customers would also help the utility recoup most of its 
$5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs through a surcharge on their bills. 
Core residential customers would be protected from the wholesale power market 
as the primary beneficiaries of the low-cost power the utilities generate 
themselves or have locked up in long-term contracts. 
Enron Pushing Access to Customers 
Separately, Enron Corp. (ENE) has been lobbying lawmakers for several weeks 
to win approval to sign power-supply contracts with Southern California 
Edison's largest commercial customers, leaving the utility to serve just its 
residential customers and small businesses, aides to Gov. Gray Davis, Messrs. 
Burton and Hertzberg said. 
An Enron executive confirmed that the company sent a four-page proposal to 
Mr. Hertzberg proposing that Southern California Edison's large industrial 
customers sign so-called direct-access contracts with Enron. Enron also has 
recently made a presentation about direct access to some members of the 
California Chamber of Commerce. 
Under the proposal, heavy users would be required to contract directly with 
companies like Enron for their power. 
Direct access was a key part of the state's 1996 deregulation plan, but was 
scrapped early this year when the state started buying wholesale power in 
place of the utilities. 
The core/non-core proposal is one of several being discussed by lawmakers as 
alternatives to a memorandum of understanding Mr. Davis struck with Edison in 
April. The MOU -- which doesn't vary much from an agreement in principle 
reached in February -- has been called dead on arrival by some lawmakers, who 
have been mulling various alternatives rather than moving the agreement 
forward. 
State Sen. Debra Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate 
energy committee, said there are so many "Plan B's" floating around the 
Legislature that, "We're going to need to hire an apiculturist." 
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said the Davis administration 
is still dedicated to seeing legislation to enact the memorandum of 
understanding move through the Legislature, but said separating the utility's 
"core and non-core" customers would be at the forefront of new discussions. 
It was too early to say whether the governor would support the plan, he said. 
Dominic DiMare, a lobbyist with the California Chamber of Commerce, said the 
chamber has told the Davis administration that shifting the burden of the 
Southern California Edison bailout to businesses is "a very bad idea" that 
could cost the state billions of dollars in economic activity. 
"This [plan] would really screw businesses," Mr. DiMare said. "We just got 
hit with a 50 to 90% rate increase. We're dangerously close to losing our 
businesses to other states."

Construction of power plant in DeSoto County is underway
By TIMOTHY R. BROWN
Associated Press Writer

05/31/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) - A North Carolina-based independent electric power plant 
developer and operator has started construction on a $490 million generating 
facility in DeSoto County. 
Cogentrix Energy Inc. will build the 800-megawatt power plant in Southaven on 
40 acres next to existing TVA and Entergy electric substation facilities. The 
plant is the largest economic development project in the history of the north 
Mississippi county.
The second largest project is a $150 million power plant currently being 
built by Duke Energy. 
Both are expected to be operational in 2003. 
The National Energy Production Corporation, a subsidiary of the Enron Corp., 
is serving as the engineering and construction contractor for the Congentrix 
project. 
"It is in construction as we speak," Jeff Freeman, Congentrix vice president 
for corporate communications, said Thursday. "NEPCO is mobilized on site and 
they are doing earth work. It will probably take them 24 to 27 months to get 
the plant in commercial operation." 
Freeman said the Charlotte, N.C., company found several reasons why building 
a plant in Southaven, a fast-growing city located just south of Memphis, 
Tenn., was a good investment. 
"The first thing that we look for in any project is a basic need for the 
commodity that we produce, which is electricity," Freeman said. "The area 
served by the transmission systems, TVA and Entergy, at this location provide 
access to areas that need electricity." 
The plant will use natural gas as fuel and will include the latest in 
environmental and combustion control technologies, Freeman said. 
Cogentrix owns all or part of 27 facilities with a capacity to generate about 
7,000 megawatts in 14 states. 
Southaven Mayor Greg Davis said both plants will generate about $300,000 to 
the city, in lieu of taxes, and about $1 million each to the county school 
system. 
Davis said the plants will not employ many workers so traffic in the area 
will not increase. He also pointed to the positive impact of temporary jobs 
during construction. 
"Then, road and bridge tax that they will be paying is substantial also," 
Davis said. "So from a financial impact we will see a great return in the 
investment."

Two Executives Leave Houston-Based Energy Firm's Broadband Arm

08/31/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Houston Chronicle - Texas
Copyright (C) 2001 KRTBN Knight Ridder Tribune Business News; Source: World Reporter (TM)

Two Enron Corp. executives who headed the company's foundering broadband business left Enron to pursue other opportunities, Enron said Thursday. 
Ken Rice, 43, chairman and chief executive of Enron Broadband services left, as did Kevin Hannon, 41, chief executive of Enron Global Assets and Services. Hannon had been president and chief operating officer of the broadband unit.
Both men previously had other executive roles at Enron. 
Rice had most recently been helping Enron to move its pared-down broadband operation into its wholesale services division. Wall Street has been expecting Rice to leave Enron. 
Enron's broadband business suffered as the telecommunications industry melted down. A deal with Blockbuster that fell through earlier this year was also considered a setback. 
For the second quarter, broadband reported a $102 million operating loss, compared with an $8 million operating loss for the same quarter a year ago. 
When Enron reported second-quarter results in July, it said it would significantly reduce spending in broadband "to match the reduced revenue opportunities currently available." 
The elimination of up to 250 broadband jobs in April preceded the announcement. 
The two departures follow Jeff Skilling's surprise announcement about two weeks ago that he was stepping down as Enron's chief executive officer for personal and family reasons.

Utility could raise some rates by 60 percent

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) - Nearly 730,000 Portland General Electric customers could see a rate hike of 30 to 60 percent Friday if state regulators approve the increase as expected. 
PGE's 637,000 residential customers would see a rate increase of roughly 30 percent, while its 90,000 business customers could face increases of 40 to 60 percent, according to PGE estimates.
"The price increase is completely about power costs," said Peggy Fowler, the utility's president and chief executive officer. "We've tried to hold off as long as we could. But these truly are unprecedented times." 
Since late last year, utilities throughout the Northwest have been raising rates by double-digit percentages. PGE avoided the trend by coming out ahead on power trades and deferring some costs. 
The utility serves more Oregonians than any other in the state. Most of its customers are in the Willamette Valley. 
PGE requested the increases a year ago. If the Oregon Public Utility Commission announces Friday it has approved the request - as is expected - the new rates will take effect Oct. 1. 
Customer advocacy groups questioned whether PGE could justify the need for such a large increase. 
"They should be looking for ways to cut spending" to offset the rise in power costs, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board. 
Julie Brandis, a lobbyist for the 19,000-member Associated Oregon Industries, said PGE should cut payrolls and slash operating budgets before raising its rates. 
She said rate increases of up to 60 percent mean thousands of dollars of additional monthly expenses to businesses already struggling to survive. 
"It will greatly impact the economy of Oregon," she said. 
PGE officials said the rate increases reflect the projected costs of buying and generating electricity from Oct. 1 on. 
Power costs beyond what had been anticipated for Jan. 1 through Sept. 30 have been accumulating in a deferred account set up by regulators. The company will file another rate request next spring to recover those costs, officials said. 
PGE serves customers by generating electricity at utility-owned power plants and by buying power on wholesale markets. The split between company-generated and purchased power is roughly 50-50. 
This year, wholesale prices on short-term, or "spot," markets have dropped dramatically, from a high on May 9 of $520 a megawatt hour to Thursday's low of $22.22 a megawatt hour. 
The drop hurts PGE, which earlier this year purchased extra supplies of power in anticipation of profitable trades this summer and fall. 
PGE residential customers pay about 5.8 cents a kilowatt hour, plus a monthly flat fee of $5.50. Customers use, on average, about 1,000 kilowatts a month. 
The increase incorporates a new tiered-rate structure, in which customers pay one rate for the first 225 kilowatt hours and a higher rate for additional energy use.

INDIA PRESS:Fincl Cos Want MSEB To Buy Dabhol Electricity

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Indian lenders to U.S.-based Enron Corp.'s (ENE) unit, Dabhol Power Co., are insisting on the resumption of the purchase of power by its sole buyer, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board, from the 740 megawatt first phase of the DPC plant, reports the Economic Times. 
The financial institutions, led by the Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), have said that unless phase I of DPC is reactivated the cash flow of DPC won't improve and it will be difficult for the project to find a buyer, according to the report.
The matter was discussed by a committee comprising the financial institutions, MSEB, Central Electricity Authority and India's Ministry of Petroleum. The MSEB has not given any commitment, but has asked the financial institutions to submit a formal proposal in this connection, the report added. 
The financial institutions supporting Dabhol have an exposure of over 51.25 billion rupees ($1=INR47.14). Enron has a 65% controlling stake in the Dabhol project. 
The DPC's phase I 740 megawatt power plant has been inoperative since May 29 after the MSEB claimed the company's power tariffs were "exorbitant and unaffordable," and stopped drawing electricity. Work on the roughly 95% complete 1,444 megawatt Dabhol phase II was also stopped soon after the dispute began. 
The Dabhol-MSEB dispute is before the courts.

India: US and China: Back to courting

08/31/2001
Business Line (The Hindu)

POLITICALLY hard and unyielding, but economically flexible and alluring. 
Those are the defining characteristics of the present Chinese leadership.
Even while welcoming American businessmen with open arms and going out of its way to facilitate their business activities in China, Beijing never hesitated to stand firm against the US when its national interests were involved. 
It never allowed its interest in US investment flows to dilute its adherence to its political principles, and it never allowed the frictions in its relations with Washington due to its adherence to its principles to prejudice it in its attitude towards American businessmen. Beijing learnt that what was really important was not the certificate of good governance from American political leaders, but from their businessmen. 
The Chinese leadership also learnt many years ago that: 
* Political frictions between two capitals do not necessarily deter US businessmen so long as they are assured of the safety of their lives and investments and have a free hand in making profits. 
* In a globalising world, business interests are an important component of strategic interests and no US administration, Democratic or Republican, can afford to ignore the views and interests of its businessmen. Ultimately, the compulsions of business interests will prevail over those of ideology and politics. 
Dark clouds had gathered over US-China relations ever since Mr George Bush Jr. was elected the US President in November last. A paranoia over what was projected as likely threats to US interests in the Asia-Pacific region due to the fast-emerging Chinese economic and military power was the dominant feature of the campaign speeches, of the debates in Republican circles before the inauguration, and of the actions of the new Administration in its first few months in office. 
No other members of the new Administration reflected this paranoia more disturbingly than Mr Donald Rumsfeld, the new Defence Secretary, and to a lesser extent, Ms Condoleezza Rice, the National Security Adviser. China was projected as a strategic competitor and not partner as it had been glorified to be by Mr Bill Clinton, the previous President. 
Actions such as the attention to the Dalai Lama when he visited Washington DC and clearance to arms sales to Taiwan in the face of Beijing's opposition were all influenced by the conservative, distrust- China lobby in the Republican Party. 
Gen (retd). Colin Powell, Secretary of State, who is more a professional than an ideologue, found himself without adequate voice in policy-making with regard to China in the first few months. It is the ideologues who prevailed. 
But things started changing from the day Mr Rumsfeld allegedly issued an order suspending periodic interactions between the armed forces of the US and China, which had been initiated by the Clinton Administration as a confidence-building measure. It was reported that the past President, Mr George Bush Sr, the father of the current incumbent, was shocked by this order and pointed out to Gen Powell and Ms Rice the inadvisability of unnecessarily needling China. 
Mr Rumsfeld wriggled out of an embarrassing situation by claiming that his instruction for a case-by-case clearance of future interactions had been misinterpreted by a Pentagon official as suspension of the interactions. It was from that time onwards that one could see Gen Powell playing a more active role in China policy-making and a beginning of a possible diminution in the role of Mr Rumsfeld and Ms Rice. Other influential personalities too joined in strongly deploring the anti-China paranoia being created by the conservative ideologues which, they pointed out, could be counter-productive. 
Dr Henry Kissinger, former National Security Adviser and Secretary of State, was one of the strongest critics of this artificially-created paranoia. How can a nation (China) with an annual defence budget of $12 billion pose a threat to a nation (the US) with an annual defence budget of $350 billion, he asked. He pointed out that just because China was modernising its Armed Forces in keeping with its present-day requirements, it could not be perceived as a threat to American interests. 
China conducted itself during these difficult months in an exemplary manner. It kept up its strong criticism of the US policies towards Taiwan and Tibet and on espionage flights. It joined hands with Moscow in strongly opposing the missile defence initiative of Mr Bush. It kept up its clandestine supply of missile and missile components to Pakistan. According to American intelligence estimates, as quoted by the Washington Times, 12 consignments have gone by ship and road to Pakistan since Mr Bush Jr assumed office. It did not hesitate to prosecute American nationals/residents of Chinese origin arrested on charges of spying, but let them leave the country after a proforma conviction. 
At the same time, it kept reiterating its continued interest in a co-operative relationship with the US and underlining the inevitability of the restoration of the warm vibrations of the past. It stepped up its imports from the US in order to reduce the trade deficit, which is presently unfavourable to Washington. It accelerated negotiations on pending business contracts with US companies. According to the latest Chinese Customs figures, Chinese imports from the US increased 17.9 per cent to $12.5 billion as against only a six per cent increase in exports to the US ($25.02 billion) during the first half of this year. 
Beijing reportedly permitted five of its airline companies to buy 36 Boeing-737 aircraft with a combined price tag of $2 billion and the Air China to purchase four Boeing 737-800s. 
One could see the benign impact of the pressures on the Administration from professional strategic experts and business interests in the changed language during Gen Powell's visit to Beijing in the last week of July, 2001. After his one- day talks in Beijing with President Jiang Zemin and other Chinese leaders, he said: "We view China as a friend, not as an adversary." He never once used the expression, 'strategic competitor'. 
Gen Powell emphasised the Bush Administration's desire to build "constructive, forward-looking relations" with China. "China and the United States have a strong common interest in seeing a stable Asia and a world where economies can thrive and security needs can be met," he added. 
He admitted that major differences remained on issues such as Taiwan, China's proliferation of weapons of mass destruction such as its continued supply relationship with Pakistan and human rights, but added that Beijing had agreed to the subjects of proliferation and human rights being further discussed by experts from the two countries before President Bush's visit to China in October. 
Thus, one could see that Sino-US relations are on the mend as a result of re-thinking in Washington. Mr Clinton too came to office in January, 1992, with a negative image of China which later on turned into a very positive one, but this transformation took some time to come about. In the case of Mr Bush, it has come about within seven months of his assuming office. 
India has valuable lessons to learn from this. Our policy towards the US is perceived by many to be politically malleable, but economically devoid of content. The rapidity with which we welcomed Mr Bush's missile defence initiative, even when the US' closest allies such as the UK preferred to wait and study before reacting, the way we seem to have allowed the positive assessment of the US security experts on Pakistan's Gen Pervez Musharraf to prevail over the negative assessment of our own experts, thereby, creating the Agra embarrassment, show a tendency to let judgments and actions in such matters be influenced by US perceptions. 
At the same time, the economic dimension of India's relations with the US has not received the required attention. Even earlier, the analysts of conservative think-tanks close to the Republican Party viewed the economic management of the Government as lackadaisical. 
This negative perception seems to have been strengthened by the Enron case. There is, consequently, a danger of the interests of US businessmen in India gradually evaporating. 
The country seems to be under an illusion that foreign businessmen will flock to it just because it has a functioning democracy, a modern legal system and a population of one billion. More than this, what is important is their perception that India has a government which manages the economy competently and makes the business atmosphere investor-friendly, for domestic as well as foreign investors. One looks in vain for such a perception.
