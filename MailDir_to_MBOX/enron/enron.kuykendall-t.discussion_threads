Tori -- please let me know if I did not correctly capture the essence of our 
conversation this afternoon about what is going on in California.  I would 
also like to have you take a look at the draft of the filing when I get it to 
make sure our facts are okay.

Thanks.

Subject: Leslie's summary of conversation w/Steve Kean

Leslie was not sure she had your e-mail address right, so I told her I'd 
forward it just in case.

Would you go ahead and take a stab at writing up a response?  I will have 
Melinda send in a plain intervention in hard copy so you can file the 
comments electronically if we need more time.

I also talked to our West Desk trader about out California business.  She 
trades El Paso and TW.  ENA has about 80 MM of released capacity -- 60 MM at 
Topock and 20 MM at Ehrenberg.  We are nominating our max volume, but because 
of allocations, it doesn't flow 100% due to cuts.  About half of the gas is 
spot and half is base load (base load being 30 day deals done at 
first-of-month index pricing, which is about $14).  The base load markets are 
mostly PG&E and other utility core customers.  The biggest spot markets are 
the power generators.  Our spot gas is trading on Enron OnLine.  We put a bid 
and an offer price on each deal, and the prices are generally close.  The 
trader says that as soon as she puts an offer on the screen it gets hit.

Hope this helps.  Call and leave me a message if you need anything else 
tomorrow morning.  I will be at the doctor's office probably most of the 
morning, but I will check in occasionally.

Thanks.

Talked to Steve Kean.  Here is what he wants to argue:

Price caps don't work.  Look at the Cal ISO experience.  If prices are kept 
down, there won't be supply available.  

Best thing is to let the market see the price increases REAL TIME, so that 
they can act on those prices.  In California, very few customers are seeing 
the results of  $40 gas right now.  There is no conservation due to price 
movement, and so demand stays high, prices keep going up, and customers will 
die of shock next month.

Also,. rather than blaming marketing affiliates for the situation, look to 
what the California utilities are doing.  Are they taking gas out of storage 
(steve thinks not much)?  Are they reselling the gas?  El Paso Marketing does 
not control a signfiicant portion of the market even with their 1.2 Bcf.  The 
real issue is to have consumers receive real time pricing signals so that 
demand can react to the prices.

I would also add the arguments that the proposed caps and re-regulation would 
not take care of the problems.

We need to get something for Ina for Admin Asst's Day - it is tomorrow.  I 
will take a collection of $10 from each person and get a gift certificate 
from Foley's if that is okay with everyone.  I will probably have to go get 
the gift certificate tonight - so please dont stick me with more than my 
share of the bill. ( Thats what happened last time)  Thanks.

not to be inconsiderate, but we did get him a gift last year and it seemed 
like nobody was really that interested in doing it.  we think it's dangerous 
to start buying birthday presents for some people and not others and the 
group thinks it's best if we dont start the trend.  we definitely want to do 
something for boss's day every year, but we think it's best to keep the 
birthdays simple.

Subject: trader joke



A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am 
trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve 
been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to 
change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe 
$145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for 
making the semi-finals?

Hey Melba -- We would like to create a new product with the following product 
name:  EPNG SoCal Ehr.  This product name should be used under the product 
type US Gas Phy.  The description should contain the same language as the 
EPNG SoCal Topk product except the word "Ehrenberg" should be substituted 
every time the word "Topock" appears.
 
We would also like to create physical index products for this trading point, 
but we need to change the short description of the current NGI SoCal index 
product to allow for the addition of the specific point name, and we would 
also have to change the description of the original index product as well.
 
I left you a message to call me if you can today.  Thanks.

Highway 38 early Monday<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; morning. Woodruff
County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the

Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Billy Ray
Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are listed in
serious<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; condition at Baptist Medical Center.
The accident occurred as the<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; two men were
returning to Des Arc after a frog gigging trip. On
an<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up
truck headlights<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; malfunctioned.&nbsp; The two
men concluded that the headlight fuse on<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the

just before crossing the river, the bullet
apparently<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; overheated, discharged and struck
Poole in the right testicle. The<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; vehicle
swerved sharply to the right exiting the pavement
and<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; striking a tree. Poole suffered only minor
cuts and abrasions from<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the accident, but will
require surgery to repair the other wound.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wallis sustained a broken clavicle and was treated and
released.<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank God we weren't on that bridge
when Thurston shot his balls<BR>&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; off or we might
both be dead" stated Wallis. "I've been a

Hey Jack - I'm assuming you don't know the last name, but I'm betting you 
haven't known alot of other Tori's in your lifetime.  Anyway, I've been 
feeling nostalgic lately, so, I thought I would see what was up in your 
life.  I got married about 6 years ago, and I live with my husband, Pat, out 
in Katy.  I'm working at Enron downtown, doing commodity trading.  We're 
expecting a little girl in June, our first baby.  Anyway, I'd love to see 
what's going on with you.  Write back if you can.

Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
me an email - let's catch up.

Click on the following URL....and then hit New Product! about the middle of 
the screen.  You can now enter in city ids and get current weather 
observations from those cities.  It will automatically update as new 
information comes in.

http://ecthou-webcl1.nt.ect.enron.com/research/Weather/WeatherMain.htm

If you need help with station identifiers, let me know.

hey martin - i know i havent paid for the fantasy league at all - but i am 
trying to figure out how much i owe - i think 3 of my transactions shouldve 
been free because 1 was to change kickers on the same team and 2 were to 
change my defense on the bye week - so, without any winnings - i think i owe 
$145 - can you verify?  thanks.  also - can you tell me if i won anything for 
making the semi-finals?

Hi.  I am an employee at Enron and I have applied for an infant spot in the 
new day care center.  I was wondering when we would be notified as to whether 
or not we have been accepted.  I know the center doesn't open until 
September, but for me it will be first time child care and I need to line 
something up if I do not get in.  Also , do you know an exact date for the 
scheduled opening?  Thanks for your help.

Subject: Warning Mildly Offensive But Funny As Hell


Thirsty Cowboys:

Two cowboys from Texas walk into a roadhouse to wash the trail dust from 
their throats. They stand at the bar, drinking their beers and talking 
quietly about cattle prices.

Suddenly a woman at a table behind them, who had been eating a sandwich, 
begins to cough. After a minute or so it becomes apparent that she is in real 
distress, and the cowboys turn to look at her.

"Kin ya swaller? asks one of the cowboys.

No, the woman shakes her head.

"Kin ya breathe?" asks the other.

The woman, beginning to turn a bit blue, shakes her head No again. The first 
cowboy walks over to her, lifts up the back of her skirt, yanks down her 
panties, and slowly runs his tongue from the back of her thigh up to the 
small of her back.

This shocks the woman to a violent spasm, the obstruction flies out of her 
mouth, and she begins to breathe again.

The cowboy walks back over to the bar and takes a drink of his beer. His 
partner says, "Ya know, I'd heard of that there Hind Lick Maneuver, but, I 
never seen anybody do it."

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I
cut
off

I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather 
Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an 
email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori 
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping 
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop me 
an email - let's catch up.

Tori,

What we'll have to do is to move those products which are in the restricted 
product types to the regular product types.  Then I will set the restricted 
product types to archived. We will need to coordinate as to when you want to 
do this.

Thanks,

Melba

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep

Hello , my name is Tori Kuykendall (One Pass BJ927934).  My husband, Patrick( 
One Pass VF751282), and I have been One Pass members for a few years now as 
well as elite members on several occasions.  We also use Chase Continental 
Visa exclusively, and my husband is a President's Club member.  I have made 
Continental my airline of choice for as long as I can remember booking my own 
travel arrangements and have been a very satisfied customer in the past.  
This morning, however, I had a very bad experience.  I booked tickets for a 
vacation back on September 4th for a trip from Houston to New York on 
December 1.  Since I booked the ticket, I became pregnant and found out from 
my doctor last week that I will still be unable to travel on December 1st due 
to complications with my pregnancy.  My doctor indicated to me that I may not 
be able to fly at all during my pregnancy, which is due to end in June.  I 
spoke to Leroy Peterson this morning to explain the situation, and he 
indicated that all he could do was give me credit that would expire on 
September 5th, 2001 and that a $75 service would be charged to me next time I 
book a ticket for me or my husband.  I understand that this is the same 
policy that you would have given me if I had just decided that I didn't feel 
like taking a vacation this weekend.  In my opinion, this is an unacceptable 
policy in the event of medical complications.  As you can see with my 
situation, it is unlikely that my husband and I will be able to plan a 
vacation by September of 2001 considering we will hopefully have a 2 month 
old child.  I repeatedly asked Leroy if there was anyone else who could help 
me or anyone I could talk to in order to get some kind of exception to your 
policy.  I indicated that I could provide a doctor's note if necessary.  He 
was very rude to me, stating "You don't have to ask me 7 different times for 
the same thing - I already told you NO!"  I had to cancel a flight for work 
about a month ago on Southwest airlines for the same reason, but I was hoping 
that I would be able to fly again by now.  For your information, your 
competitor was very helpful.  They accepted my doctor's note, gave me a 
credit good for one year, and will allow me to change the ticket to another 
person's name if I am still unable to use it.  That ticket was also booked as 
a non-refundable fare.  Although I have always used Continental  for my 
personal travel, the treatment I have had in this difficult time has 
definitely made me second-guess my future choices.  If there is anything you 
can do to help, I would greatly appreciate it.

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to

Tori -- Can you provide any insight into Leslie's inquiry, highlighted 
below?  I don't usually look at the capacity release screens.  I'm not even 
sure if I would have access to the information.

Some more thoughts:  apparently if we check the pipelines' EBBS, we will see 
that there were few if any short term capacity releases into California at 
above max rates.  I don't know if Becky can check this out in the time 
remaining, but perhaps we can note this as something FERC needs to look 
into.  Also, there may have been some relationship between the "soft" 
electric rate caps and the gas prices.  In other words, the electric cap 
would be lifted if market conditions warranted, and those market conditions 
were, essentially, high gas prices.  I am not quite sure how to argue this, 
but here it is.

I have an open order that was placed on 1/2/01, and the availablity on the 
item said that it would ship in 24 hours.  I chose regular shipping, which 
should mean that it should be on its way.  However, the order status still 
says that it hasn't shipped.  How can I find out what it causing the delay?

We have two new products on the west desk that we would like to launch march 
1st.  The descriptions are set up and ready to go, but we need to make these 
RESTRICTED products just like the EP Blanco.  The customer list, however, 
will be different than the blanco list.  We need to get on this right away.  
Please let me know what I need to do.

hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
products?  let me know...

Hi everyone!
Hope you had a wonderful holiday. We sure did. The dogs loved playing in
snow for the first time in Colorado. Chris and I returned unscathed.

If you haven't already, please update my email address to my work email:

pam_macaul@bmc.com <mailto:pam_macaul@bmc.com>

I don't check my Hotmail account very often anymore.

Kyle, does Dana have a new email address?

Talk with you soon.

Subject: April 2001 Nomination


All-

The total nomination for month of April 2001 is 10,506MMBtu per day.  This
includes:

1. 4,135MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Kingsgate (4,006MMBtu/day @ Malin);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased from March 2001 to 3.12%.  We have
not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

To review the phone conversation between Jan and me, we are planning to shut
down our last steam plant for maintenance from midnight March 30, 2001
through 1800 or so April 11, 2001.  Kim and I have arranged for Enron to
purchase the non-APEA gas during that period.  At this time, we believe that
the power plant will burn enough gas during the last 20 days of the month to
use the APEA gas.  If anything changes, I will notify you.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

Subject: trader joke



A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

Congratulations on the new house, a job you love, and the baby on the way.
Do you remember Chou? (my dog)  You're never going to believe this...but she
turns 18 on January 3rd.  I think she found the fountain of youth somewhere
and never told me about it. but told the other animals...the rabbit's 8 1/2,
2 of my birds are pushing 9yrs, etc.  (little lovebirds...I think 9 yrs is
really unexpected for them...guess the birds aren't aware of that. :) )

If you hadn't told me what Enron does, I wouldn't have ever known.  I've
never heard of them.  Are they local to Houston?

Very cool that you and Patrick (Pat?) were set up on a blind date...proof
that those work sometimes!  Well, believe it or not, I still have a little
bit of Xmas shopping to do, so I better go.  Talk to you soon.

Heather

Christmas is just around the corner and it's time to plan our "all girl" 
Christmas lunch and gift exchange.  For the new employess, all the girls on 
the desk draw names and exchange gifts at a Christmas lunch.  Gift price

Once Tori is under Dr's care that's when the sick time starts........It could 
be a few days before the delivery depending when the Dr ask the employee to 
stay home, sometimes the don't stay home.  The first day the employee is out 
for delivery or pre-delivery purposes sick time should start.  If the an 
employee has not taken any sick time since January this year they are 
eligible for 4 weeks sick pay at 100% and the following sick days are paid at 
90%.  Until the Dr releases the employee all her time should be
coded sick, once the employee is release she should return to work or make 
other arrangements with HR Rep.

Ben,

Tori Kuykendall will be on maternity leave beginning in June.  How much sick 
time/maternity time can she take before it goes to 90% ?  

Please advise at your earliest convenience.

Many thanks,

i'm sorry if i am not being understanding about this situation, but i if you 
really look back at the last 5 jobs you've had, i think i have been more than 
understanding about letting you do whatever you wanted to do.  it really 
hurts me that your pride in this situation is more important to you than 
spending time with your pregnant wife and your daughter.  i can't talk to you 
about this anymore if you are unwilling to understand my point of view.  once 
again, if the situation were different, i would tell you to do whatever you 
wanted.  but, this time it's different and i hope you can see that.  i love 
you!

I ordered a computer and printer on the enron click at home program and i 
received a confirmation, but it seems as if it's only for the computer and 
not the printer.  My order number is 507208940.  Can you check on the status 
of the printer?  Thanks.

 Player Updates?Scouting Reports? 
 Latest NFL Player News 

 Cade McNown , QB CHI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 McNown will return as the Bears' starting quarterback for this Sunday's game 
against the 49ers after missing six weeks with a separated shoulder. Fantasy 
owners who have advanced this far into the playoffs should not consider 
picking up McNown for this week's game. He is too much of a risk after 
missing an extended period of time, especially at this point of the season.   

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.   

 Dolphins , DT MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Miami's defense once again showed why it is one of the league's finest 
units, holding the Buccaneers to only three field goals in a 16-13 loss. 
Tampa Bay's touchdown came on 31-yard interception return by Bucs' linebacker 
Jaime Duncan. The Dolphins host the Colts this week, whom they held to only 
14 points back in Week 12. Starting the Miami D is a must during the final 
weeks of the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Olindo Mare , K MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Mare has nailed his last 12 field goals in a row, including two on Sunday 
against the Bucaneers. Look for the Miami placekicker to get a few chances to 
score this week against the Colts, as the Dolphins looks to put a 
stranglehold on the AFC East title.    

 Tony Martin , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Martin caught five passes for 67 yards in his first start since returning 
from a foot injury. With very little playing time under his belt in recent 
weeks, Martin is a very risky player to consider for your starting lineup 
during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Gadsden caught four passes for 75 yards but was held out of the end zone in 
last week's game against the Buccaneers. He faces a Colts' secondary this 
week that held him to only 30 yards receiving in Week 12. However, he did 
score a touchdown in the game. Gadsden is a cinch starter this week in 
leagues requiring three starting wideouts, and should also be considered for 
leagues with two receiver sets as well.   

 Adam Vinatieri , K NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Vinatieri has been one of the league's most accurate  placekickers in recent 
weeks, converting on 18 of his last 19 field goal attempts. He should get his 
chances against the Bills this week, especially if Buffalo's defense 
struggles like it did on Monday night. Unless you have one of the league's 
elite kickers on your roster, giving Vinatieri the start is a good idea.   

 Jermaine Wiggins , TE NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Wiggins has been a real surprise since being signed by the Patriots two 
weeks ago. In his first two games with New England, Wiggins has caught nine 
passes for 80 yards and touchdown - decent numbers for a tight end. If you 
lose Chad Lewis becuase of Philly's bye week and need a replacement, picking 
up Wiggins could pay off.   

 Raymont Harris , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Harris, who was just recently re-signed by New England, carried the ball 
only three times for 14 yards in his first game back. With the Patriots 
constantly rotating tailbacks, Harris' Fantasy value is in serious question. 
It's good idea to avoid all New England tailbacks at this point in the 
season.   

 Troy Brown , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Brown has caught two touchdowns in the last two weeks and is making a case 
to be on your Fantasy playoff team late in the year. He will face a Buffalo 
secondary this week that has been hurt by injuries, so giving Brown the start 
in leagues that require three wideouts isn't such a bad option.     

 Ricky Watters , RB SEA -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Watters missed Tuesday's practice with a turf toe injury. Watters was able 
to play at Denver this past week despite the problem. Don't expect him to 
miss this week's game against Oakland.   

 Terry Glenn , WR NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Glenn finally got into the end zone last week against Chicago, which is a 
good sign for Fantasy owners at this stage of the season. He will get his 
chances to score this week against the Bills, who have really been hurt by 
injuries on defense.   

 Napoleon Kaufman , RB OAK -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Kaufman has a bruised right leg in addition to his quadriceps injury. He 
might not play at Seattle, and Terry Kirby might be activated. Randy Jordan 
and Zack Crockett would see more playing time with both Kaufman and Jon 
Ritchie out.    

 Kevin Faulk , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Faulk will likely be splitting time with both J.R. Redmond and Raymont 
Harris for the remainder of the season, which is not the scenario Fantasy 
owners are looking for at this time of the year. There is only one Faulk in 
the NFL who deserves to start in your Fantasy playoffs - and he plays in St. 
Louis.   

 J.R. Redmond , RB NE -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Redmond only saw limited action last week against the Bears because of his 
injured ribs, which have taken a toll on his production. It isn't certain how 
much playing time he will get in the final two weeks, so it's a good idea to 
keep  Redmond on your bench during the Fantasy playoffs.    

 Cardinals , DT ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 You want to talk about defensive inefficiency? Arizona's defense has given 
up an average of 32.4 points per game over their last five games. If for some 
reason you've held onto the Cardinals' defesne this long, you're probably 
already out of your league's playoffs. If not, make sure to look anywhere but 
Arizona for a starting defense.   

 Cary Blanchard , K ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Blanchard has converted on only four of his last nine field goal attempts 
for Arizona, which has decreased his already low Fantasy value. Being the 
placekicker on a team with an enemic offense doesn't help, either - the Cards 
have only scored 42 points over the last four weeks. Give Blanchard the boot 
for the remainder of the Fantasy playoffs.   

 Frank Sanders , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Will the real Frank Sanders please stand up? After three poor performances, 
Sanders caught four passes for 90 yards and a score against Jacksonville. 
Fantasy owners never know what they're getting with Sanders from week to 
week, which is why he isn't a viable option during the playoffs.   

 David Boston , WR ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Boston struggled to produce for Fantasy owners against Jacksonville last 
week, and will likely be in for another rough week against the Ravens. 
Baltimore sports the number one defense in the NFL, and has allowed only 
eight touchdowns through the air the entire season. Avoid using Boston this 
week if at all possible.   

 Thomas Jones , RB ARI -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Jones had 40 yards on seven carries in last week's loss to the Jaguars. The 
rookie could see added carries as the season comes to an end, but he still 
shouldn't be considered a starter during the Fantasy playoffs.  

 Torry Holt , WR STL -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Holt has a slight hip injury but will play in this week's game.  Expect him 
to maintain a high level of play during the final rounds of the Fantasy 
playoffs.    

 Herman Moore , WR DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Moore had a headache from hitting his head on the turf in the Lions' first 
offensive play Sunday.  He was knocked groggy, but X-rays showed no damage.  
However, if you put him in your Fantasy lineup at this point in the season 
his production will damage your playoff hopes.  Avoid using him if you 
can.         

 Alfred Pupunu , TE DET -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Lions cut tight end Alfred Pupunu and signed safety Ryan Stewart. 
Pupunu, a former San Diego Charger, has no Fantasy value right now.   

 Eddie George , RB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 George re-injured the big toe on his right foot during Sunday's game, and 
took a pain-killing injection and is wearing an immobilizing boot to help in 
his rehabilitation. His Fantasy owners have to be hoping he'll play against 
Cleveland, a team against which he has 344 rushing yards and seven TDs in his 
last three games, on Sunday.  

 Steve McNair , QB TEN -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Coach Jeff Fisher said McNair's sprained ankle is "swollen, stiff and sore," 
but it's far improved over where he was last week. McNair is expected to play 
Sunday against Cleveland, and we can't help but expect good numbers from him 
after his impressive three-TD performance last Sunday against Cincinnati.  

 Steelers , DT PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 The Steelers will be without strong safety Lee Flowers for Saturday's game 
against Washington. Flowers is second on the team in tackles and is tied for 
the lead in forced fumbles, and has an undisclosed knee injury. Ainsley 
Battles will get the start in his place. Pittsburgh's defensive unit hasn't 
been posting great numbers in recent weeks, so it might be wise to skip using 
it against Washington on Saturday.   

 Courtney Hawkins , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Hawkins has lost his starting job at split end to Troy Edwards, after a poor 
performance last Sunday against the Giants. Hawkins had just two catches for 
seven yards in the game, and hasn't been getting it done in recent weeks. He 
has no Fantasy value the remainder of the season.  

 Troy Edwards , WR PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Edwards will get the start at split end, in place of Courtney Hawkins, for 
Saturday's game against Washington. He had 61 catches playing there last 
season, but wasn't as successful at flanker this year. Despite this switch, 
we don't forecast good Fantasy numbers from Edwards over the final two weeks. 
 

 Kordell Stewart , QB PIT -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Stewart was given a day off from practice on Tuesday in order to rest his 
sprained right calf. He said that the decision was a precautionary measure, 
and that he'd be back in practice Wednesday and will start Saturday against 
Washington. Stewart has a tough matchup with this Redskins pass defense - 
he's a risky start during your Fantasy playoffs.  

 Vinny Testaverde , QB NYJ -  Updated 12/13/00 
 Testaverde has been upgraded from questionable to probable for Sunday's game 
against the Lions. He injured his groin in last week's game in Oakland, but 
has returned to practice and is taking his normal reps with the first team 
offense. Fantasy owners who have Testaverde are breathing a collective sigh 
of relief as the Fantasy playoffs near an end. The Jets' quarterback should 
have some success this week against Detroit, whose secondary has been ravaged 
by injuries.

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.

hey andrew -- just seeing how things were going with you.  i was at dinner 
the other night with jojo and your name came up, so i thought i would drop 
you a note.  where are you these days??  things are pretty much the same 
around here -- trevor is planning a trip to come see me when the baby is born 
-- only 3.5 weeks til d-day -- maybe a little earlier if i'm lucky.  wasnt 
sure if i told you that i'm having a little girl -- she wont be spoiled or 
anything.   overall i have to say that pregnancy hasnt been that bad of an 
experience -- other than the lack of partying which in my case is probably a 
good thing.  keith holst was asking about you -- said to tell you hi -- so 
"hi".  thats all from h-town for now.  hope you're doing well.

Subject: trader joke



A very successful energy trader parked his brand-new Mercedes in
front of his
office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. As he
got out, a
truck passed too close and completely tore off the
door on the
driver's side. The trader immediately grabbed his cell
phone, dialed
911, and within minutes a policeman pulled up.

Before the officer had a chance to ask any questions,
the energy trading icon
started screaming hysterically. His Mercedes, which he
had just picked
up the day before, was now completely ruined and would
never be the
same, no matter what the body shop did to it.

When he finally wound down from his ranting
and raving, the
officer shook his head in disgust and disbelief. "I
can't believe how
materialistic you energy traders are," he said. "You are so
focused on your
possessions that you don't notice anything else."

"How can you say such a thing?" asked the trader.

The cop replied, "Don't you know that your left arm is
missing from
the elbow down? It must have been torn off when the
truck hit you."

"My God!" screamed the master trader. "Where's my Rolex?"

We would like to begin trading a new product on EOL.  The location - PG&E 
Topock -  has already been set up, but we would like to make a small change 
to the long description.  The line which reads  -  "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E, El Paso."  should be changed to "The transaction is for 
delivery at PG&E Topock"    Please let me know when we can review the change, 
as Mike Grigsby would like to begin trading this product as soon as 
possible.  Thanks.

Hey! Wow an expectant mother. Im still the consummate bachelor, but I guess
eventually I will fall off the wagon :) Who knows what will happen, right?.
Im excited for you. It was great to hear from you and see you at the
reunion, and I apologize for not contacting you sooner. Actually I told
Geoff to contact you through Rachel, but I guess that situation went south,
along with my plan! Anyway, it sounds as if things are really going well for
you and I am gratified to hear it.
 I actually last heard from Heather a while back. She kills me. I wont hear
anything and then ill get a card or letter or something. I assume she is
still in LA. She gave me all her addresses et cetera but I lost them when I
moved. I suppose I could pull up her driver's license and get her mailing
address.
 I will probably get to Houston some time in the near future. My mom came up
here for Xmas so I havent been down since October. With weekends off now
though it will be easier for me to go visit.Id love to see you. Send me back
an email when you can.

 Robert

Subject: May nominations


All-

The total nomination for month of May 2001 is 10,526MMBtu per day.  This odd
number is made up of the sum of the following:

1. 4,026MMBtu/day purchase from Engage @ Malin (net, after PG&ENW  losses
4,135MMBtu/day @ Kingsgate);
2. 3,000MMBtu/day APEA gas;
3. 1,000MMBtu/day balance of year strip purchased on behalf of Azusa @
$7.71/MMBtu;
4. 2,000MMBtu/day under two separate fixed contracts of 1,000MMBtu/day each;
4. 500MMBtu/day March 2001 through Feb strip purchased @ $7.63;

Losses on the PG & E line have decreased again from April 2001 to 2.63%.  We
have not sold any of the APEA gas (3,000MMBtu/day)at this time.

We will still operate with only one steam unit (Broadway 3) on line for most
of the month.  Sometime about the fourth week of May, we will be bringing
one more steam unit on line.  At that time, I may need to increase our
nomination.  With the increasing temperatures and the possibility that the
ISO will begin paying generators, we expect our fuel usage to actually reach
and occasionally exceed our nomination in May.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

here are the two new index descriptions that we need:
 
For Socal Ehrenberg --  NGI SoBord Scal Ehr
For Socal Topock --       NGI SoBord Scal Top
 
 
Then, just to clarify on the PG&E Topock product -- here is the special 
language that we need to use -- "The volumes scheduled to be delivered are 
subject to reductions due to normal operational constraints on all 
interconnecting pipelines at this location based upon historical operating 
conditions.  The reductions caused by these are excused nonperformance and 
are not considered a failure to receive or deliver firm gas."
  
We do not want to specifically mention el paso pipeline because the gas can 
come from a variety of different pipelines, all of which can have operational 
constraints.  I think this is close enough to the original language that it 
should not be a problem.  Thanks for your help.

A man enters his favorite ritzy restaurant and while sitting at his regular
table, he noticed a gorgeous woman sitting at a table nearby....all alone.
He calls the waiter over and asks for their most expensive bottle of Merlot
to be sent over to her - knowing that if she accepts it, she is his.

The waiter gets the bottle and quickly sends it over to the girl, saying
this from the gentleman. She looks at the wine and decides to send a note
over to the man.  The note read: "For me to accept this bottle, you need to
have a Mercedes in your garage, a million dollars in the bank, and 7 Inches
in your pants."

The man, after reading the note, sends one of his own back to her and it
read: "Just so you know - I  happen to have a Ferrari Testarosa, a BMW
850iL, and a Mercedes 560SEL in my garage; plus I have over twenty million
dollars in the bank. But, not even for a woman beautiful as you, would I cut
off
three inches.  Just send the bottle back."

This is too funny:

A quote from "Centuries,"  a book
of prophesies written by Nostradamus.

"Come the millenium, month 12, in the home of greatest power, the Village
Idiot will come forth to be acclaimed the leader."

just got your email address from rachel.  congrats on your promotion.  i'm 
sure it's going to be alot different for you but it sounds like a great 
deal.  my hubby and i moved out to katy a few months ago.  i love it there - 
my parents live about 10 minutes away.  new news from me - i'm having a baby 
- due in june.  i can't even believe it myself.  the thought of me being a 
mother is downright scary but i figure since i'm almost 30, i probably need 
to start growing up.  i'm really excited though.  rachel is coming to visit 
me in a couple of weeks.  you planning on coming in for any of the rodeo 
stuff?  you'll never guess who i got in touch with about a month ago.  it was 
the weirdest thing - heather evans.  i hadn't talked to her in about 10 
years.  seems like she's doing well but i can never really tell with her.  
anyway, i'll let you go.  gotta get back to work.  looking forward to hearing 
back from ya.

Attached is a draft of the comments we intend to file in the subject 
proceeding.  This is obviously a "work-in-progress".    It has been forwarded 
for review to several other people in the company, including the Enron lawyer 
who is working on the litigation on the lawsuit about electricity pricing, so 
there may be other changes.  If they are significant and there is time, I 
will run them by you again.

Please review and contact me ASAP (and no later than 2:00) if you have any 
comments or input.  This filing must be made this afternoon, and we have to 
give the D.C. lawyer time to make final revisions to the document and get it 
to FERC.

Thanks.

Hey Sheri.  How's everything going?  Hope you had a good time on your Vegas 
trip.  I haven't even had a chance to talk to Jen about it.  I had a question 
for you -- Do you know of any job openings that would be good for Pat.  I 
have his resume to forward if you think there is anything out there.

Tory-

Sorry for being late.  I did call on Friday and left a message with Jaynie
(?) or Jamie (?).  As I told her, we would like nominate 7,000MMBtu per day
for the month of November 2000.  Losses on the PG & E line are unchanged
from October 2000 at  2.88%.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

-Steve

Have you ever asked your child a question too
many times? I hope you remember my story when they start getting
frustrated! My three year old son had a lot of problemswith
potty training; and I was on him constantly. One day we
stopped at Taco Bell for a quick lunch between errands. It was
very busy, with a full dining room. While enjoying my taco I
smelled something funny, so of course I checked my seven month
old daughter. And she was clean. Then I realized that Matt had not
asked to go potty in a while, so I asked, and he said, "No." I kept
thinking, "Oh Lord, that child has had an accident and I don't have any
clothes with me.
"Then I said, "Matt, are you sure you did not
have an accident?" "No," he replied. I just knew that he must have
had, because the smell was getting worse. So I asked one
more time, "Matt, did you have an accident?" This time he
jumped up, yanked down his pants, bent over and spread h! is
cheeks and yelled "SEE MOM, IT'S JUST FARTS!" While
100 people nearly choked to death on their tacos, he
calmly pulled up his pants and sat down to eat his food as if
nothing had happened. I was mortified but some kind elderly
people made me feel a lot better when they came over and thanked me
for the best laugh they had ever had

Tory-

Sorry for being late.  I did call on Friday and left a message with Jaynie
(?) or Jamie (?).  As I told her, we would like nominate 7,000MMBtu per day
for the month of November 2000.  Losses on the PG & E line are unchanged
from October 2000 at  2.88%.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Thanks.

With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced 
to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase 
our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid 
Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 
and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to 
the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing 
system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This 
conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize confusion, we will convert all Stentofon addresses in 
EB1 to a 4000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then 
your new number will be 4364.)  We will also change all speed dials to 
reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group 
of this change.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Tori,

Actually I recognized the name right away...I hear things (infrequently) 
through the grapevine.  I had sent quite a few birthday and Christmas cards 
to your parents' old address (Evelyn Circle--?? or something like that) 
before I heard that they were out in Katy somewhere and that you were back in 
Houston and had gotten married.  I wanted to go to the reunion, but was 
shooting a commercial for something (Subway??---Christie may remember better 
than I do since she wanted me to go with her and I couldn't.)

Good to hear from you!!  I think about you often and still have an old 
picture of you in one of my wallets.  :)

I am currently sitting in a hotel room in Orlando, FL.  I have been here 
working (spokesmodel for IBM and some of it's affiliates) and am very ready 
to fly home tomorrow.  It has not been the best trip I've ever had, but I'm 
sure it's not the worst either.  I now live in Los Angeles about 90% of the 
time and Central Texas about 10% of the time.  Not really enough time in 
Texas for my taste, but that's the way it is for now.  My Dad and Helen 
(wife---wonderful woman) live out near Lake Travis in that house he's had 
since 1991 and Dad and Uncle Van bought the Blanco River Ranch out in Blanco 
County quite a few years ago...so I live at one place or the other when I'm 
in TX.

I guess some things eventually come true...I've been part of the Screen 
Actors Guild for many years now and spend quite a bit of time on the set of 
whatever project is keeping me busy.  I actually have taken a few months off 
lately to recoop from many months of 17-hour days.  I act, model, tutor high 
school kids and assist my boyfriend with his store when I can.

What have you been up to?  Any kiddos yet?  What's your address?  What do you 
do?  Do you ever make it out this way?  I'm sure I have about a billion other 
questions that I could ask to catch up on however many years it's been....

Hope to hear from you soon...

Tell your mom, dad, and Scott that I said hello.  Oh my God!!!  Scott's gotta 
be about 18 by now.  Okay...now I feel old. :)

Love,
Heather

<< I have been wondering for the last couple of months if this is THE Heather
Evans that I was friends with for so long.  So, I am finally writing you an
email.  I know you don't recognize the last name, but, it's me - Tori
(Hatter).  I'd love to know what is going on in your life.  I was hoping
you'd make it to the reunion last year.  Anyway, if you get a chance, drop
me an email - let's catch up.
