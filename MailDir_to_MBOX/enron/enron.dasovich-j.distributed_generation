Yes, I would like to be apart of any meeting that covers DG from the 
regulatory side.  My comments would most likely focus on the interconnection 
issues, rather than the who the competitors should or shouldn't be.

Subject: Developing Enron Position on DG Issues for Use in California

Please forward this along to anyone else whom you feel needs to be included.  

We recently discussed having a meeting in Houston to hammer out the Company's 
position on issues related to distributed generation.  Would be useful to 
have that meeting as soon as we can, since we'll need to let the California 
Commission know our position on the following issues by February 1st:

Utility participation in DG--should utilities participate?--(and implications 
of such on market power, interconnection, safety & reliability, rate design 
and cost allocation).
Whether net metering should be expanded and applied to all DG.
Consumer education about the availability of DG.  Is there a need for it?
Suggestions for outreach that state government could offer to local 
governments with the intent of helping locals streamline environmental review 
of DG.


In addition, we'll need to express our view on the following issues by March 
17th:

Should the utility be required to establish an unbundled distribution 
wheeling tariff?
Whether a DG selling "excess power" to the grid is a "public utility" in 
California.
Whether the CPUC or FERC has jurisdiction over sales of "excess power."
Does California need to establish scheduling and dispatch protocols to 
support DG sales of "excess power?"
What concerns, if any, should California have with respect to DG and the 
possibility of locational market power?
What should rates look like for standby charges, bypass charges, stranded 
costs?  Is there a role for PBR?

Is it possible to have the meeting next week?  I can be in Houston on 
Wednesday, Thursday or Friday.

Best,
Jeff

Further, staff talks about the benefits of DG:

One other thought regarding confidentiality:

In view of our argument for transparency, assuming full tranparency in the 
distribution system planning process, the utility may also have information 
provided by retail customers that may also be confidential for the same 
reasons given below.  We certainly would not want the utilities to be 
permitted to not have to provide that info to us, but I would assume we would 
honor the confidentiality of that info in the same manner we are asking the 
utilities.  Does this make  Any comments.
(I bring this up only to the extent that on the settlement conference call 
the other day the woman from PG&E mentioned confidentiality of info in 
passing comment regarding transparency).  Any other thoughts?

Subject: Re: Siting Committee Hearing - Interconnection Rules  

I will most likely not be able to attend.  However, my comment relating to 
this issue was a generalization of confidentiality clauses I've used on other 
interconnect agreements and other contracts, including the "model" 
interconnection agreement recently submitted to FERC by EPSA.  In essence, 
the issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to 
disclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in 
connection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility 
output, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and 
maintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail 
customer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential 
information between the generator and retail customer).  This information is 
potentially competitive and should be held confidential.  Potential wording 
for a simplified confidentiality section would be as follows:

"Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or other 
provisions of law or as otherwise provided for in this Rule, the Electic 
Provider shall hold in confidence any and all documents and information 
furnished by the Electric Customer in connection with the interconnection, 
provide however, that to the extent it is necessary for the the EP to release 
or disclose such information to a third party in order to perform the EP's 
obligation herein, EP shall advise said third party of the confidential 
provisons of this Rule and use its best efforts to require said third party 
to agree in writing to comply with such provisions."

Should an Enron rep be present to do so? Me or another?

Bruno,

I was wondering if you would be willing to speak for 5-10 minutes on Tuesday 
regarding Section 2.7 of the proposed Rule 21 language (confidentiality of 
information)?  I was hoping you could convey your concerns for the Committee. 
We have also added language in the report stating the Energy Commission has 
previously urged positions similar to Enron's at the CPUC, but the CPUC has 
not accepted them.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Scott

I spoke with John Nimmons regarding the subject settlement discussions on 
Tuesday.  He shared with me his view on several matters.

1.  He's not sure what SCE is up to.  He believes they will not move off of 
their position of DG ownership however convoluted it may be (basically they 
want to keep the "option open" of customer-side DG ownership).  He also 
believes they most likely will not participate in further discussions.  He 
has a call into SCE to see if he can come to some understanding on where they 
stand.  (He also said they indicated they are most likely going to drop out 
of DPCA).

2.  John believes PG&E was responding to the Commission's position regrading 
DG ownership as outined in the Cmmisson's rule that states the Commission has 
not found any compelling reason to prevent ownership of DG bu UDC's.  He 
thinks they are not interested in customer-side DG as a business but only as 
an option to site mobile DG under emergency conditions.  He also believes 
that this issue is not a showstopper for them and they would most likely give 
it up (DG ownership) if others such as DPCA and Enron would support a PBR 
that gave them the right incentives.

3.  Next Monday's meeting will focus on the distribution only wheeling tariff 
issue (minutes of the last meeting and an agenda for Monday's meeting should 
be out today).  He thinks this will be the most contentious issue of all 
based on his reading of the utilities' testimony.  The utilities' postitions 
are that you can't separate distribution from transmission when dealing with 
the grid since their is much interdepence.  

I think we should continue to participate in these  meetings.  I'm planning 
on participating by phone.  I don't expect SCE to participate but if we 
change PGE's ownership position we would have 2 of the 3 utilities with us 
which strengthens our position.  It will also be interesting to see what the 
utilities have to say regarding distribution only tariffs.  ANy thoughts?

Greg, Roger:

Please put Ed Solari, Joseph Graham and Tim Vail on your CC list on these 
issues.  Ed and Joe are building out the portfolio management capability, 
i.e. making a market in local generation resources and Tim is pushing the 
technology enveloppe.

Thanks

Roger - thanks for the review; we want to raise the "wholesale distribution" 
concept

Jeff - we will rely on GA to identify our most successful forum (e.g. 
workshop, hearing, other); generally we are in support of this proposed 
decision as it establishes a CPUC/CEC commitment to address "behind the 
meter" competition and the role of the UDC  

Phil - we will require technical engineering experts for the workshops and

Distribution Competition

Jeff,

The purpose of this e-mail is to reply to your e-mail to EESO requesting 
input on the CPUC's draft decision on distributed generation and electric 
distribution competition.  As you already know, EESO is very interested in 
"behind the meter" competition including distributed generation, as well as 
other competitive opportunities.  I understand that decision puts forth 
procedures and identifies issues that need to be addressed for distributed 
generation and electric distribution competition.  The decision does not 
address an opinion on the issues identified; hence, I will not be providing 
EESO's position on the issues.  The decision provides for testimony on issues 
at a later point in time.  We will defer to Government Affairs expertise on 
what are the most appropriate procedural steps.  I will limit my analysis to 
identifying any issues that were not addressed by the decision.

The following is an outline of issues that I believe were identified by the 
decision:

I. Retail Competition
 A. Wires Competition
  1. Distributed Generation/Distributed Energy Resources
   a. Interconnec tion (Workshop)
Definitions
Size Limitations
Voltage Level Interconnection options
Changes to Rule 21 for broader application, eliminating QF distinctions
"Type Testing"
Safety (Testimony)
Islanding (Workshop)
Statutory Amendments
b. Ownership an Operational Control (Staff Report)
Siting
Jurisdiction
UDC and affiliate ownership (Testimony)
c. Environmental Impacts
Air Quality
Visual Impacts
Noise Impacts
d. Rate Design and Cost Allocation
Cost Shifting
Stranded Investment (Testimony)
Bypass Fee (Testimony)
Standby Rates, including Firm v. Non-Firm (Testimony)
Flexible Rate Offering
e. Distribution System Planning Process (Workshop)
System Benefits
Reliability
Losses
Deferral of Distribution Investments
Relieve Constraints
DG  Distribution Valuation System (Testimony)
Additional costs
Impacts on PBR
f. Net Metering (Testimony)
Statutory Limitations
Rate bypass Issues
Public Purpose Programs
Consistency for all generation technology
g. Dispatch and Scheduling of Excess Generation (Workshop and Testimony)
Market Power
Must Run
Statutory clarification on what is a utility
Jurisdiction
h. Future Role of UDC (Testimony)
i. Distribution Service for Generators
Distribution-only Service (Testimony)
Jurisdiction (Testimony)
Unbundle Voltage Service Levels
j. Other
Impacts on California Air Resources Board
Emissions Credits
Impacts on Local Air Quality Districts
Local Governments
Building Codes & Permits
California Environmental Quality Act (Workshop)
2. Competition with Irrigation and Municipal Districts (Energy Division 
Report)
 a. Local Government Franchises
 b. Stranded Costs
 c. Rate Flexibility
 d. Statutory Amendments for uniform construction, inspecition, reliability & 
safety standards
 e. Obligation to serve
 f. Statutory Amendments for uniform Public Purpose Program requirements
 g. Local government tax advantages
3. Privatization of Distribution (Energy Division Report)
 a. Safety & Construction Standards
Interconnection
b. Uniform Standards
Jurisdiction
Legislative clarification
c. Obligation to Serve
d. Line Extension Rules
e. Public Purpose Program charge bypass
Alternate ways of funding
f. Wires only service unbundling
g. Rate Design
Bypass Charge
Standby
Rate Flexibility
Average Rate Structure
 h. Master-Meter & Submetering
Impact on construction costs
DSM cost effectiveness
Price Signals
Scale
Safety and Reliability
Impact on Direct Access Customer Choice
Cost Shifting
Legislative Amendments
Submetering Accuracy
Local Government Weights & Measures
Rates to submeter customers
4. Rights-of-Way Competition (Energy Division Report)
 a. Cooperation of Local Government
5. Independent Distribution Operator
 a. Pros/Cons
 b. Costs
 c. Use of ISO
 B. Energy Competition (Energy Division Report)
  1. Clear Separation of Monopoly & Competitive Services
   a. Cross-subsidies
  2. Provider of Last Resort v. Default Provider
   a. Competition for Default Provider Role
   b. Monopsony Market Power to influence market prices
   c. Mandarory PX Buy Requirement for Provider of Last Resort
   d. Economies of scale enjoyed fy the Default Provider
 C. Other (Energy Division Report)
  1. Social, Labor, and Economic Impacts
  2. DG Consumer Education

I believe this is  a fairly comprehensive list.  However, there are some 
issues that I believe should either be identified or if already identified  
better defined.  First, in the Energy Division's assessment of Energy 
Competition and the clear separation of monopoly and competitive services, 
the Energy Division should identify all of the assymetric rules, 
responsibilities, and expectations placed upon ESPs compared to those of the 
UDC default service provider.  For instance, hourly interval metering 
requirements only apply to direct access customers and not to standard offer 
customers.  Costs to fulfill regulatory requirements by the ESP are expected 
to be recovered from market transactions; whereas, the utilities recover 
these costs in non-competitive service rates.  These are examples of 
competitive barriers that disadvantage ESPs.  Secondly, the decisions 
reference to Standby Service on page 17 inappropriate implies that Standby 
Service is only available from the UDC, when in fact ESPs can supply Standby 
Generation Service as well.  The issue of Standby Service needs to unbundle 
Standby T&D service from Standby Generation service, where these two issues 
are looked at independently.  Third,  in addressing the Distributed 
Generation issue of distribution service for excess generation the issue of 
bidirectional distribution service needs to be more fully explored.  In other 
words, if the customer is expected to pay for distribution service as a load, 
some of the costs of distribution service for excess generation should be 
offset by the payments already paid for distribution charges to the load.  
Fourth, the issue of voltage service levels is in part addressed with respect 
to interconnection.  Discounts for voltage service levels should be addressed 
with respect to both loads and generation.  Finally, the issue of 
interruptible service should also be addressed, because it is an unresolved 
issue that is related to the issues above about distribution system benefits.

attached.  Edits, comments etc. most welcome.  As Paul knows, I'm hoping to
publish this sometime this spring.  One other thing you guys should be aware
of is that I have been working this with the environmental community almost
from the inception and have their strong support.  I designed the concept to
appeal across a broad coalition, recognizing that I may NOT be able to get
Commission support and so had better have broad customer/stakeholder support. 
I don't know where you all are with the environmental community but I wanted
to mention this.  Hope to see you soon.

Below is a draft standby tariff that was prepared by Enron and others during 
settlement negotiations in Mass (the tariff was never formally submitted) 
that might be of use as we prepare for California Ph II (and New York).  

Also, I was talking with Sara McKinley of the DPCA and they are not going to 
participate in the Phase II proceeding due to lack of funding.  However, she 
mentioned that CMA, Capstone, New Energy, and Honeywell have jointly hired 
John Nimmons for this phase and that DPCA may endorse their testimony.  She 
also asked if she could get a copy of our testimony to review and perhaps 
endorse.

Attached is a barrier report released yesterday by Secretary Richardson



FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
           May 31, 2000

           NEWS MEDIA CONTACT:
           John B. Townsend II, 202/586-5806

                          Energy Department Report Identifies Barriers
                      Blocking Competition In Electric Utility Industry

                      Distributed Power Projects Could Reduce Power Outages

           Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson today released a comprehensive
report that documents, for the
           first time, the marketplace barriers that prevent electric utility
customers, developers and vendors from
           creating projects that would enable consumers to generate their own
electricity. According to the
           Energy Department report, distributed power systems that produce
electricity onsite can reduce the
           amount of power utility companies need during peak demand and help
prevent power outages.

           "Hundreds of millions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of work
hours are lost each year due to
           power supply disruptions that could otherwise be avoided if the
barriers to distributed electricity
           generation were removed," said Secretary Richardson. "When 
facilities
 such as hospitals and
           businesses with computers or other critical electronic technology 
can
 get power from either the grid or
           their own generating equipment, energy reliability and security 
will
be greatly improved."

           The newly released Department of Energy (DOE) report contains a
10-point action plan for reducing the
           technical, business practice and regulatory barriers that 
discourage
interconnection of distributed
           generation technologies to the electricity grid in the United 
States.
 The report, Making Connections:
           Case Studies of Barriers to Interconnection of Distributed Power, 
is
the first to document the problems
           the developers of distributed electricity generation projects
encounter while attempting to interconnect
           to the electric grid.

           Onsite generation, also known as distributed electricity 
generation,
allows residential, commercial and
           industrial customers to produce their own electricity by using
smaller, decentralized, electrical
           generation systems located at or close to their facilities. Power
sources for distributed electricity
           generation systems include fuel cells, microturbines, 
photovoltaics,
wind turbines and combined heat
           and power systems. The technology reduces the need to build new 
large
 central generating plants or
           transmission and distribution lines. The report concludes,
distributed power systems at industrial
           plants or commercial buildings can be more energy efficient and
provide greater reliability onsite than
           conventional central generating stations.

           The Energy Department examined 65 distributed electricity 
generation
projects. Of the 65 case
           studies, only seven reported no major utility-related barriers.
However, in most cases, substantial
           regulatory, technical and business-practice barriers exist, which
inhibit distributed generation
           interconnection to the grid in the United States. For example, 17
projects, more than 25 percent of the
           case studies, experienced delays greater than four months.

           Other findings include:

                Lack of a national consensus on technical standards for
connecting equipment.
                Lengthy and costly approval process that hampers competition
from smaller distributed
                generation projects.
                Unfamiliarity by utility companies in dealing with
customer-generator interconnection requests.
                Costly regulatory appeals that prevent relatively small-scale
distributed generation projects.

           Although a handful of public utility commissions across the country
have adopted rules on
           interconnection, the report concludes that removal of the barriers
will require the participation of
           industry, utilities, developers, environmental groups and state and
federal regulatory agencies. The
           report outlines an action plan for reducing barriers to distributed
generation. Some of the
           recommendations include:

                Adoption of uniform technical standards for interconnecting
distributed power to the electric grid.
                Acceleration of the development of distributed power control
technology and systems.
                Development of tools for utilities to assess the value and
impact of distributed power at any
                point on the grid.
                Establishment of new regulatory tariffs and utility incentives
that help reduce regulatory barriers.

           According to the report, many of the artificial market barriers to
distributed generation grow out of
           long-standing regulatory policies and incentives designed to 
support
monopoly supply. Distributed
           generation promises greater customer choices, efficiency 
advantages,
improved reliability and a host of
           environmental benefits.

           Copies of the report are available at
http://www.eren.doe.gov/distributedpower/barriersreport/

           Secretary Richardson discussed the report's findings during remarks
today at an electricity reliability
           summit in Akron, Ohio. During the summit, government officials,
regulators, labor representatives,
           utility company executives and consumers discussed ways to enhance
the reliability of Ohio's electric
           system. Since late April, Secretary Richardson has co-hosted 
similar
summits in Hartford, Newark,
           New Orleans, Sacramento, Seattle and Houston.

Phase 2 testimony is due May 26, 2000 and addresses rate design issues 

Rate design and ratemaking proposals submitted in testimony should follow the 
principles: 
1. provide for fair cost allocation among customers;

2. allow the utility distribution companies (UDCs) adequate cost recovery 
while minimizing costs to consumers; 

3. facilitate customer-side distributed generation deployment; and send 
proper price signals to prospective purchasers of distributed generation. 

Testimony should identify how current rate structures and those proposed in 
other Commission proceedings may prevent or hinder deployment of distributed 
generation, and how rate structures could be modified to facilitate 
distributed generation deployment.  Parties should discuss the 
interrelationship among rate design issues:  stranded costs, bypass, demand, 
customer and grid charges, standby rates, and PBR and flexible pricing 
mechanisms.
Additionally, rate design issues related to interconnection costs should be 
addressed.  Issues include cost recovery and allocation, such as who should 
pay for costs to interconnect to the distribution system and for 
interconnection studies, or if costs incurred by the first distributed 
generation customers on a specific circuit or feeder should be shared by 
subsequent distributed generation customers connecting to the same facilities.

The attachment (Attachment A) provides 36 questions and a framework for the 
issues the Commission will consider in Phase 2 of this proceeding.  

See attached ruling for details.

This follows up on Jeff's message.  Attached are the Phase 2 questions issued 
by the ALJ in the California DG proceeding.  The questions relate to stranded 
costs, standby charges, distribution wheeling, exit/bypass fees, PBR 
structures and other rate design issues.  We're looking for your input on 
which questions raise the most important policy issues for Enron. -Bob

Please forward to others whom you think might want to participate.  I 
apologize in advance if I've missed anyone from the original team.

Now that Sue Mara and Tom Hoatson have brilliantly represented Enron's views 
in Phase 1 of California's DG proceeding (aided significantly by Bob Frank's 
stellar legal skills), it's time to move on to the next set of issues for 
Phase 2.  The Phase 2 issues principally address rates issues (e.g., 
stand-by, back-up, stranded cost recovery), but also include about 40 
questions issued recently by the judge presiding over the festivities.  Bob 
Frank will distribute the questions first thing tomorrow morning.

Would like to have a call either Thursday afternoon, or Friday morning (CST) 
to determine:

1) which, if any, of the issues/questions posed by the California PUC Enron 
cares to prepare responses for, and,
2) Enron's position on the issues identified.

Would very much like to profit from any recent DG activities others have been 
engaged in elsewhere (e.g., Lisa and Harry in Maryland).

Is there a preference for Thursday afternoon or Friday morning.  Please let 
me know.

Best,
Jeff

I will most likely not be able to attend.  However, my comment relating to 
this issue was a generalization of confidentiality clauses I've used on other 
interconnect agreements and other contracts, including the "model" 
interconnection agreement recently submitted to FERC by EPSA.  In essence, 
the issue is that the utility should not have the unilateral right to 
disclose any information to anyone they want that is sent to them in 
connection with a DG interconnection.  This would include ownership, facility 
output, markets for energy or capacity or ancillary sevices (if any) and 
maintenance schedules (these schedules may be coincident with a retail 
customer's facility maintenance schedule which itself may be confidential 
information between the generator and retail customer).  This information is 
potentially competitive and should be held confidential.  Potential wording 
for a simplified confidentiality section would be as follows:

"Unless compelled to disclose by judicial or administrative process or other 
provisions of law or as otherwise provided for in this Rule, the Electic 
Provider shall hold in confidence any and all documents and information 
furnished by the Electric Customer in connection with the interconnection, 
provide however, that to the extent it is necessary for the the EP to release 
or disclose such information to a third party in order to perform the EP's 
obligation herein, EP shall advise said third party of the confidential 
provisons of this Rule and use its best efforts to require said third party 
to agree in writing to comply with such provisions."

Scott Tomashefsky is asking me to present our position on the confidentiality 
clause in Rule 21 at the CEC Hearing on 4/25. Any thoughts. I hope to be able 
to respond to him today.

Should an Enron rep be present to do so? Me or another?
Bob are you coming to Sacramento?

Bruno,

I was wondering if you would be willing to speak for 5-10 minutes on Tuesday 
regarding Section 2.7 of the proposed Rule 21 language (confidentiality of 
information)?  I was hoping you could convey your concerns for the Committee. 
We have also added language in the report stating the Energy Commission has 
previously urged positions similar to Enron's at the CPUC, but the CPUC has 
not accepted them.

Please let me know at your earliest convenience.

Scott

 <<Erin Brockovichrev3.doc>> 

Dear all, here is a proposed quid (separation of ownership of DG from 
dispatch) pro quo (discounts, exit fees, standby charges reasonable to DG).? 
Not intended to supplant? UC/CSU's excellent 8 points but to put some flesh 
on the bones of some of those points. Main idea is that if ORA et al receive 
support for separation of ownership from dispatch, we can be supportive of 
reasonable rates pertaining to DG.? Please comment.

FYI.  The case management statements are due May 5.  I'll forward Rule 49
separately so that you can start thinking about what we need to say in it.
Also think about who we are aligned with for purposes of cross-examination
panels.

Subject: Upcoming Scheduling PHC in R.99-10-025



Good afternoon everyone- I wanted to let you all know a bit more about what
I hope to accomplish at the 5/10 PHC for the DG proceeding. It is my hope
that we will leave the PHC with a planned witness order for the hearings.
Therefore, parties should come prepared to discuss witness availability and
cross estimates by witness. In fact, if you can provide estimates to me
informally prior to the PHC, I would greatly appreciate it.

Any work that the parties can do ahead of time to reduce to scope of issues
that require cross is appreciated. In the scoping ruling, Commissioner Bilas
directed that a case management statement be submitted consistent with Rule
49. We are looking forward to seeing that. In addition, I'd like you all to
consider offering panels of witnesses for cross in the event that you have
significant alignment of positions with other parties. This should reduce
the time required as well. We will not tolerate repetitive cross or friendly
cross, therefore, the parties with aligned positions should also consider
designating a representative to cross witnesses in order to reduce hearing
time. (If witnesses have corrections to their direct or rebuttal testimony,
these should be submitted in writing as an errata exhibit, whenever
possible, in order to reduce additional direct on the stand.)

During the hearings we will run 9-1 Tuesday-Friday, Mondays we will run
10-4. This gives us approximately 28 hours of cross time. If parties
estimates exceed this amount of time, the Commissioner and I will allocate
time accordingly.

In addition, at the PHC I intend to identify the direct and rebuttal
testimony with exhibit numbers so that we do not need to spend time doing
that at the hearing. We will also set a date by which any motions to strike
testimony are due.

I hope this information is helpful. See you in a couple of weeks!
