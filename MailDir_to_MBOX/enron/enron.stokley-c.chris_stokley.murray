Preston,

Here is a start for the requirements documentation.  I have not had a ton of time to work on this and plan on drilling down into more of the detail the remainder of this week and all of next week.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Diann,

I agree with you that Maurice appears to be the resource with the most knowledgeable in the areas we are diving into.  

However,  The point here is that you committed to take ownership of  action items which came out of a meeting we had last week (I was dialed in from Portland).  It was expressed in our meeting the importance of the information we are looking an a time frame we hoped to get it in.

Chris Stokley sent you a few message in follow-up to ensure that progress was occurring and you failed to respond to anyone letting them know that you would not be the point person spearheading those action items.  (Until a week later)

We are now another week into this transition and still unable to deliver interval meter data to the business units requesting it.  If it takes CSC a week to make it available to us.  We could have had today or tomorrow.  Now it would be another week.

We all know who the responsible resources are now.  Thanks for sending that out.  It is time for us now to focus on end results and getting this data in-house.  

Thanks - MO

It was not my initiative to have this follow-up meeting, nor was I even invited to it.   When we met last week, I stressed that Maurice knew the systems better than I and I would have to defer to his recommendations.  When he was invited to the meeting earlier this week, I assumed you were engaging his expertise and that I was not needed.  

I apologize for the misunderstanding.   However, I trust Maurice's recommendations as being the most logical.  If you still need us to pursue the Energy Sense proposal, let me know.

Diann,
	You should have notified me that you had passed this off to Maurice and not acted on it since we talked last Wed. From here on out I will assume that Maurice is the key person to get these issues resolved. Based on the e-mail below, I lost one week by your not having this conversation w/ a CSC rep last week. This is a week that we could not afford to lose. 

Maurice,
	Let me know what we need on our side to get the MDMA process escalated to a high priority item. Also, what is the estimated time of delivery from CSC once we make this a priority?  I agree w/ you best scenario recommendation, I would just like to be able to compare delivery dates b/w the two process that you have laid out. Thanks for your help on these items.

			Ps. When next week can we expect CSC to deliver these accounts to the FTP server? Also, what time the next day can we pull the files off 
			      Of the server?

									Chris

Chris,

In our meeting with Pat Priestley yesterday, she said it would not be difficult to post a CSV file to an FTP server for all the Interval Meter Data accounts in MV90.  Pat said that to post it in the Energy Sense format (MDEF) would be very difficult because of how the system operates.  

Pat also confirmed that they do not post data from all MV90 accounts to the MDMA on a daily basis.  I asked her if they could change this process and she said that it was something they have been wanting to do, but it has not been a high priority.  

I recommend that we get the daily CSV file from the FTP server and import it into the Load Database that John Rutledge is developing.  Pat says that if we can have the Work Request completed today, we could have this set up next week. 

The best scenario is for all the data to be posted to the MDMA daily, so we can possibly get CSC to make this a high priority.

Maurice

	We have a few paths that we are looking into, including the one that we discussed w/ Maurice. Never at any time in that meeting did we decide not to look at the paths listed below. Does this mean that you have done nothing to facilitate these request to CSC?

	Do you have an update on the status of the other two items we discussed.

1)	CSC's ability to send all of our Calf. Customers files out to the FTP server as they do with the Energy Sense customers, along with the  timeline to get this implemented.
2)	The cost and timeline to put all of our customers into the Energy Sense website.

	Even,

	Who do I need to contact to see a copy of the current Enron to CSC project request log.
The current project log for CSC projects is on the CSC/EES information exchange web site at this url - <http://csc-enronix/chg_req/IT_Projects.pdf>
	Do we have a listing which contains the following information:

	Request description

	Requestor

	Date of request

	Quantifiable justification for request

	Cost to Enron for CSC to do the request

	Enron's priority of request

	Enron's preferred date of completion

	CSC targeted date of completion.

	CSC current status (% complete)
Most of the above information is contained in the report referenced up above.  The remaining information may be found in the actual request itself, which is maintained, along with all associated correspondence, amendments, approvals, etc., in a soft library my group manages on the J: drive.
	Is there a formal reporting process of these requests and is there a group who manages the priorities to make sure they are in-line with the current business needs.

  
My group manages the request process and ensures adherence to the Work Request Guidelines.  Priorities for projects are determined based on the requested delivery date.  If a new request has a delivery date that causes problems with the completion of other existing projects, then the owners of the conflicting requests are contacted to rearrange project completion dates and reset expectations.  Additionally, we hold a monthly Executive Project Status review where all requestors can conference in and discuss issues related to their projects.
	Can you also tell me if CSC is off on their cost estimate for doing a project does Enron get billed actual project cost or just estimated costs
We are billed actuals, however there is an agreement that we will only pay overruns up to 15% of the project cost (almost all projects are IT in nature and we feel this is a fair margin in estimation error).  My group is responsible for validating charges on the invoice, and we monitor the charged project costs.  We will negotiate overruns on a project-by-project basis as they occur.  We also perform a function up front of cost haggling on estimates if requested, or if we note something unusual.
	Any information you can provide related to this request would be appreciated.

	Thanks - MO

Hi Stewart,

	I am hoping to get this old issue resolved and I have that the last time we talked about this (with Thresa Allen & Diana Scholtes) was back at the end of March.  This is for the Transmission Profit Sharing that we owe California Department of Water Resources for the month of December.  Right now I have that we need to pay them $189,148.34 (CDWR profits) and this is also what you have in your spreadsheet (see attached) and what they invoiced us.  However, I was told not to pay them until you all had determined what the PX shortfall annuity would be that you would put in and apply against this payment to CDWR. Has this annuity been determined?  I would like to move this payment through our system since it is now almost 8 months old.  Let me know as soon as you get a chance,  when you expect for the Cal. PX shortfall annuity to be determined and entered, so that this Dec. payment can be sent out.

Thanks so much - Amy

Who is going to send out the final proposal?  I would like to see the simple solution vs. the detailed / major system change solution.  I want to be able to take them back to management and justify what we are doing in your project.  Building a tool in-house which will calculate consumptions bands and other charges.

Jason/Tom

The Mack-Cali deal is getting hot and they hope to sign an Master and CA confirm on this Thursday.

The client has a major issue with the excess and deficiency only cutting in Enron's favor.

The desk does not have an issue with letting it cut both ways.  I'm am currently investigating this with the consumption group.

Does your group have any issues with allowing it to cut both ways?   I know there is a settlement issue, but we've done it in the Boston Properties and other deals, so I'm assuming that the systems are build (or being built).

Given the tight time frame on this deal, a quick response would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

B

Murray,

Hi.

I manage EWS Site Profile Desk, which is responsible for identifying, pricing and managing consumption risk in all EES deals. I understand from Jeff that you will be responsible for Power settlements and will be able to help me in developing appropriate actualization / settlement processes. I would love the opportunity to get together with you and talk about these issues at your earliest convenience. Thanks.

Brenda,  

In talking with Chris he was able to round up these newly signed deal customers as having the 90/110 band terms included in their contracts. (See customers in email from Chris)

In addition when checking with others in the EES organization regarding the old contracts he was told that most of the older contracts which have been in place from 1997 to current have the band terms included in them as well.  

I would think that our best bet is to get together with project Phoenix resources and see if we can get examples of contracts which are handled by each of the settlement resources we have. (CSC, Avista, Enron?)

Let me know if you wish for me to drive this forward or if you have it covered.  

FYI?I will be in Houston next week. 8/6 - 8/10.

Thanks - MO

I agree with Mark that this functionality does not exist today. However, I =
don't see developing a solution will be that hard.  There are very few cont=

to make this sound easy.  We still need to get the input information.  Thes=
e deals will be more of the Interval meter data transactions which will hav=
e a hourly load shape and we can get access to the hourly index price.  I h=
ave access to that information today. =20

We do need to get a solution in place quickly.  I don't want to speak for h=
im but I think Mark was saying that they would not have a solution in place=
 win the current tactical solution.  I do think that we can add something o=
utside of that process which will be added back in manually at first.

I am copying Chris on this as well so he can start taking a look at it.  Th=
is is the type of activity we perform on a daily basis in the Portland offi=
ce.  There may be something which we can replicate

Please see the below contractual language and Mark Denner's response.  I wa=

 Home Depot CA is a specific example of this deal structure.=20

Below you will find a copy of a deal I discussed with Orig.  I would like to see the standard  be the following until we have your project in production.

Settle with customers at least quarterly, and on a calendar month basis.

If you have any questions please let me know.

I just spoke with Murray O'Neil from the Operations group in charge of the whole billing of consumption band issue.

He is okay from an operational point of view with letting this cut both ways for this deal.   He did raise a cash flow concern regarding doing the settlement on an annual basis.  Murray suggested that we settle at the end of the first contract year for each of the months, but after the first contract year, that we go to a monthly settlement.

Michelle - can you generate some language that captures this structure?

Edith - I am assuming the the desk is still okay with the consumption bands cutting both ways.   Please let me know ASAP if you have an issue.

Murray - Please let me know if you have any issue with how I have represented our conversation and conclusion.

Erling/Mallik - Have you been able to determine if there will be any change to the consumption premium for letting the excess/deficiency cut both ways?  Please let us know as soon as possible.

Jim/Michelle,

Excess/Deficiency

The Excess/Deficiency is in the process of being approved.     We will have to add some sort of language to indicate how we are going to settle (ie. at the end of the year).

This is a clause from the Boston Properties contract that we included for the Excess and Deficiency:

If such amount is a positive number, Customer shall pay that amount to EESI.  If such amount is a negative number, EESI shall credit such amount to Customer.  The amounts due under this Section 2.2.1 shall be calculated for each month, and the Parties shall net and settle all amounts due under this Section annually within 60 days of the end of each Contract Year. 


Rescind Rights

The previous CA contracts had bilateral right to rescind.   But given that CA is shut down, if we have unilateral right to rescind we have a greater probability of getting the deal through the desk.

Chris S. indicated that although we might not be able to get the wire transfers out this week, we could at least set up the payments this week for payment on Monday.  That is what I am communicating to the clients.  Please let me know when Chris S. has the data he needs to set up payments.

Delano:  All hours for the Month

Arco:   All hours January 1 - 17
Wheelabrator Martell:  January 1-17
Wheelabrator Shasta:  THey have PX activity from 1/10 - 1/17.

Thanks

Chris

Suzanne,

I think we have a meeting schedule for tomorrow 10/2.  I am including a list of questions in the email and am hopeful that we can go over them in our meeting.

1)	Would it be possible to get an overview of the ROC (Retail Operation Center)?
a.	What are their responsibilities
b.	When will they be available to support the business

2)	The Process for paying generators on a net 10 day basis is not currently a sound repeatable process.  (Is it possible to reword this in the contract?)

3)	Do we have locations to store?:
a.	Operational costs by deal (Generator/Unit)
b.	Pricing tiers by deal (Will they stay standard in each market 25% then 50% at fixed targets
c.	Generation Meter data specific to servicing EES
i.	If there is no meter data available, is the method to calculate generation volumes a standardized calculation and documented in the contract.

4)	Is the expectation that EWS/Settlements will be responsible for Invoicing / Paying (Netting) generators or is this a function which a portion can be outsourced (Avista receiving invoice from Generator)?

5)	Who is warring congestion risk if energy can't be delivered?

6)	What are the expected reporting tools back to the Generator?  It would be cost effective is we can come up with one standard reporting tool back to the Generators.

7)	If Energy is not delivered (Non-Performance by Generator) who is responsible for penalties associated.

8)	What process is in place to address market price changes?:
a.	Changing Market prices after market closed / settled.
b.	Do we need a secondary index noted in the contract.
c.	What language is in the contract to allow from and address pricing zone material changes

The list above should get us all started.

I hope we can cover all of these in our time together.

Thanks - MO

Hi Murray.  I am working closely with Victor Gonzalez and Tom Blanks, and they are both familiar with the DG product.  A majority of the questions you asked below concern functions that will be handled by Fred Kelley or Lloyd Will in the Retail Operations Center (ROC).  I put my response to your questions in red below.  Please let me know what day and time is convenient for you to meet and I'll reserve time.

Thanks Murray,

Suzanne,

I have taken a look at your proposals and it looks like a very attractive product.  There are a few items I'm going to need to research to determine our ability to quickly turn a settlement solution around.  I do not know of any internal automated processes to support the type of billing you are proposing in your deal.  Which mean that everything would be manual.  

This type of settlement is something which is similar to settlement calculations we have performed in our wholesale business in the west.  However.  To feel comfortable that we can settle these deals in the quick turn around time which you have identified (10 days following the end of the month).

I do have a few questions which I would like to discuss with you next week (9/24 - 9/26).

Will we install meters at each facility to ensure we have real-time access to generation / curtailment data? The ROC will install interval meters on each of the DG assets.  We may or may not be able to access the data in reat time.  For LC, we will use a baseline calculation.
Who are you anticipating will install the meters and perform the MDMA function? The ROC
Will each contract have the utility / control area market price identified in the contract (Actual Publication being used in settlements)? Yes.  For example, our initial target market is New York Zones J and G.  We will settle with the customer off of the NYISO hourly posted clearing price for the respective zone.
For invoicing the Generator, Where will the Operation cost be derived from and will it be stated in the contract? The Generator will receive a fixed payment for every MWh they run.  This payment is intended to cover O&M and fuel expenses and it will remain fixed over the life of the contract.

This is the start of my questions.  As I review your proposal further, I'm sure I will have some more.

Thanks - MO

Subject:        90/110 Consumption Bands

Details regarding EES/CSC deal capture and billing for 90/110 consumption bands -

Power

EWS Business Contact - Richard Miller

Deal Capture Status - Information is not included on any CSC power deal tickets (deal sheets)

Risk Book Status - Currently not captured - A.K. Matheson is researching and will provide details

Gas

EWS Business Contact - Lisa McClendon

Deal Capture Status - Information is included on CSC gas deal tickets (deal sheets)

Risk Book Status - Currently captured

Billing Status - CSC does know which customers bands apply to - currently applying bands to some gas customer bills, but process performed manually

        ==>  Lisa has been working with CSC this week to determine the following -

                - How many gas deals do bands apply to?

                - How is CSC tracking penalties by meter and by billing period?

                - What is total $ amount of penalties?

                - What is the estimated unbilled penalty amount and what is CSC's plan to resolve on a go-forward basis?

I will forward additional information as it becomes available.

Thanks,

James

Brenda,

Sorry about not getting something out to you yesterday.  Chris Stokley was trying to get some additional information back from some folks in Houston.  We got quite a bit of information yesterday and have the draft almost completed.  We will get you something to review by your 2:30pm time frame.

Do you want it via email?  Let me know if there is someone other than yourself you want me to send it to so they can get it printed out for you.

Here is the data model and data flow diagram for MDMA.  

  

I am trying to find out if the data from MV90 get interfaced into MDMA on a daily basis
or not.  If it is done on a daily basis, then I don't think there is a need to go into MV90.
MV90 will have raw data and will not have gone through validations which are performed
in MDMA.

Well,  Here I am 10 days later trying to get caught up on my email.  If you have something like this in the future which you need me to respond to.  Please make sure that you are placing a call to me as well as sending the email.  I don't have much time to stay up with my email when I'm receiving over 100 new emails a day.

I was talking with Scott Mills and Brenda Herod about them going to OH.  If we have everything they need in the Ranger project they would not need to go.  In order to provide them with what they need out of project Ranger, we may be required to change some of the priorities.

I am interested in seeing what they are trying to get from CSC prior to making any recommendations.

Murray -

The Gas project is planning a visit next week of 2 to 3 staff at the CSC
office in Dublin, OH.  We are trying to gauge the value in doing the same on
the Power side.  The purpose of their visit is to analyze billing data and
hold discussions with personnel up there to better understand the billing
process as a whole.  On the Power end, it may serve us well to do this so
that we can make some more contacts at CSC and build up some knowledge of
CSC billing for future reference.

I have spoken with Chris Stokley about this, and he suggested that we go to
you for you opinion on go/no-go.  What are your thoughts?

I don't own that application in the FSP/VMS world (at least for now).

The Meter Scout will have to be re-written to handle the new procedures.

Overview
The California ISO is enhancing two of its meter data systems, scheduled to
be in production by October 2001.  The objective of this development effort
is to provide the ISO with robust, flexible, maintainable, and more

Production Implementation	October 1

Impacts of project
	*	New interface for MDAS-Online
			o	Same look and feel as new OASIS interface
	*	Multiple valid file formats
			o	MDEF and CSV file formats for meter data
submission and requests
	*	No longer use FTP to submit MDEF files
			o	Interim FTP service for file submission
during transition
			o	File submission only, no FTP
acknowledgements or requests
	*	Automation specification will be provided
			o	Submission of meter data file
			o	Download of meter data file submission
status
			o	Download of meter data
	*	Additional equipment and software
			o	Smart Card security
			o	Netscape Navigator browser
	*	ECN connection no longer required for meter data submission
and requests
			o	The file submission and reporting will take
place over a secure internet connection
	*	No formal training required
			o	Online help in application
			o	MDAS Operators
			o	System Support


Questions will be addressed at the next TSWG Conference call (6/26/01 @1330
PST) or send inquiries to Leslie Feusi at Lfeusi@caiso.com.

For Rexam be sure that you recognize that when Rexam exceeds 110% of its Baseline consumption, Rexam is billed for the entire excess volume above the Baseline multiplied by the Basis adjustment.  See Section 5.2.4 of the original contract.

Brenda--

Correction.  Per Section 5.2.4 there is a 90/110 band around around all gas and electricity consumption for Rexam.

Apologies for the mistake,

Andy

Springs Industries

Please note that I've asked Chris Leinauer in Baseline to perform a comparison of actual vs. baseline consumption for this transaction.

Consumption band language can be found in Schedule 3.6, "Adjustment Process" of this contract.  Section 1.4 pertains to Retail electricity sites and Section 1.5 pertains to Wholesale electricity and Discount gas sites.  Non-Discount gas sites are not subject to a consumption band.  Note that, while the commercial intent of the contract is for EES to directly serve gas to Discount gas sites, in fact EES is currently not serving gas to one Discount site (Middleton) and is serving a Non-Discount site (Griffin Finishing).

If annual consumption at any gas or electric site is more than +/- 15% of the baseline, then a Material Change is deemed to have occurred.  If the circumstances which have caused the Material Change will continue for at least 270 days, then the Material Change will be deemed Permanent.  If the circumstances last less than 270 days, then the Material Change will be deemed Temporary.

For Retail sites, Material Changes that result in consumption level changes more than the greater of $25,000 or 10% of the baseline spending will require an Adjustment to be agreed upon by both parties.

For Wholesale electricity and Discount gas sites, in the event of a Temporary Material Change, Excess or Deficiency Volumes in the Contract Year will be calculated based on how much more actual consumption is above or below 10% of the baseline.  Wholesale sites subject to Index Pricing (i.e., subsequent to Deregulation) and Discount gas facilities will pay a true-up on Excess or Deficiency Volumes equal to the difference between contract price and market price.  Note that for electricity only the Montgomery Site is currently post-Deregulation and subject to the true-up.

In the event of a Permanent Material Change, a true-up will be paid as per the Temporary Material Change above and Cover Damages will be assessed, per Schedule 8.3.2.3.6.

Rexam (American National Can)

There is a cap of 110% of baseline volumes for Deregulated states (AZ, IL, NJ) and for Deregulating states prior to Deregulation (SC, GA, TX, OK, IN, NC).  There is no consumption band for gas facilities we serve, Deregulating states after Deregulation, and California.  Volumes consumed in excess of the cap are charged the "Deregulated Electricity Price" equal to applicable wholesale index plus fixed basis.

Please contact me at x5-8998 if you have further questions,

Regards,

Andy

Operations (Brenda Herod) is attempting to complete an analysis on EES billing performance on all contracts that contain consumption bands.  Her goal is to highlight those agreements with bands and ensure that EES has billed the customer correctly.

At this point a central location for information of this type does not exist so she was hoping we could provide information on what we have found to date.  Can you each please provide information to me on consumption bands in the contracts you have reviewed.  (See the list below)  Please send this to me as quickly as possible, Brenda has asked for it by this afternoon if possible.

Jim, the above settlement files were misstated due to an error in tracking

normal load for a weekday while 5/28 reflected the load for a weekend. 
The problem has been corrected and the files for 5/26 and 5/28 were

Brenda,

Yesterday, 6/27/01 when we were in the meeting with Jay Lewis, you had a document which I believe contained a list of all of the issues to date.  I think you referenced the document as being something which was put together by Paige Grgrumulaitis.  Can you please forward myself & Chris Stokley a copy of that document.

In addition, it would be beneficial to these efforts if you could add us to any distribution lists which have already been established or will be established in the future  for scheduling meetings, distributing communications?  

It would be helpful if you could provide us with any documentation which we may have been previously distributed. We are looking for any documentation that references process and / or systems for EES current or future state.
I currently have two documents from the Gutenberg team:  
 1 - ("Gutenberg "Is" and "Should" cross-functional process maps")
 2 - ("Gutenberg Calculation Engine Project - Phase I) dated May 25, 2001.  

There are many activities currently underway in this transition, and I am making these requests in hopes that we can prevent people from trying to reinvent the wheel or performing redundant activities.  

Any assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks - MO

I've attached the preliminary Product Approval Template for the new physical delivery product for ComEd for your review.  There are a number of actions currently underway for product finalization, e.g. contracts and load profile approval.  Beginning Wednesday morning a notional pricing matrix will be located on Market Central.  The following overview provides a product description and value assessment: 
 
Product
Illinois (ComEd) Physical Delivery Product - $/MWh discount to prevailing bundled rate (PBR) Rate 6 or 6L through February 28, 2002, followed by a fixed price for retail generation beginning March 1, 2002.
Fixed price includes energy, congestion, and losses; ICAP, ancillary services, T&D and other UDC-related charges are passed through to customer. 
The product passes through ancillary services primarily because of market power by incumbent UDC  and lack of an ISO.
Physical delivery is approved for ComEd March 1, 2002, with maximum allowable load set at 25 MWs by EWS Logistics.  Once max. load is contracted, reassessment of the cap will follow.

Contract
Currently under development (Mini, Mid) - Target date of COB 9/20, with Master to follow.

 

Regards,
Marcus Dotson

	Even,

	Who do I need to contact to see a copy of the current Enron to CSC project request log.
The current project log for CSC projects is on the CSC/EES information exchange web site at this url - <http://csc-enronix/chg_req/IT_Projects.pdf>
	Do we have a listing which contains the following information:

	Request description

	Requestor

	Date of request

	Quantifiable justification for request

	Cost to Enron for CSC to do the request

	Enron's priority of request

	Enron's preferred date of completion

	CSC targeted date of completion.

	CSC current status (% complete)
Most of the above information is contained in the report referenced up above.  The remaining information may be found in the actual request itself, which is maintained, along with all associated correspondence, amendments, approvals, etc., in a soft library my group manages on the J: drive.
	Is there a formal reporting process of these requests and is there a group who manages the priorities to make sure they are in-line with the current business needs.

  
My group manages the request process and ensures adherence to the Work Request Guidelines.  Priorities for projects are determined based on the requested delivery date.  If a new request has a delivery date that causes problems with the completion of other existing projects, then the owners of the conflicting requests are contacted to rearrange project completion dates and reset expectations.  Additionally, we hold a monthly Executive Project Status review where all requestors can conference in and discuss issues related to their projects.
	Can you also tell me if CSC is off on their cost estimate for doing a project does Enron get billed actual project cost or just estimated costs
We are billed actuals, however there is an agreement that we will only pay overruns up to 15% of the project cost (almost all projects are IT in nature and we feel this is a fair margin in estimation error).  My group is responsible for validating charges on the invoice, and we monitor the charged project costs.  We will negotiate overruns on a project-by-project basis as they occur.  We also perform a function up front of cost haggling on estimates if requested, or if we note something unusual.

Brenda,
 
I agree with your proposal to only have one location to store metered consumption information.  
 
Project Ranger has always been presented to me as a project focused on getting meter data out of the CSC systems for those customers who have already been settled.   I am still trying to get my hands on a copy of the requirements for project Ranger so I have a better understanding of what the request to CSC contained and to determine what the plans are if any for the information once it is inside Enron's network.
 
The purpose for our meeting on Tuesday, (Today) is to determine methods of accessing real-time consumption information and making that available to the Intramonth book and if possible improve estimates associated with all transmission costs.  This meter information is in now way settlement quality and will be replaced with meter data which has gone through a VEE process as the utilities make it available.
 
As for combining efforts.  I'm all for it.  I have been asking to be a participant in this process for the past 4 weeks and have not received any documentation or notification of meetings regarding project Ranger.  In an effort to ensure that we are getting real-time information as a starting point we have been moving forward.  I would have to say that this information should be part of the overall request going to CSC and anyone else working on gathering utility settlement information.
 
At this point in time I'm not sure that everyone who needs to be included in the meeting today can be available.  So,  I recommend that we move forward with the separate meetings and work to combine efforts on a go forward basis.  I will try and summarize the outcome and next steps of today's meeting and pass it on to you.
 
If you need to get in contact with me please call my cell 503-702-9846.
 
Thanks - MO

As part of Project Ranger, it is my goal to have a single repository to house all actual data, allowing users to access data through an ad hoc reporting tool.  Additionally, as areas identify needs, I would hope that we can develop feeds rather than just ad hoc reporting.
 
We are setting up a meeting with CSC for this Wednesday to discuss the needs and start defining Iteration 2 of the project.  Vivian forwarded me this meeting that you have already set-up.  My question:  Without knowing the full scope of your efforts, I'd like to propose a single initiative to obtain actuals.  Additionally, we wanted to set-up this meeting for Wednesday when the CSC business analyst is in town.  Do you think it would be advantageous to combine the meetings, and schedule it for Wednesday?  
 
We will move forward with our efforts and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.  If you all want to combine efforts, please let me know and we will include you on the meeting.
 
Chris - I had already included both you and Murray on the invitation listing.  Will you forward this E-mail to him?  I'm having problems trying to call up his E-mail address.
 
Please let me know.

Kenny Ha who works for Anthony is already setting a meeting with the Portland guys on this.
Should you just attend this meeting or do you still want to have a separate meeting.  Kevin
Crippen is not going to be in until Wednesday though.

I think we need to get the Real-time and services desk, as well as the ST-cal desk together to talk about this.

What are your thoughts on the impact?

Subject:	CAISO Notification - Supplemental Market Notice Regarding Impleme	ntation of FERC's May 25, 2001 Order

Supplemental Market Notice
Regarding Implementation of FERC's May 25, 2001 Order

On May 26, 2001, the ISO sent out a Market Notice explaining its
implementation of FERC's May 25, 2001 Order (Order Providing Clarification
and Preliminary Guidance, 95 FERC ? 61,275).  The May 26 Market Notice noted
that FERC accepted the ISO's proposal to substitute a $0/MWh bid for all
available capacity that is not bid into the ISO's Imbalance Energy market
and for which either the ISO has not received heat and emission rate
information or the information is not complete.
Under the price mitigation proposal contained in FERC's April 26, 2001 and
May 25, 2001 Orders, generation owners selling into the ISO's markets or
transmitting power over the ISO Controlled Grid have the responsibility to
bid in any available capacity into the real-time Imbalance Energy market.
As noted above, if such capacity is not bid into the Imbalance Energy
market, the ISO has the authority to create price taker bids for any
non-hydro resource that has available capacity.   Such price-taker bids will
be created by either expanding a submitted Supplemental Energy bid to
include the unbid capacity or creating a Supplemental Energy bid of $0 value
for that unbid capacity.

Although the ISO has not started inserting the $0 price-taker bids, the ISO
will begin  doing so for Trade Day June 6, 2001.  For resources in which
available capacity can not be calculated in real-time due to the lack of
relevant information (e.g., resources with significant load behind the meter
for which there is no telemetry or separate metering of load and generation
or resources that are scheduled on aggregated basis), the ISO will not be
inserting price-taker bids.

Resources for which available capacity can not be calculated in real-time
generally include Qualifying Facilities ("QFs") under Public Utilities
Regulatory Policy Act of 1978.  On May 16, 2001, the FERC issued an Order
granting, in part, motions for emergency relief filed by entities
representing QFs, see, 95 FERC ? 61,226.  The FERC authorized the sales of
"excess" QF power at negotiated rates provided that the power is sold to
serve load in California. The FERC stated that excess QF sales may be made
pursuant to either bilateral contracts at negotiated rates, or may be bid
into the  ISO's real-time market.  If the QFs choose the real-time market,
the FERC required the QFs to be price-takers.

The ISO notes that in all cases where it does not have adequate information
to calculate available capacity, the owners still have the responsibility to
bid in all available capacity under FERC's Orders.

All,

I am sending this document out to ensure that everyone knows what is required to process EPMI's Hanson Cement deal.  It is possible after reviewing all of the handoffs, that EPMI and EWS (Retail Generation) will wish to handle this deal in a different method.  

We need to come to some decisions very quickly.  There is a tremendous amount of coordination which needs to occur in order to service Hanson Cement.

Everyone please review responsibilities and let me know your comments.   

 

I will be working out of the Houston office this week.  The best way to contact me is via Cell @ 503-702-9846.

Subject:	invoicing requirements

Murray,
Pursuant to our discussion this morning, inclusive in this email are the detail behind a proposed method of invoicing a potential customer.  Jim Wood and I discussed a product idea for invoicing the customer based on areas aggregations by congestion zones - as determined by the regional ISO and UDC region, and as define in the contract.  This is similar to our current practices of invoicing the customer based on their internal regional alignment.  Also, inclusive in the invoice would be an additional charge (when applicable) when the customer's consumption falls below 90% or goes above 110% of their baseline usage.  The difference from current practices is that this additional charge (credit) would be assessed to the region and not to an individual site/account for this customer.  The question is, can Operations handle this type of billing method and if so, is there a potential additional cost for processing the invoice?

Thank you in advance for your expedient assistance,
Victor Gonzalez

To all: 

Attached is our first stab at a more detailed listing of all of the efforts which are ongoing in the operations area with owners, proposed deadlines, IT dependencies and some more detailed comments.  It is trying to tie in quite a few moving parts, so there is a lot of info on these few pages.  Hopefully still "readable".

The document also attempts to cross reference all of the various projects out there (Ranger, Genysis, Gas Solution......) -- so we all understand how these projects affect all of the initiatives that we have underway.  We will also be setting up consistent project management documentation to individually track each of the cross functional projects - to ensure that they do not impact the detailed Operations initiatives.

I intend to use this listing to control all of the Operations efforts, and as a tool to update you all on our progress (weekly initially - and then we will see what is needed).

This is a "living and breathing" document which we will be constantly adding to, as new initiatives become active and others are completed.  

For those of you who will be at the EES/EWS offsite next week, I will plan to walk thru, and for others that attend the Thursday Causey/Buy meeting will also review it's intension there.

Even,

Who do I need to contact to see a copy of the current Enron to CSC project request log.

Do we have a listing which contains the following information:

Request description
Requestor
Date of request
Quantifiable justification for request
Cost to Enron for CSC to do the request
Enron's priority of request
Enron's preferred date of completion
CSC targeted date of completion.
CSC current status (% complete)

Is there a formal reporting process of these requests and is there a group who manages the priorities to make sure they are in-line with the current business needs.

Can you also tell me if CSC is off on their cost estimate for doing a project does Enron get billed actual project cost or just estimated costs?

Any information you can provide related to this request would be appreciated.

Thanks - MO

Alan,

This is a very valid question and one which was asked by Steve Hall about 6 weeks ago.  We have been working with the ISO the get the following information.

Based on the latest information provided by the ISO Client Reps.  Enron would be eligible for receiving part of the Allocation.  There were some questions regarding this in the past because, the tariff was written in our favor to receive part of this allocation but the Settlement documentation by the ISO did not represent the same.

Per John Gooden at the ISO

The CT 1480 is used to allocate the revenues received by the ISO through CT 480.  Such revenues will be allocated to the SCs with a positive Uninstructed Demand Deviation and to those with a negative Uninstructed Demand Deviation with a magnitude less than or equal to 5% of the metered Demand.  These SCs will receive revenues based on the ratio of each SC's metered demand to the sum of all such SCs metered demand in the control area.

Chris Stokley has placed a request with the ISO to provide us with information indicating how much of this has been allocated to Enron.  If they are truly calculating this today they should not have any problems providing this information.

If you have any additional questions please let me know.

Thanks - MO

Subject:	Underscheduling Penalty--CONFIDENTIAL

The Calif. EOB has released information on the size of the FERC-approved, tracked, but-as-yet-unimplemented underscheduling penalty.

See the attached PDF file, especially the figures in the attachment at the end.

The total liability for PG&E and SCE is approaching $1billion. (EOB says that DWR is off the hook but I am not sure that is true.)

As a generally balanced SC, Enron would likely be eligible for some of these proceeds.  How the proceeds would be allocated is less than fully clear.  MURRAY O'NEIL: Have you seen anything on who would receive the revenues from this tracking A/C if it were to be billed and paid?)

Also the probability of ever extracting these $s out of noncreditworthy counter parties must be taken into account.

I was reviewing the data dump request from Scott to Todd Taylor and wondered if this was sufficient for the settlement side of this project.  We have only requested usage for 2001 and I would believe that we would need usage information for 97 to 00.  Are we getting this from another source?  Should we stop the current request and modify or can we add this to the database with the next RPS dump request?  Any thoughts would be appreciated.

We still need to have one TS which has no timeout on it.  I will estimate and say that we will need this for another 3 weeks.  We have gotten a lot of work done over the past month but still have about 3 months remaining to actualize.

If you have any questions please give me a call.

Andrew,

As discussed numerous times in the past, the Volume Management terminal server utilization / demands change frequently.  The Volume Management team has been directed by the application development group to re-run all of the reconciliation tools for September-00 through January-01.  For some reason when running this tool over the past two week the tool is taking exceptionally long.  It used to take 20 - 30 min to run for one day.  It has been known to take up to 2 hours during the last couple of weeks to complete one day.  On the average when we have to re-run for a month we don't run it day by day.  However, the amount of time required is still in excess of 2 or 3 hr window provided.  These job will take anywhere from 6 to 10 hr for an entire month. 

The dollar amounts associated with the settlements which need to be recalculated and distributed are in excess of $70 mil.  and our customers are growing inpatient in receiving their money.

Please remove the terminal server restriction on at least one of the terminal servers through 4/27/01.  If all goes well we should be successful in completing our efforts by then.

In the future when contacted by Dave Steiner with a request like this it, would be appreciated if you would take action without requesting a email from me.  We discussed with Dave what was needed and I see where someone in Houston made the decision that this was not an emergency.  Until that individual knows what is happening in our office on a real-time basis (Like Dave Does), I feel they should let the West Power Desk make that decision.  The Application Integration group can support us by helping us meet the objectives rather then act as an additional hurdle.

If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.  My cell number is 503-702-9846.

	Eddie, 
        The immediate issue is that our Volume Management Group run almost exclusively through Term Serv.  The processes they run far longer than the time out allows (they are getting bumped off due to some inactivity time limit).  They have a very critical need to have this limit extended or removed.  I don't know if we can by user, machine or even at all? 

	Please let me know 

	Regards

All,

I have included Steve Nat on this email so he too can be up to pace with our discussions.

I have almost completed reviewing everything I have received from you.  I would like to schedule a meeting to talk again tomorrow.

I am having an AT&T Conf. Call scheduled for 1pm Pacific Time tomorrow.  If I recall correctly, we agreed on our last call that we would attempt to have follow-up on Friday about the same time as our call on Wednesday.  (I will forward the call information as soon as our admin has it set up)

Up to this point I have not seen anything which concerns me regarding functionality of VMS, and Power Meter Data DB.  I do however hove some questions and concerns regarding some of the fundamentals of how Enron will / is participating in the market and from a P&L perspective how will things be reported?

Q1 - What is the upside to being in the Alberta Retail Market and how will this be valued and where will it be actualized?
Q2 - Who will be supporting the standard business functions in the Calgary office for the Retail Market activity? (Forecasting, Trade Capture,  Volume Management, Settlements, Customer Service and Financial Reporting)
Q3 - Is there a standard FTP established for all of the electronic files being distributed through out the participants?
Q4 - What is driving the September 1 implementation date?
Q5 - Is the Calgary office going to attempt to perform services for any of the other components of the WSP's (MSM's, LSA's, MDM's or Tariff Calculation)?
Q6 - Has anyone looked at the Retail billing system which is currently in the EES shop?
Q7 - Is anyone in the Application development / Support Group in Houston (Beth Perlman's World) involved in assisting Calgary with identifying solutions for the Retail Market?
Q8 - How many different billing cycles will Enron Canada have with their Retail customers (Will you maintain the billing cycle which each customer is already on?)
Q9 - Is there a scheduling requirement with this Retail Market?  (I would think that you are going to need to provide a link between Wholesale Purchases and Retail Usage / billing)
Q10 - Is there additional information regarding Customer Information System (CIS) Requirements.  I see where you need to be able to store Site information, Enrolling information, Energizing & De-Energizing.  What about billing cycles, Equal pay plans, Contact information?


My observations based on documentation and the Wednesday phone conversation:
					
	Pros	Cons	
VMS	Can support all of the tariff calculations documented.  We are also in the process of implementing the dispute management function of VMS.  VMS manages transactions by exception.  We estimate what the charge should come out to then validate that against statements from WSP then dispute the exceptions)	Resources Available to assist with Implementation	
Power Meter Data DB	Should be able to hold all meter data activity	Resources Available to assist with Implementation	
PMI	(Public Market Information) Appears to fit into current structures	Resources Available to assist with Implementation	
CIS / Site profile	EES Peace Software tool has functionality built in	I don't currently know that status of this tool and what it would take to set up for your market	
Load Profiling /  Scheduling	Required?	?	
Deal / Trade Capture	Required?	?	
Billing	EES Peace Software tool has functionality built in	I don't currently know that status of this tool and what it would take to set up for your market Unify would require Integration with EnPower and all global tables. Resources may be an issue.	
Delivery Point Management 	Global Facility already has the base functionality needed	Implementation may require some software / DB changes. Resources may be an issue	
Contract Management	Global Contracts already has the base functionality needed	Implementation will require addition DB & software changes. Resources may be an issue	

I hope that we can answer a number of the questions and validate your approach to participating in the Alberta Retail market tomorrow on your call.

Here are the teleconference details.

Neal,

Do we already have access to the RT prices they are talking about?  Does EPMI have them and is it something we can use?

Jason,  I could not find Victor in the address book to forward this on.  Can you please make sure he gets this.

Victor,  Please coordinate with Patti Thompson.  She is handling my schedule currently.  

Thanks - MO

Murray,
Tom Blanks and I met with Gillian Johnson, part of EES structuring/origination, to discuss electricity billing issues in the Maryland market.  This market requires UDC consolidated billing and our sales group is requesting real time pricing.  The current potential in this market is approximately 400 accounts.
To that end, we need to discuss with you the billings options to comply with the above request.  One issue that Jason and I discussed was the cost associated with the setup of real time pricing - and how to properly price for cost recovery.

Tom and I (and maybe Jason) would like to meet with you to discuss options.  Please let  me know you availability.

Thanks,
Victor

Subject:	MD Billing Issues

As a follow up to our conversation, for Schedule P customers, I currently envision a scenario where we will go with UDC consolidated billing and send a monthly check to customers to cover the incentive payment based on the anticipated usage stipulated in the contract.  If the customer pushes back on using anticipated usage and insists on the greater of actual or anticipated, we will inform Origination that they will have to take a margin hit to cover the true up costs in order to manage this scenario.  We would likely just do one true up in July 2002 or quarterly, if necessary.  This applies to both the index and fixed retail gen products.

The additional issues around the index product are related to gathering the data necessary to bill a "real time" product.  BGE provides suppliers access to something called "Interval Load Data Access Service" for a cost of $1/customer account/month.  I do not know in what form we will receive this data but if I were to guess, they will provide us with access to a website.  From our conversation, I do not believe that this is ideal for you based on your current processes.  There is a possibility that they can provide it via EDI.  Could you please confirm how you prefer to receive data?

Another issue is related to the hourly, daily or monthly pricing data that must also be gathered to compile an aggregated price.  We have asked for some input from the desk on both the product and the billing issues.  I will keep you in the loop on the response.  I am also eager to meet with Murray so that we can get an estimate of what our price would be if it is necessary for the EWS Billing Operations group to coordinate the gathering of all of this data instead of the desk.

Lastly, I think that the issue of the number of lines allowed on the BGE bill is not a concern.  I quote from the BGE Electricity Supplier Manual below.  

"Bill Image Requirements: 
supplier's name is limited  to 28 characters
there is no defined limit to the number of billing determinants the supplier can send (should the number of bill pages exceed BGE's mail weight limit, Supplier Acct Mgmt (BGE) will contact the supplier to determine a resolution
the description of the billing determinant is limited to 18 characters
supplier rates are limited to 8 characters
..."

Bob and I look forward to getting a meeting set up with Murray O'Neil as quickly as possible.  We will be doing a direct mail campaign and our Origination efforts begin in earnest next week so we are eager to get this second product on the list of available products as quickly as possible and must get these billing issues resolved ASAP.

Thanks for your help in getting this resolved!

Gillian

Murray, thanks for your interest in leveraging the Gutenberg work.  Here's the draft Overview.  The visio documents are not the most current, but I've asked the consultants to produce a binder this morning and also e-mail you all of the most current process flows as well as the Pricing and Booking disconnect detail you requested.

I 'd like very much to learn more how you would see expediting progress through the EWS processes and tools, and hope you'll work with us as soon as possible to see what might be possible.

Subject:	Aggregation Deals

In recent meetings regarding the development of our aggregation book of business, there have been issues raised that will have a direct impact on Operations as we move ahead with these deals.  My concern surrounds scalability.  We appear to be introducing concepts that may not be aligned with the approach to have low-touch billing which can be completed with an automated process.

First, the contracts include a 110% consumption band with amounts in excess of this band being charged to the entities contributing to the excess.  Operations needs to have access to both the current and baseline monthly data in order to complete this calculation.  Further, the consumption needs to be allocated to those members contributing to the excess and a price applied for invoicing.

Second, the aggregators RFP's all call for EES to collect their fee and remit it back to them.  There are different methods of determining this amount, as addressed in a separate email copied to you, and this too requires Operations resources.

Third, pricing settlement calculations call for the comparison of weighted average hourly index charge versus the EES contract rate for the month.  This data would be available from the Baseline group, and the information exchange process needs to be clearly spelled.

Finally, a savings report that compares the PTB in Texas to the contract rate needs to be developed.  We have been able to get across the message that a report is better than the need to show savings on the invoice.  Again, the information exchange process and the manpower needs have to be developed.

Let me know who is the best contact person in your group, and we will keep you up to date on these issues.

Thanks,
Arthur

Subject:	CAISO Notice - Additional Payments on November 2000 Invoice


		ISO Market Participants:

		On Friday, February 8, 2001, the ISO received payments from
certain parties that had defaulted (either in part or whole) on their
previous obligations to the ISO, due on February 2, 2001 (based on the
November 2000 preliminary invoices).

		As a result of these payments the total funds which became
available for distribution to Market Participants were $149,333,046.54.  The
ISO instructed its bank to distribute pro rata payments on Friday based on
this amount.

		The ISO distributed these payments in accordance with ISO
Tariff Section 11 and Settlements and Billing Protocol ("SABP") Section 6.

		A reconciliation of amounts received with the amount
distributed follows:

Payments Received:
California Power Exchange	$ 149,349,573.52
Koch Energy Trading	$              331.73
Interest on ISO Reserve Account	 $              793.35
Subtotal	 $ 149,350,698.60

Less:
Interest Cost on Previous Borrowings on Market Line of Credit	 $
17,652.06

Total Distributed 2/9/2001	 $ 149,333,046.54

The ISO applied payments due to Market Participants under this distribution
to first extinguish any outstanding obligations, consistent with SABP 6.10.4
and 6.10.2:

		SABP 6.10.4
			The ISO shall apply payments received in respect of
amounts owing to ISO Creditors to repay the relevant debts in the order of
the creation of such debts.

		SABP 6.10.2
			The ISO is authorized to recoup, set off and apply
any amount, which any defaulting ISO Debtor is or will be entitled, in or
towards the satisfaction of any of that ISO Debtor's debts arising under the
ISO Settlement and billing process.  Each ISO Creditor and each ISO Debtor
expressly acknowledges that the oldest outstanding amounts will be settled
first in the order of the creation of such debts.

Everyone should have access to the Global application.  (Global Counterparty, Global Facility, Global Contracts, Global Common Codes).  You should be able to find them under your start menu (See below).

If for some reason you do not has access to all of them you will need to put in a security request, requesting them.  In addition to the production application you should also have access to the Test and REP Test applications for each.  (These test applications can be found through your start menu as well under Programs>Development application>Global>

With the implementation of VMS our data processing is directly integrated with these global tables.  All Location, Customer, SE, SA...  will be driven from these tables.

Jeff,

Based on what I have seen in the detail to this point.  The primary reason for the big hits have been due to what appears to be penalty charges associated to under scheduling.  When Enron De-DASR'ed all of the customers back to the utility in Jan.  EES was not including them in their schedule.  However, the customers were not yet physically moved back over to the utility until a later date.   

The title on this $40MM  has been Ancillary Services.  This is not a true representation of what is being discussed.  We are actually talking about all Market Transmission charges which have been allocated to EES based on their physical load.

The big hits in the months in question are more related to Neutrality/Penalty charges related to A/S.

At this point I have only spend about 1hr looking at the detail.  Chris Stokley will be working with the EES Retail Volume Management group and EPMI Volume Management group today to have them look into a couple of questions regarding detail.

We should have an update for everyone by Friday to let you know the primary reasons flash to actual variance and lateness of reporting.

As for when and what should be reported as a DPR adjustment.
When:  Jeff and Tim need to talk about when they want to see this hit.
What:   We have already disputed these periods with the ISO.  There will be no additional disputes on these settlements.  The only thing which may change to impact these $'s is the fact that the ISO is in the process of recalculating 10/00 - 6/01 and the Market rate will be less most likely when EES was short.  This should have a positive impact on what would be booked today.

If you have any questions please let me know.

Jeff - We will not know whether this will be included in 3Q until late this week or early next week.  We would like to know whether any of these charges will be disputed with the ISO which would give us some ability to defer to 4Q.  

Murray - Can you respond to Jeff's other questions?

Everyone,

I apologize for missing the meeting this afternoon, we had a few fire drills on the desk this afternoon.  Maybe I could get a overview from the meeting tomorrow morning.

A few of my questions are:

Are we going to show this hit in Q3?  
How do we drill down on each bucket?  
Do we have the actual meter data for each customer and their site?
How do we prevent such variances occurring in the future?

Have a great night, 
Jeff Richter

All,

Attached is a consolidated report of the service customers which sold energy to EPMI at a PX index price during the month of January,

There are a few items which need to be completed prior to us being able to pay the customers.

There are more customers on this report then need to be processed.

At this point please only process the information for the following customers:

Delano  
Tosco	  
Arco  
Wheelabrator 

All Additional customers will be taken care of after I return to the Portland office on Monday.

Action Items:

1) Stan Cocke needs to get one Annuity per customer put into EnPower.  (Disregard each deal number and put an annuity in for the total customer Annuity amount at the bottom of their activity in the Pivot table.)

2) Stan Cocke needs to notify Audrey cook at the point when Annuity entries have been completed and provide everyone in this email distribution with the deal numbers which contain the annuity amounts for each of the above customers.

3) Based on my conversation with Audrey there should be no existing Annuities in EnPower for this PX index activity which need to be removed.

4) Audrey should schedule settlements with customer to occur on Tuesday 4/3/01.

5) Audrey should provide email back to everyone included in this distribution indicating the total amount being paid to each of the four customers for their PX index activity.

6) Mid Marketing will send out an email to their customer contacts to inform them of the settlement amounts and timing.

We need to take care of this today so we can get these customer paid by Tuesday.

If anyone has questions regarding the content of the worksheet or the action items which need to occur, please give me a call on my cell.  I will not be available after 5pm Central time.  So please make your call early.

 

Thanks - MO

Patti,

Please schedule some time with Suzanne and who ever else she wishes to include from her business team.  I would also like to have Mark and Chris participate in the meeting.  I have copied Brenda on here so she can let you know if she wishes to participate.  Please schedule 30min for Chris, Mark and I to meet at a point prior to the meeting with Suzanne.  I want to make sure we have a list of questions formulated when we meet with them so don't make it right before.

Mark & Chris,

I think I have forwarded you a copy of the Distributed Generation proposal Suzanne has already sent out.  Please take a look at it and let's come up with a consolidated list of questions prior to this meeting.  

I'm not quite sure the function of the ROC.  It appears that wholesale has created some redundant function to those we use CSC for today.  (This could be a good thing).

Hi Murray.  I am working closely with Victor Gonzalez and Tom Blanks, and they are both familiar with the DG product.  A majority of the questions you asked below concern functions that will be handled by Fred Kelley or Lloyd Will in the Retail Operations Center (ROC).  I put my response to your questions in red below.  Please let me know what day and time is convenient for you to meet and I'll reserve time.

Thanks Murray,
Suzanne

Suzanne,

I have taken a look at your proposals and it looks like a very attractive product.  There are a few items I'm going to need to research to determine our ability to quickly turn a settlement solution around.  I do not know of any internal automated processes to support the type of billing you are proposing in your deal.  Which mean that everything would be manual.  

This type of settlement is something which is similar to settlement calculations we have performed in our wholesale business in the west.  However.  To feel comfortable that we can settle these deals in the quick turn around time which you have identified (10 days following the end of the month).

I do have a few questions which I would like to discuss with you next week (9/24 - 9/26).

Will we install meters at each facility to ensure we have real-time access to generation / curtailment data? The ROC will install interval meters on each of the DG assets.  We may or may not be able to access the data in reat time.  For LC, we will use a baseline calculation.
Who are you anticipating will install the meters and perform the MDMA function? The ROC
Will each contract have the utility / control area market price identified in the contract (Actual Publication being used in settlements)? Yes.  For example, our initial target market is New York Zones J and G.  We will settle with the customer off of the NYISO hourly posted clearing price for the respective zone.
For invoicing the Generator, Where will the Operation cost be derived from and will it be stated in the contract? The Generator will receive a fixed payment for every MWh they run.  This payment is intended to cover O&M and fuel expenses and it will remain fixed over the life of the contract.

This is the start of my questions.  As I review your proposal further, I'm sure I will have some more.

Thanks - MO
