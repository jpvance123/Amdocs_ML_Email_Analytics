All,

The Analyst and Associate Programs recognize we have many Analyst needs that 
need to be addressed immediately.  While we anticipate many new Analysts 
joining Enron this summer (late May) and fulltime (August) we felt it 
necessary to address some of the immediate needs with an Off-Cycle Recruiting 
event.  We are planning this event for Thursday, February 15 and are inviting 
approximately 30 candidates to be interviewed.  I am asking that you forward 
this note to any potential interviewers (Managers or above).  We will conduct 
first round interviews in the morning and the second round interviews in the 
afternoon.  We need for interviewers to commit either to the morning 
(9am-12pm) or afternoon (2pm-5pm) complete session.  Please submit your 
response using the buttons below and update your calendar for this date.  In 
addition, we will need the groups that have current needs to commit to taking 
one or more of these Analysts should they be extended an offer.   Thanks in 
advance for your cooperation.

  


Thank you,
Jana

Thinking about bull move, the only trade I really like is being long physical 
and short NYMEX.  If you believe that NYMEX is doing a "buzz lightyear" 
(infinity and beyond), the next question is where does that put the cash.  
Back in '95, Chicago cash went to $40 and merc died out sub 5 dollars.  Also, 
'95 had a huge geographic basis rift, the structural shift had Z3 trading 
about $1.50 over Waha.  On the upside, cash will suffer constraints, causing 
demand spikes. On the downside, cash shouldn't materially outpace NYMEX.

Reviewing geographic arbs and considering the east coast political 
environment (high potential for congressional intervention) as well as ok-ish 
storage, the East may be the best basis sell vs. a long west trade (Waha I'm 
uncertain about, particularly if the cold doesn't hit Texas...Chicago might 
be better given what's going on there except for the Alliance issue...Socal 
appears to be the best geographic long...PGE citygate could really rock given 
storage and increase supply competition given Alliance PL...    The 
Z6/Chicago spread is trading around $1.56 for the winter  (FH) and  approx. a 
dime in today's intra-month.   The Z6 vs. NGI-PGE/CG spread has the Jan-Mar 
around .94 cents, Z6 over. Intra-month it is trading at $2.43, PGE/CG over 
Z6   (I'm waiting on additional stats, but I think I like this trade...)

Additionally, playing the '95 scenario, we should be long every basis 
downstream of Henry and short something else, maybe NYMEX, Waha, Katy  
(notice smaller font)   I'm still reviewing economic stats regarding the 
drivers to these trades such as, Sable Island, LNG, Chippewa (Canadian 
imports) and Chicago/California storage . As well as evaluating which 
geography would be the best buy....

Preliminary trades  (let me know which ones strike your interest and I'll 
focus my analysis..)

Long NGI-PGE/CG, Short Z6
Long CNG North Valley,  Short Z6
Long NGPL Lousiana pool, short MOPS, TETCO STX
Long CGT, short NYMEX  (not very exciting, small basis)
Long Z6, short Chippewa
Long physical, short NYMEX  

Still looking, still thinking,  but gun-to-my-head....

Frank

No not a promise but it more or less went like this:  Kathy:  "Lavo, you have 
caused me a lot of grief by taking both Ryan and Chad, you wouldn't believe 
the overtime I had to work.  I should get some kind of hiring bonus or 
something".  John:  "Well if you go three for three you're on".

I have read that the average cost of hiring/training someone is approx 
$80,000.  I am willing to accept much less than this.  Actually I don't 
really expect anything I just thought I would give it a shot.

As natural gas prices rose in December, traders at the New York Mercantile 
Exchange kept one eye on the weather forecast and another on a weekly gas 
storage number.

Lavo tells me this guy needs to leave but apparently there is some debate 
about him staying?

Can you tell me:

Where he is  HE WORKS IN M&A.  CURRENTLY HE IS HELPING WITH THE SALE OF THE 
GAS BUS. UNIT.  CLOSELY WORKS  WITH BAXTER BUT ACTUALLY REPORTS TO KISHKILL.  
WE TOLD HIM BACK IN DECEMBER THAT HE NEEDED TO REPATRIATE AT THE END OF THE 
MONTH (JAN).  HE WENT ON VACATION AND NOW HE IS OUT SICK.  HE TOLD US THAT HE 
IS COMING BACK TO THE OFFICE NEXT WEEK.  I'LL BE TALKING TO HIM ON THE 
REPATRIATION AND JOE ON HIS PERFORMANCE (WE RATED HIM ISSUES BUT AT THE 
GLOBAL VP PRC IT WAS CHANGED TO NEEDS IMPROVEMENT).  IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING 
THAT HE IS GETTING A JOB WORKING AT EBS.  THAT IS THE LAST COMMUNICATION WE 
HAVE (INITIALLY BAXTER WANTED HIM).   BASED ON THE INTEREST FROM BAXTER AND 
OTHERS WE PLACED HIM ON THE TRANSITION LIST BUT WE WANT HIM OUT AS OF THE END 
OF THE MONTH.  LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED ADDITIONAL INFO.  MP
Who he works for
What issue is
etc.,

a) Variable Cost of Fuel = $4

   c) Transmission = $15.60 (i.e. based on a $100 average pool price)
   d) Freight on Energy above target = $2.40
   e) Availability Incentive Payment = $26
    f) Amortization of Initial $300 MM bid - using 6% = $4
                using 15% = $7.8
    
Total of a) to f) = $68-$72.  Total of what is considered variable cost

These costs are based on dispatching the full target availability of 612 MW.  
If the plant is dipatched down to 386 MW, then the 386 MW
have to be priced at 49*612/387 = $76

Can you please review the attached and let me know if you approve?  Also,

Thanks!

John,

I have attached some updated appendices from last May's Ontario Electricity 
Supply & Demand report created by Eric LeDain.  Unfortunately, the IMO has 
not updated the Monthly Generation by Type, Monthly Imports & Exports by 
Intertie and the Nuclear Performance Reports.

In early November, we had requested all IMO Transition Information be 
updated.  To date, the IMO has only updated hourly demand information.  As we 
continue to pressure the IMO, more information will be available.

Updates were made on the following appendices:

1. Ontario Net Exports/Imports - January 1997 through August of 2000

2. Scatter Diagram of Load and Cooling Degree Days

3. Ontario Average Peak Demand at each Temperature 1998, 1999, and 2000 
(through the month of October)

4. Peak Supply and Demand 2001,2002, & 2003



I would like to submit a complete report when the IMO Transition Information 
is updated.

Toronto is great.  We have a quality team here. I'm am anxious for the market 
to open.

Garrett

John,

This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
me:


Dear Vincent,

I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.

I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
with Albert Friedberg.

 I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.

I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
research in the field of energy markets.

With my very best regards and personal wishes,

John: 

On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be 
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate 
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was 
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the 
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing 
deals. 

This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We 
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship 
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th, 
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM 
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet, 
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your 
attendance.

See you there.

Marty Sunde

There will be a Trader's Roundtable meeting every Tuesday at 4:00PM in 
EB3321.  

First Message that was sent out:
As mentioned during the fourth quarter, Gary and I would like to begin 
regular meetings of our Trader's Roundtable.  The ideas generated from this 
group should be longer term trading opportunities for Enron covering the 
markets we manage.  In addition, this forum will provide for cross commodity 
education, insight into many areas of Enron's businesses, and promote 
aggressive ideas.  

Each week, we'll summarize commodity trading activity, and provide an open 
forum for discussion.  Your input is valuable, and we've limited this group 
to our most experienced traders, and would appreciate regular participation.  
Our first meeting will be Tuesday, January 16 at 4:00pm in EB3321.

John, below are several issues I wanted to bring to your attention prior to 
finalizing merit increases for East Power.  I have also given David Oxley the 
same information in order for you to discuss this morning when you meet.  
Call me if you have any questions.

 M. Dana Davis's employment agreement will expire in February 28, 2001.  I 
imagine we will want to renew with the new salary on the employment 
agreement.  K Presto would like to recommendation that we give him a $20,000 
increase.


Rogers Herndon' s employment agreement  will expire September 14, 2001.  Do 
we want to renew earlier and roll the base salary changes (if any) into the 
employment agreement. Kevin Presto would like to give him a $15,000 increase.


Who will be responsible for John Zufferli's increase (if any ) since he 
transferred to Canada and now has been promoted to VP.



Rob Benson was given a significant increase in the global comp system at the 
insistence of K.Presto.  Kevin states that John Lavorato indicated to him 
that Benson needed to be taken care of.  With that being said Kevin would 
like to bring him up more in line with a commerical director, which he was 
just promoted to.  His employment agreement will expire 2/1/01.  So would it 
also make sense to delete him from the merit database and renew an employment 
agreement rolling in his new salary?



Finally, I need you to decide on Chris Dorland's new salary.  He is currently 
making $81,000 and I have recommended $90,000.  He is an Associate that is 
being made a commerical manager.  He was ranked superior and Presto has 
indicated that he is expecting around $100,000.  Presto finally settled on 
$95,000 provided you concur.  Our plan prior was slightly stagger salaries 
for individuals as associates promoted to commercial manager based on final 
rankings.  ($85,000 strong, $87,500 for excellent, $90,000 for superior). The 
guideline from the program is $86,000 but is left up to the business unit 
discretion.

John,
I've had a couple of questions regarding ROCE, and trader's goals.  If it is 
okay with you, I would like to see the goals and objectives you laid out to 
be of better service to desk heads.  Right now I'm goal searching so that I 
can be better.  This type of information may help me in formulating a game 
plan.  I understand that all you've ever asked for is that the traders 
understand VAR, and that VAR be more accurate, but I'm trying to take this 
risk management game to the next level.

Let me know if this works for you if not maybe we could discuss this later 
...maybe over beers..

Frank

John,
Just thinking out loud, I think the market has a better chance of seeing $5, 
maybe $3 dollars, before it see's $9.  I would recommend initiating a short 
position.

My stop loss, would depend on trade size, however, without doubt,  I would be 
flat if we got over unchanged.

John,

Happy New Year!!  I wish you and your family the best and as Dina puts
it...BUY LOW, SELL HIGH (lol).

I have a great deal of songs to send you.  Just look at the lists (you can
open it with Wordpad) and let me know wich ones you like or if you prefer I
will send them all to you.  Also, I wont be able to send them via e-mail
(too big in memory size).  Therefore, check to see if your IT group have an
IOmega Zip Drive (100 MB) so that I can mail the songs to you.

I have attached the copy of the mi2 theme song and a catalog of the
Corvette.

As mentioned in our report last week, AB1X is expected to pass the Senate 
later this week.  Lawmakers were busy over the weekend and yesterday marking 
up the bill.  One change includes the Department of Water Resources will use 
a "weighted average" price of 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour instead of the 5.5 
cents per kilowatt hour price cap.   

Another bill is currently being drafted by Assemblyman Keeley and Sen. Battin 
allowing QFs to sell electricity at 8 cents per kilowatt hour (down from 18 
cents) to Socal.  The bill stemmed from a series of negotiations that have 
been taking place with CA government officials.  However, a source close to 
the negotiations confirms that  PG&E was not involved in the meetings. 

Per Friday's update, negotiations continue on a bond issuance plan but sides 
remain divided on amount and if it would include the internal debt of the 
parent companies or just debt due to external creditors.

On Ed Graham.

I pushed the issue with Cliff and Kevin Hannon.

Kevin, Cliff and Jeff Donanue (current head of M&A for Broadband) met on the 
issue after I talked to them.  They have decided to give him 6 months to 
perform or he will be let go.  His bonus for 2000 will be 0. 

I know you wanted a different outcome but this is the best I could do.

Bush Nominates Hebert for Energy 
( January 22, 2001 ) 


WASHINGTON, Jan 22, 2001 (AP Online via COMTEX) -- President Bush named Curt 
Hebert, who has argued against federal involvement in the California 
electricity crisis, as chairman of the agency that regulates wholesale power 
markets. 

      White House spokesman Ari Fleischer announced the selection as senior 
administration officials, including Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, met at 
the White House to discuss the California power situation. 

      Hebert, the former state utility regulator in Mississippi, is the only 
Republican on the current five-member Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
which he will head. Bush shortly is expected to name two new members. 

      Despite California's problems, Hebert gave a strong endorsement Monday 
of electricity deregulation and letting market forces determine prices and 
electricity supplies. 

      As FERC chairman, he said in a statement, "I will do my utmost to see 
that competition is encouraged, that it is fair, that consumers have a 
genuine choice, and that the public interest is safeguarded." 

      Total competition in the electricity industry "is part of the solution 
rather than part of the problem" now faced in California, he said. Retail 
prices there in many cases remain regulated. 

      A close friend of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., Hebert 
has argued forcefully in recent weeks against FERC imposing price controls on 
wholesale electricity sales into California. 

      When FERC in mid-December took modest steps to help California cope 
with its surging electricity prices, Hebert agreed with the measures, but 
said he would rather have favored eliminating all price controls. 

      In an interview last week, Bush also expressed his opposition to 
imposing price controls - in the form of FERC-mandated price caps on 
wholesale power - on the California market, saying they would be 
counterproductive. 

      California Gov. Gray Davis and the state's cash-strapped utilities have 
urged FERC to intervene in the wholesale market, arguing that power 
generating companies were price gouging. FERC has so far rejected the plea. 

      Hebert was described by power industry officials as a free-market 
advocate when it comes to the electricity industry and has favored leaving 
decisions on electricity deregulation to states instead of the federal 
government. 

      Hebert replaces William Massey, a Democrat, who was elevated to the 
chairmanship by President Clinton on Jan. 19, after James Hoecker, another 
Clinton appointee, unexpectedly resigned. 

      Hebert, 38, a former Mississippi state legislator and member of the 
state Public Service Commission, joined FERC in November, 1997. His current 
term expires in 2004. 

      He comes from Pascagoula, Miss., as does Lott. 

      With Hoecker's resignation there remain two vacancies on the 
commission, which has been at the center of both the natural gas and 
electricity industry's shift to deregulation in recent years. 

      It was FERC that issued rules that opened the nation's electric power 
grid to competition in the mid-1990s, prompting many states - led by efforts 
in California - to embrace electricity industry deregulation amid promises it 
would lead to lower consumer prices because of competition. In most cases, 
deregulation has not led to substantial savings for consumers. 

      In California, where the effort has been acknowledged as a failure, 
power prices have soared amid shortages that have produced rolling blackouts 
in recent days and threatened two of the state's major investor-owned 
utilities with bankruptcy.

Everyone,

I know everyone has been awaiting this email.  I just moved my family to 
Tokyo on Monday and let's put it this way, the last 36 hours have been a bit 
hectic.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

The ERCOT team has met with Joe Des Champs for the Mid Marketing position in 
our region.  It is my understanding that you must interview Joe before we can 
make him a job offer.  I would like to proceed with the interview process.  
Joe worked for me at Williams as the lead trader in the West.  Here are my 
thoughts on Joe and why he is a good fit for our group.

1.  He has a very good understanding of the trading business, especially 
natural gas in Texas and the western US.
2.  His personality is a great fit for Texas (especially with the loss of Jim 
Ducote).  Joe has a lot of successful relationships within Texas and relates 
well to Texans.  His initial appearance and manners appear to be easy going 
and laid back, however he is a very agressive and effective trader.  His 
command of the physical gas business is outstanding.
3.  Learns fast and relates well to traders.  I believe Doug and Joe will 
work well together.
4.  Likes to work the phones.

What he is not:
1.  He is new to the power business.  However, he served the Williams/AES 
plants in California.  So he is familiar with the power.

I would be glad to discuss Joe in detail or set up the phone interview.  I 
have attached Joe's resume.  Thanks.

On a quarterly basis, the Executive Compensation group provides a report to 
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Executive 
Committee member stock holidings.    Such holdings include:

shares held in a family trust, 
your personal brokerage account, 
in certificate form, or 
in an IRA.  
any shares held in connection with Company plans (i.e., ESOP, savings plans, 
phantom shares, option grants, or restricted stock grants), although shares 
acquired that are held free-and-clear should be included.

Because of your inclusion in the Executive Committee, we will be requesting 
this data from you prior to each quarter's report.  Your response is greatly 
appreciated.

However, with the recent announcement and the revised Committees, I am in the 
process of updating this report in preparation for the December 11 meeting.  

I have access to shares held in the Company Plans (last bullet above).   
Please provide me with your current personal ENE stock holdings (as of 
11/30/00). 

Please contact me if you have any questions (713-345-8085).

I appreciate your response.

Mary
