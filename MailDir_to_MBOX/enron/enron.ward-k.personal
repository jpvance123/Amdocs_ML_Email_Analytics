Yes, I realized where your name came from right AFTER I hit "send."  Duh!
That's what I get for being up so late.  But, anyway, good to hear from you.
I try to see your mom and dad at least once a year.  Kristen is so cute and
smart!  My mom just loves to get to see them, so I try to take her up now
and then.  She's getting a little short on memory these days, so I want her
to make the best of life while she still can.
I know you're glad to be closer to home.  Your mom showed us pictures of
your house.  It was beautiful.  Are you still traveling a lot?  That's
exciting for those of us who "go" now and then, but it's got to get old
after awhile, and nerve-racking these days.
Well, let me go, gotta get some sleep. tomorrow is a long day.
Keep in touch, tell your sister hi!

Well, I'm finally settled in over here at Dynegy.  It sucks going back full
time and they don't have a gym.  I'm going to talk to my manager about
working out during lunch because there is no way I can after work.  Anyway,
I was looking at the Enron gym schedule and there are a few classes that
last 30 minutes.  That would work for me!  It's not really enough, but it
will have to do.
So far, so good.  I think the job will be interesting and I'm excited about
the experience.  Working full time is just really hard for me right now.
If I quit, or try to find another part-time position, I think I would be
shooting myself in the foot.  This is a great opportunity to get experience
if I can hack for at least a year.  I am going to approach them about a
9-80 schedule, though.  We'll see.  I'm supporting the traders, so that
might be difficult.
Let me know when you want to get together for lunch.  I have plans Thursday
and Monday so far.  By the way, did you ever have your housewarming party?
I saw that in my calendar and realized we never talked to you further about
it.  Things were pretty chaotic the last few weeks.

Hope all is well!
Jana

Ms. Ward, what no message on the voice mail? I really think it is kind of
cute that you were chicken to leave a message. Modern technology.  I guess I
will have to be the brave one and pick up the phone. I hope your weekend was
fun. What time did you and your friend from California leave Downing? Look

I was thrilled to hear from you today.

I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
visit with my grandchildren.

Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
up to my office)

When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
I can mail it to you.

Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
kids?????

Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.

Love, Kathy

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

Things are good. The market has quietened down considerable and is downright
boring now. I think we have been ruined by the crazy market. Things settled
right in for you in Houston now? I am still going to hold you to a night on
the town when/if I ever get over that way.

Keep in touch.

Cheers

that is too weird, i had just started typing an email to you when i received
this from you.  glad you enjoyed the wine although you were supposed to wait
for me to come to houston to drink it.  not much new here i have just been
spending what seems like every spare minute on the beach lately and it makes
it really difficult to come to work.  this weekend was awesome, perfect
weather, great waves, etc.  i'm taking some surfing lessons next weekend,
looking forward to that.  been trying to be more active in the market
lately, still can't deal with you guys which costs me $$$ every day.
supposedly it will be worked out soon, we can deal in gas now just not in
power.  this marathon that i'm running in portland next month is
headquartered in the hilton downtown.  is the heathman the best place to
stay in that area or should i try somewhere else.  i stayed at the heathman
last time and it was ok.  making reservations right now for coer d'alene, do
i want a west facing suite (looking out at the lake)?  when it gets closer
to time you'll have to tell me what to get at the spa.  i plan on playing
golf and getting massages and doing little else.  i probably won't see a
soul from the conference except on the golf course.  i still am waiting to
hear from you when a good time would be to come to houston.  when you were
on your trip did you find a good island where i could go and no one could
ever find me and i could sit on the beach for the rest of my life drinking
pacificos?  it seems like every day that goes by i come closer to doing
it........anyways, hope all is well there, let me know what's going on with
you and what fabulous vacation you're going on next....

INTEROFFICE MEMO

From: John Lavorato & Dave Delainey

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the
US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the
appropriate industries and customers with our respective value
propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages
Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the
right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the
maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or
industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in
their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those
industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ
significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the
boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please
over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before
customer contact.

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption
or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in
ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be
managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical
that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal,
Hamilton-Sundstrom
Large Agricultural Processing

    Two elderly gentlemen, who had been without sex 
    for several years, decided they needed to visit a 
    cat-house for some tail..... When they arrived, the 
    madam took one look at them and decided she wasn't 
    going to waste any of her girls on these two 
    old men. 
 
    So she used "blow-up" dolls instead. She put the 
    dolls in each man's room and left them to their 
    business. After the two men were finished, they 
    started walking home and began to talking. The 
    first man said, "I think the girl I had was dead. 
    She never moved, talked or even groaned... how 
    was it for you?" 
 
    The second man replied, "I think mine was a witch. 
    When I nibbled on her breast..... she farted and 
    flew out the window!"

Kim,

The E-Connect Project is still underway and will probably be in production by the end of this month. E-Connect will be the newest way to connect to Enron's network from home or when traveling. However, attached is the instructions for an alternate way to connect to Enron. These instructions have been approved by my boss. They are self-install instructions, but since we are such good friends, I do not mind helping you out. If you need help setting up your Click@Home PC and/or VPN access to Enron, feel free to give me a call to schedule a time for a home install. I will be doing a home install for Mike Grigsby tomorrow around 6PM. He is in the Westheimer and Kirby area, so depending on where your live and if time permits I can help you as well. You can also give me a call and I can help you out over the phone.

  
You will need to have the BlackIce Software available for the second set of instructions. This CD was sent to all Click@Home customers in a blue folder/packet with a mousepad. I can give you a CD with just about everything you'll need, tomorrow.

Thanks,

Kim,

I met with the lovely Bruno Jeider last week.  If I were to characterize him, I would have to say that he reminds me of Schultz from "Hogan's Heroes".  He sees nothing.  He knows nothing.

I asked him about SCE's impending bankruptcy.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about his gas/power positions.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him about Burbank's power plant development.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

I asked him if he knew how to please a woman.  His reply is that he hasn't kept up on it and doesn't know what's going on.

In short, if you plan to meet with Burbank, make sure your meeting includes their traders.

Laird

Congrats Kim. Having heard the rumor on the street about the success you
folks have enjoyed this quarter, I'd say you couldn't have timed the move
any better. The next time I am in Houston (which will be the first time)I am
expecting to have you show me the town. I'll give you enough notice so you
can book the next day off sick.

Sound O.K.?

It was good to hear from you.

Talk to you sometime soon.

Cheers

Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name -
I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market
gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but
decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had
completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move
for me.

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and
New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get
anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon

For all of you who are active participants in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan, we have made arrangements with Northern Trust, our Plan Administrator, to expedite any loan requests made during the week of June 18 - June 29 in order to help you during this recovery period from any flood damage you may have experienced.

If you do not already have an outstanding loan, you can request up to 50% of your balance up to a maximum of $50,000.  To request a loan follow these three easy steps in order to ensure quick processing:

	1. Log onto the website:   https://www4.rsweb.com/61045/# or call the Benefits Service Center at 713.853.7979.

	2. Enter your SSN and your Personal Identification Number and click on "Loan Information" to see the amount available.
	If you wish to request a loan, click on "Loan Modeling/Request" and follow the instructions.

	3. Checks will be mailed from Northern Trust in Chicago  on June 27 for loans requested the week of June 18 - June 22 	and on July 5 for loans requested	June 25 - June 29. 

NOTE:  The IRS restricts Hardship Withdrawals to specific circumstances outlined in the Money-in-Motion guide on the benefits website.  Unfortunately, while we know the flood has imposed hardships on many of you, these circumstances do not qualify for a withdrawal.

we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride
mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by
far
the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you
checking any bags?

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers

Scotty,

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings
and crashed the power party!  How are things?  Houston is good and gas is
great right now.  Let me know how you are -

Wow!  sorry to hear about all that.  i didn't even know you were dating
someone, i am way out of the loop.  whoever he was is obviously a fucking
idiot.  i've told you before my opinions of you and i'll tell you again
anytime.  you do have a lot going on but look at it this way, it can only
get better from here.  i might still try and come to houston, just not sure.
will let you know.  hope everything gets better for you....

Funny you should ask about my life right now.  Now you are sure to get an
earful!  Beware - My country is at war and going into a major recession, my
company is falling down around my feet, my grandmother is sick,  I am
broke, and my boyfriend broke up with me last week, further confirming my
ability to fail when it comes to relationships.  ( I know I act tought when
it comes to this stuff but I am really sad about this one)  I guess that I
am not sick and I do have lots of friends.  But I am tired and need someone
to take over at this point - - - -

I can't believe that you didn't get my email about gas being a buy a couple
of weeks ago.  I guess if I had seen you when I was there, I could have
told you in person.  AS for business over here, gas and power trading is
still going strong.  However, all of the events have affected us in a huge
way financially.  Down to whether we get bonuses or not.  It is not going
to be a good year just trying to stay strong but I think that we will
survive, and mostly thanks to EnronOnline.

Curious about what's going on there since you mentioned it.  Anyway - sorry
to burden you with my personal problems.  I do hope things are going ok for
you - too bad you're not going to make it here.  As we are in a cash
crunch, I think I am probobly grounded for the remainder of the year.  Who
knows!

Keep in touch -
K.

k,


thanks, i could use all of the luck that i can get right now trading this
market.  i have heard so many rumors about what's going on over there that
my head is spinning.  i won't bombard you with questions though.  how's
everything going other than work?  any opinions on this gas market?  you
are
supposed to be my gas guru, i thought i would have heard from you a week
ago
telling me to buy it, that it was going to make this huge move.  maybe the
email got lost.  went to florida this weekend for the ga/fla game and once
again left disappointed.  anyway, hope all is well, let me know if you're
going to be out this way anytime soon, my nov trip might be cancelled now,
i'll tell you more about all the crap going on over here next time i see
you....

Let me know all about what materializes with your man hunt?????
Everyone needs a mate, I think.  It is nice to share with another person
who is kind and loving towards you and will be there through thick and
thin.
I know I wish I could see all of you in Houston, but that isn't in the
cards.  I just bet Robin and Katie will have a great time with the new
little girls.  I just love Molly and Liam and I now think I am a
grandmother by adoption.  Molly is growing so much.
I am still cleaning houses while Mel is back at work.  It is tough for
him as he still doesn't feel good.  I just handle one day at a time right
now.  Things have been better for us and I pray they will be that way
again.  One never knows what the good Lord has in store for us.
In June we are going to Sand Point, Idaho for a week with our daughter,
her husband and 8 year old grandson.  A working dude ranch.  Can you
believe that??  They have a lake with fish and nice golf course for Mel,
horses for those who want to ride all day, even a cattle drive, but for
me I just want to rest, read and not clean houses.
I am getting anxious for summer now.  Nice weather always brings out the
best in people.
Now that I have been so long wined and yakked your ear off I will go
clean my own house.
Love, Kathy
ps-  If you ever get back here on business or whatever and need a place
to lite my home is open to you.  I have 2 extra bedrooms that are ready
for visitors.  Guess I could open a Bed and Breaks fast!!!

Further to our last group meeting.  I have discussed and reviewed the confirmation, deal ticket and data entry process with the appropriate parties and believe that the charts attached provide for a clear understanding of the process we all need to follow.

The transactions start with the originator  and most of the obligation is on you guys to follow up with the paper.  In order that we start to control the output on a more formal basis, we will start by asking to see all paper for deals greater than 31 days....All I am asking is that the confirms desk generate the paper as required, get a copy to the originator and the originator has a OBLIGATION to sign off or make appropriate changes as soon as possible.

The Denver office follows a slightly different procedure as you guys have Theresa to enter deals into Sitara and I know that this effort is coordinated with Carol.  Don't change a thing, just ensure you are comfortable with the paper flow and that if there are any holes that they are filled with a revised procedure. 

Let's see how this process works and re-visit at the end of the year.

If there are any questions regarding this note, pls do not hesitate to contact me.  If you think this note needs to be distributed to other people pls forward as required. 

BT

Tina, will you copy our group please.

This weekend, my friends and car nuts you can watch on TV my maiden voyage to the SCCA national championship race in which I ran in September at Mid Ohio.  It is on Speedvision which is (in Houston) channel 114 if you have TW digital cable, and # 607 if you have satellite svc.

Time is 9pm Sunday.  Don't expect to see me in the front, but you may enjoy some close racing and see me somewhere on the screen.  My car looks like a Jamaican flag and I have a yellow helmet, car # 75.  Next year I will be looking to be at the front.  Thanks for everyone's support and interest during this successful season.

Regards,

PJH

we had a great time.  ed knows a lot about wine and took us to a lot of
boutique wineries where we were in the proprietor's houses hanging out,
drinking wine with them.  it was awesome.  my favorites were pride
mountain,
paloma, and guilliams.  they are all very small but make incredible wines.
the place we stayed was nice, nothing great.  we ate at La Trevigne, napa
valley grille, and bouchon.  they were all very good, la trevigne was by

the best though.  had a lot of fun.  i'll pick you up thursday, are you

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

=20

=20

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=
 available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=
curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=
us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =
Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov. Cop=
ies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will b=
e incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may als=
o be obtained for free by directing a request to either: Investor Relations=
, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) =
507-6466, Fax: (713) 767-6652; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., Enron Bu=
ilding, 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone: (713) 853-3956, Fax: (=
713) 646-3302.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be consi=
dered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders i=
n connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their d=
irect or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are availab=
le in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Kim,

I just got your e-mails. Sorry about missing your party, how was it? Hopefully you didn't have too much fun without me!

Next time, call me at 972-459-2705 to let me know you are having a party.

How is everything in Houston these days? Are you liking being back in Tejas?

Hope you are doing well and hope to see you soon.

Dave

Life has been very busy back here on the poly. We have
just come out of wetdock and the ship is a mess but
will be awesome by the time you get here. Our first
cruise this week is a gay cruise, very strange!!!!!
Its not really my type of cruise. Seeing 2 guys
cuddling each other sleeping on the deck is a bit much
for me. I dont dislike it, its just I dont understand
it. Women are such beautiful creatures, why !!!
Anyway yes I will more than likely be here when you
get here, unless I get sacked or quit, but more than
likely I will be here.

Take Care
See you soon
Love Lyndon

K2, how's life back in Texas?
I am not sure if I thanked you for making my first
singles cruise a little less like work and alot more
enjoyable. If not then Thank you. This past week was
terrible, so many drunk and abnoxious people. anyway
only one more to go and I am out of here. Not sure
what I will do except I know I am going home to relax,
back in Aus. Do some surfing and refocus on what it is
I want in life.
Hope all is well for you, your a sweet and beautiful
woman that deserves all the good things that come to
you.

Take Care

Love Lyndon

I didn't get a fax - but if you didn't put my whole name on it - it won't
get to me.  That fax is used by many!!  What is the name of the place you
charter through?  I just want to let my friend know that things are in the
works!!  Sailing sounds good - we can get Camille to come too.

Thanks for your help!

Kim

all

the lessons - ASA certified - can get you info or you can pick it up

Hey Doug,

How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch
base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds
really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to
doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway,
can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you
are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any
recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when
I get back.

Have a great weekend,

Kim Ward

Ahoy again,
Because of all the positive response, I called the  Windjammer Barefoot 
Cruise ?group department and negotiated a 20% savings  for two different 
cruises. 
?
LEGACY: October  28-November 3?cruise
**?Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Venezuela,  Aruba
??? Ensign Cabins  (bunks)??? Reg. $1000, our cruise, $800
??? Commodore (Double Bed)? Reg.  $1125, our cruise, $900??
????Port  charges,?????????????????  $90.00 
??? NO CHARGE FOR THE  STOWAWAY
??? Fare Share  will apply. It is $890 from PDX, will be less for those of 
you to the  East. Once you have made a deposit I can get the Fare Share rate 
from your  airport. ?
?
WJ is in the process of negotiating with hotels in Aruba. I  will not be 
doing group hotel arrangements; I will share info about  hotels, and those 
who want to stay over can do their own.
?
POLYNESIA: November 5-10  Repositioning Cruise (For those wanting to do a 
Back to Back)
**From St. Lucia to St. Maarten
Theme Cruise: Sea of Wellness,  
??? ??? with Massage  Therapists, Yoga, etc. 
?? ?Deck  Cabins,??????? Reg. $1100, our cruise,  $880
??? Standard Cabins,? Reg. $900,  our cruise:? $720
???  BQ,?????????????????????  Reg. $700, our cruise?? $560
??? Port  Charges?????? ?$65
?
THE CATCH: WJ group department will only  deal with one person, so all 
payments and questions have to?pass through  me. If we don't get 15 people, 
the rate reverts to the regular  rate. So, enlist your funnest?buddies to 
come along, too.  
?
HOW TO GET IN ON THE DEAL:
1). Decide which week(s) you want to sail
2). Send a $200 deposit for each cruise and $100 additional  if you plan to 
use Fare Share
??? Checks can be made out to WJ or to me,  and sent?to ??? me at: PO BOX 
1723, Newport, Oregon  97365
??? You can use your credit card.? Send  me the # and ??? expiration date, or 
you can give it to me on the  ??? ??? phone. My number is:  (541)765-4577. 
3). IF you want to use Fare Share, let me know which days  you want to arrive

Only one beer, what a wussy.  I thought you liked Beck's?  I hope this is
something that you wanted if so excellent.  I was looking forward to working
on some long term stuff with you.  Keep me posted on the job.

Go W.!!!

Hey, I know that Paul Choi called you this morning about Mona - I just
wanted to let you know that there is a probobility that I will be going
back to Houston to market gas in the west.  I am very sad to leave Portland
- if it happens.  I will keep you posted but since things haven't quite
been announced, please keep me off of your gossip vine until further
notice!!

If this takes place, we must have one more beer!!

Kim

Just wanted to say Hi, I know  you are at work but had to share something.
About two weeks ago, we had to go to dinner at the Peabody with some business
people in town and Jeff introduced me to someone named Cam Smith.  Jeff had
told me he was from Cleveland, MS and his dad was Dr. Smith, OK I put it
together it was Bruce Orman's nephew,  Ok I feel really old NOW!!   He is
young starting out with this particular company that sells to Jeff.  Anyway,
he remembered you and said he always liked you so much.  He gave me scoop on
Bruce and Nancy about moving to Oxford, etc.  He was really nice and quite
country talking but he is married and lives somewhere north of Memphis in Tn.
    What a small world.   Just think you could be living in Oxford town with
that Postmaster!! H A! Just kidding, I would love to see you soon.  Maybe I
can visit you one day.   CT

You're a star, Kim. Keep your chin up. Let's try to get the gang together in December. I think we all need a serious blowout weekend.

OK, just talked to LP

We are going to meet up later with his Aunt & Uncle (very fun people) and he and Cher around 9pm.  I have to go to a happy hour for Tosha's departure at 5:30 at Tealas.  You are welcome to come if you like.  

Also, we have been invited to go down to the bay near Galveston and ride Jetskis tomorrow afternoon with LP and Cher.  A guy from Halliburton has a big spread down there and it sounds like fun.  We are planning to go around lunch time.  That is good bc I need to get some stuff done tomorrow around the house.  Are you in??  I hope so.
