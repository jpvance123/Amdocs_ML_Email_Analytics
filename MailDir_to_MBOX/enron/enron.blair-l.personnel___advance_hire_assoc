Shelley, 

Per my conversation with Mary Kay, attached is a resume for Chris Miller.  I know Chris well and believe he has the strong communication skills, intellect and drive that it takes to contribute to the ETS team.  For these reasons, I would like to recommend Chris for a position within your group. 

Please give me a call if you have any questions or would like to discuss.  Thank you for your consideration.  See you soon!
 
Mike Barry

Lynn,
 I did an orientation on Nominations, Scheduling and Allocations with all three new hires.
Terry is working on the Compressor station field trip.
The teams are training as if the new hires were going to stay on their team.
South Central team has a training agenda for Cara they are going to share with TW and the North team.
Florida is waiting on May Lou to come back to have time to get Jacob to Gas Control.

Lynn, to summarize and remind us of the to do's from the luncheon.

Scott liked having a daily training agenda.
Terry and I should do the Nomination and Scheduling presentation to new hires that was done for IT.
Jacob needs to be scheduled to spend time in Gas Control
Lynn is going to contact Dan Pribble about taking new hires to a compressor station.
Teams need to be comfortable in training new hires in all aspects wheatear they know how long new hires will be on their team.

Other than that Scott and Jacob seemed satisfied with their training and progress in Customer Service.

John Buchanan

Lynn,  I had talked to shelley right before I went on vacation about some openings you had in the scheduling area.  I don't know if she mentioned this, but christopher (my son) and a friend of his from Mount Michael are interested in applying for them.  I forwarded Pat Barry's to Shelley and Mike Barry in marketing sent Christopher's to her.  Thought I'd let you know since it appeared that shelley was on vaction and I wasn't sure when she would return.  Let me know if Mike needs to send Christopher's directly to you also.   thanks for any consideration     
How is everything else going? Oneok decision was good, except for the meter error issue.   MK
