Elizabeth --

Thanks for continuing to keep us informed.  While I can appreciate this is
out of your control, you are one of our voices left there in Houston.  It
seems to me that there is, frankly, no excuse for the continuing delay on
expenses.  It is baffling that the company has not even asked the court for
permission to pay them.  We read of people getting millions to work 90 days=
,
yet the rest of us with much smaller bank accounts can't repaid for expense=
s
we incurred and had approved while employees.  American Express just
announced their own layoffs of thousands so I doubt they will be very
forgiving.

Anything you or others can do in Houston, particularly at this time of year=
,
would be appreciated.

Finally, who on the official creditors committee is there to represent
employees and ex-employees -- anybody?

Attached are the remaining LJM questions from the all-employee meeting today.  I have not included questions that were answered in full during the meeting.  I have also tried to eliminate the majority of duplicates.  You'll note a lot of references to ethics and values, as we anticipated.  Mark Frevert asked if we were going to post these questions and their responses on the intranet or elsewhere (we could do it in eMeet).  Please let us know if we need to begin preparations for this.

Steve, I've attached our proposed plan.  Your comments are welcome.  We're 
looking at costs so we can estimate a budget for this.

Due to current business circumstances, on November 28, 2001, Enron's Board of Directors adopted an amendment to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose "Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose "request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts."
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com.

Subject:	Message 5 - expense reports

I'm not going to attach the old messages because the file is getting so big.
Ginger, Laura, Sybille, Sharon and Leslie - Please forward this message to your existing groups.

I know that lots of you are frustrated by the expense process, and I've spent the afternoon tracking things down and participated in some conversations this afternoon that answered a few of our questions.  However, it seems like things change as the whole process evolves, so bear with me - I'm sending it to you as I learn it.

- The expense run that was processed on Friday afternoon for outstanding expenses had some error in it, and the expenses weren't paid.  Apparently, the error detection systems didn't kick in, so until people started calling to say that they didn't receive their payments the problem wasn't caught.  I wasn't given a good answer for why this happened.  But - here is what's happening now:

- The current outstanding expense reports and voided expense checks up to $5,000 will be reprocessed tomorrow.  The bank takes two business days to process, so direct deposit funds will be available on Thursday and checks will be mailed as usual (presumably also Thursday).  Direct deposits will continue if you had them set up before, whether or not you have been laid off.

- If you have more than $5,000 submitted in pre-petition expenses, there is a manual process to get you a payment for $5,000.  This will also take two business days to process.  Payments to people with outstanding expenses over the $5,000 but under the $15,000 per employee cap have not yet been released, and outstanding balances of over $15,000 are also still at issue.  I'll get back to  affected individuals with more info about this issue as I learn it.  These thresholds also apply to cases where a check was issued and then voided.  Because of the cap, if you can identify any outstanding medical claims, not your co-pay, it might help to get some of this cleared up.  As I mentioned in an earlier message, we've filed with the court to ask that expenses be excluded from the cap, and the issue is on the court's calendar for January 7 (but we might not get a ruling that day).

- There are expense reports in the system that have not been fully processed - either they weren't completely entered or the approval was not granted.  The XMS team is working to identify these reports and find out who should authorize them for payment.  I'll do my best to get hold of that list and get any of ours completed and processed.

- And lastly, the instructions I got yesterday for the reimbursement of things like November cellular bills was wrong for severed employees.  Please use the attached form to claim the expense.  Once you've filled out the form, please feel free to fax it to me (713-646-8160) with any necessary backup and we'll get it into the system.  Don't worry about the coding, we'll handle that part, but it would be helpful if you know what your P number is/was.

I'm sorry this has been so frustrating for everyone!  I can't make any promises, but this is the latest information I have and I'll continue to update you as I learn things.

Take care,
Elizabeth

As discussed, here's a summary of the responses gathered in the Employee Relations focus groups we did last month.  As you can see, particularly when matched with the results of our Internal Communications survey and the Lay It On the Line survey, Lundtz's information was right on target with what employees have been telling us.

You can adjust as needed.

I've included a total return to shareholder slide at the beginning the 
presentation.  Comparing Enron to the S&P 500, it shows returns for one, five 
and 10 years (taken from the Investor Conference slides).  The one below 
covers a broader comparison, which helps to make our case, right?

Karen and Steve:  Terrie James and I thought it appropriate to communicate the severance decision separately from vacation and the other benefits and community changes in the e-mail below, which we planned to send out tomorrow.  Due to the time line HR has planned for next week, we planned to send out the severance message Monday.  Can you give us some direction on this (see David's comment)? 

On another note, what messages will the press release contain?  This came up a meeting Sarah and I had with the HR team today.

Thanks.

We need to make sure the vacation component is tied in with severance decision which we haven't yet concluded. We need PR to help with deciding how we package these things.

The attached memo is to be distributed to all US-based employees this afternoon.  We've opted to include the various changes to HR policies and employee programs in one consolidated memo to reduce the number of negative e-mails employees receive over the next few weeks.  Please review at your earliest convenience and provide changes to me.  If  I do not receive changes from you by 3:30 p.m. today, I will assume you have none.

Thanks for your prompt reply,

If the expenses are not attributable to BUs then they're attributable to our Corp. cost centers.

I just learned of another one this morning - Luiz Maurer has over $8,000.  I'm trying to get a  list from the expense system so that I can give you exact numbers and a complete list.

Thanks!

Are you saying that for those with expenses not attributable to BUs they are personal?  If so, we are not focusing on that, only business expenses.

Kalen - Per your conversation with Steve Kean, I'm aware of the following employees have expenses in excess of $5,000.

Henry Van - Total of $11,926.99 (individual reports of $10,504.19 and $1,422.80)  None is attributable to business units.

James Rountree - Total of $6,275.27 (individual reports of $6,208.18 and $67.09)  Approx. $2,000 attributable to Japan.

Chuck Goode - Total of $74,781.36 (individual reports of $10,688.50, $46,361.32 and $17,728.54)  At least part of this is attributable to business units, I'm working on getting that breakdown.

Steve Montovano - Total of $77,732.57 (individual reports of $32,328.34, $15,508.33, $25,854.30 and $4,041.60)  None attributable to business units.

I am not sure, that in any of the calls that we have had during the crisis =
surrounding Enron, that I have been able to fully express the depth of my g=
ratitude to each of you.  I am as grateful as one can be.  Like many of you=
, I loved this place and feel an immense sense of loss at what is occurring=
.  My heart also aches for the financial losses that so many have suffered,=
 not only in our group, but also throughout the company, particularly given=
 how much all of us have given to this place, some for many years.  I have =
been searching for a way to capture what we've done here and was reading a =
book the other day about Teddy Roosevelt, former President of the United St=
ates, and saw a quote that I thought was appropriate to our group and circu=
mstances?the quote is,=20

"the credit belongs to the person who is actually in the arena?who strives =
valiantly, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions and spends =
himself in worthy causes.  Who, at best, knows the triumph of high achievem=
ent and who, at worst, if he fails, fails while daring greatly so that his =
place shall never be with those cold and timid souls, who knew neither vict=
ory nor defeat."

The work that we did here was great.  The way we did it, I believe, sets an=
 example for those who will attempt to fill our shoes?and we fought for the=
 right cause, i.e., competitive markets around the world.  Our victories we=
re many and often directly due to our presence and leadership?the failure t=
hat we are experiencing as a company, however, that is so deep and so thoro=
ugh, was not of our making.  I don't know exactly what the days and weeks a=
head hold for any of us, but I am quite confident that the good work that w=
e do and the way that we do it, and the sense of community that we were abl=
e to create in this group, will show up in new places and new companies all=
 around the world over the next months and years.  I hope to speak to many,=
 if not all of you, on a one to one basis over the next several weeks to ex=
press my thanks and gratitude for having had the opportunity to work with y=
ou, but I also want to take this opportunity to wish each of you the best i=
n the future and during this holiday season.

Thank you

Steve, these are my ideas on how we should communicate our messages to 
employees:

Send an e-mail from Ken and Jeff (or maybe just Jeff) about the events in 
California and what we're doing about them.  This should be done right away.
During the next month or so while this is a hot issue, we could give updates 
in every issue of eBiz (that's every other week).
In April, we could follow up with an in-depth article in Enron Business (Vol. 
2 - April) about the issues in California and the status of all our 
deregulation efforts.  We could interview you, Rick and other key employees 
who have been actively involved.  It's been a year since we've done this.  
Hold a brown bag (hosted by you or Rick).  We could videotape the event and 
put it on IP-TV as well as offer copies of the video to employees who can't 
access IP-TV. 
ETV:  When an Enron executive testifies before the U.S. Senate or other 
government body, we could run it live, replay it after the event.  We already 
did this with your testimony a couple of weeks ago that was replayed on 
CSPAN-2.

What about India?  There is an article in eBiz (dated Feb. 16) but I'm sure 
there are lots of questions about the future of this project.  I plan to 
plant a question for Jeff at the employee meeting.  We could plant a question 
about California as well? 

You comments are welcome.

Mary

To All -

Just a heads up that the current payroll deductions we are processing include:
Taxes
Benefits (Until Cynthia notifies us otherwise)
401(k)
United Way (But Enron is no longer matching this amount & we're getting a lot of 2002 drop-outs)
Child Care
Garnishments
Accounts Receivable Balances due Enron
Parking

We've discontinued deductions related to:
Body Shop/Met Club/River Athletic Club
Energizer/Marriott
PAC
Savings Bonds
University Donations
Enron Share Purchases (Direct Service)
Auto Repair
Executive Car Care
We or the Program Sponsor have notified the participants by eMail of discontinuance.  Amounts will be refunded on 12/31 payroll, if any, for deductions taken that were not remitted to these vendors.

In addition we've discontinued payments/reimbursements and imputed income related to:
Executive Physicals
Cash Flex Perks
Club Dues
Click-at-Home  (Weil Gotshal said ok since CAH team is gone and amount is small)
Metro Mass Transit (No more free parking tickets.  Employees must pay for out of their pocket.)

Jeff --

Our Internal Communications group is continuing to look for ways to 
communicate with employees in a timely manner about hot topics that are of 
interest to them.  We're also looking to increase your exposure with 
employees.  We have a new idea, which Sherri discussed briefly with you a 
couple of weeks ago.  It's called "Jeff's Corner" and it will be a regular 
video message that will be posted on the intranet -- which can be accessed by 
99.9% of our employees.  

This is how it will work.  We will tape a 2-3 minute video of you talking 
about what's top of mind at that moment.  The tone and style will be like 
your floor meetings (one of your best employee venues), casual and 
conversational.  We suggest the first topic be "The State of Enron."  There 
is a lot of talk among employees about the cheap shots we've taken as a 
company and by you and Ken, about the decline in our stock price and about 
the widespread re-deployment efforts.   These recent events are  beginning to 
affect morale.  Employees are concerned and want to be assured that we're on 
the right side, that they will have jobs, that Enron will be here next year.  
You've helped reassure them about these things at recent floor meetings; 
however, that is only a small part of our global work force.  Having your own 
corner on the intranet will have a farther reach, and we have the capability 
to do this in-house at very low cost.  

We recommend making this a regular communication feature at least monthly, 
although since this would only involve a few minutes of your time, you could 
even tape a message to employees weekly.  The nice thing about this medium is 
we have the ability to respond immediately to current events, and having you 
speak to employees gives the message credibility.  

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the 
PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  
We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to 
discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this 
now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

Ken

You know I love this idea , BUT I still think we need to let Ken personally 
address the "shots" he has taken.  It is just not the same to have Jeff say 
it is okay that the AG of California wants to put Ken in a cell with Spike!  
I strongly believe we need to give Ken a forum too, as he has been at the 
center of alot of the recent noise.  I still believe a video with both of 
them is the right way to go...The State of Enron.  I think Jeff's Corner is a 
great idea too...can't we do both?  Ok, I have said this enough..I will go 
away quietly now and let the experts decide...Beth

Future topics could address new cost saving procedures, update on Dabhol, the 
PRC, reasons behind an organizational announcement, The Pulse survey, etc.  
We'd like this to be a forum where you can talk about topics you'd like to 
discuss.

I've checked with the technical team, and we have the capability do this 
now.  I will check your calendar with Sherri.  Let me know if you have any 
questions.

Mary
