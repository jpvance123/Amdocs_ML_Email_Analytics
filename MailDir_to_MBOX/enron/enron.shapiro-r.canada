Rob, further to your two e-mails regarding the discouraging sentiments 
expressed at the IMO Board meeting,  Garrett and I had a very productive 
meeting with Tony Dean, the Assistant Deputy Minister and Assistant Secretary 
of Cabinetand his colleague, Frank Denton, Director, Economic Policy in the 
Cabinet Office.  Dean  was identified by Bill Hawkins as a key voice on the 
electricity file.  He is someone I have been trying to see for two months.  
He was very impressed by Garrett's presentation.  His comments were as 
follows:  a) the mood in gov't is changing; b)  the  political environment 
several months ago (California, high gas prices, and complaining industrials) 
made it very difficult for the gov't to be making a decision at that time  to 
move forward with market opening; c) Enron's message  has been getting 
through" very effectively" (his words) ; and d) the political environment has 
moderated considerably: the differences from California are understood, gas 
prices have come off, and Pickering is evidently  on track.   He emphasized 
that the gov't's announcement on April  23 was "by" May 2002.

Aleck, re OPG and Pickering - too complicated of a message re Harris meeting. 
As per Lavo, he wants 5 simple/straightforward and concise messages that we 
can get accross to Harris. It needs to be short, to the point, concise, and 
simple. By cc to Paul, Lavo is looking for our first draft TODAY (you and 
Aleck need to agree on the speaking points - I provided you with my comments 
already). 

One further Item re the IMO Meeting that I didnt have time to communcicate to 
you - At one point in the meeting Guolding stated that if one industrial or 
one muni is not ready - the market will not open. I lost my mind, and told 
him that if that is the case, I need to resign as this is a complete waste of 
time and the market will never open if our CEO is telling the marketplace 
that one rinky-dink muni can hold the entire market opening hostage. Without 
doubt, it was the most frustrating/disappointing statement I've seen 
Guolding/Baillie make - I'm sure Houghton was basking in all his glory after 
that. I almost want to write a letter specific to guoulding and cc'd to 
Baillie underlining who ridiculous a position this is for the CEO of the IMO 
to be taking.

This message came back to me (too big) - I am resending and will send

__________________

Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three 
points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO 
Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving 
Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four 
Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that 
Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior 
people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in 
electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and 
the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the 
Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering 
A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling 
stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the 
government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize 
prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the 
Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting 
until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's 
financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the 
concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may 
be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim "force majeure" in respect of the 
Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition 
of "force majeure"  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if 
OPG  can claim "force majeure",  the predetermined "force majeure replacement 
cost" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to 
offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other 
words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market 
development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe, 
from OPG's perspective, now a "bad deal") that OPG made in 1999.  We should 
discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without 
compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward 
Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and 
day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this 
will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is 
a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away 
from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been 
working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material 
get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event, 
I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board 
and OEB.          `       << File: Market Opening Doc. feb 26 .doc >>  <<

Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:

 - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the 
1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news 
is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should 
have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March 
was highly probable.

 - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck 
I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.

 - Forward Market development - IMO "wants to make this happen". Assessing 
two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a 
conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward 
market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked 
re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke 
(WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market 
transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We 
need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market 
place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with 
creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie 
information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want 
to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this 
already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

		 Subject: Ken Lay/John Lavorato Briefing Material

 I have attached the following: a) a high level outline of the speaking 
points for Ken Lay and John Lavorato for their meetings with Premier Harris 
and, I hope, Wilson, Purchase and Hubert;  and  b) a more detailed briefing 
note which outlines:   i) key developments since April 4 ,   ii) our position 
re market opening and the key issues that have been raised against opening 
the market this Fall, iii) differences between California and Ontario; and 
iv) Enron's assessment of the possible difficulties in NYC this Summer.  I am 
awaiting material from Houston to complete the piece on 
NYC.                         One piece that I think needs to be added to the 
detailed briefing note is an overview of Enron's current commercial position 
in Ontario - i.e. the renegotiation of the BE contract and the likelihood of 
pursuing a retail initiative.  You will see where I have left space for that 
piece, hoping that you could draft it.                     I have endeavoured 
in the outline of the speaking points to focus on what we know the key 
issues/concerns for  the government are at this stage.                      I 
have asked Sasha Jacob to provide us with profiles of Harris, Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert to include in the final briefing package.                 
       I have prepared the material on the assumption that the best use of 
the meeting time (likely 45 minutes with Harris and 60 minutes with Wilson et 
al)  is: a)  to make  the  case for proceeding with market opening this Fall 
if the IMO and OEB reports re market readiness are positive;  b) to provide 
Harris et al with our perspective on developments in the U.S. (particularly 
New York and California) about which the government may have continuing 
concerns; and c) to ask Harris what we can do to help the gov't move forward 
to a market opening this year.                              Rick Shapiro left 
me a voice mail indicating that Lavorato and he had spoken about the visit 
and the supporting material. The agreement  between the two of them is 
evidently  that  Rob, you and I are  all to be comfortable with the briefing 
material before sending it to John, who will then review it and propose any 
changes he feels are necessary before it is forwarded to Ken 
Lay.                                 I would appreciate your questions, 
comments and suggested revisions.                                    
D.A.D.

Subject:	Market Opening Initiatives

Just to update you on some initiatives we will be undertaking over the next several months re market opening:


continued contact with the Government side of the Legislature and  key civil service personnel re pros/cons of  market opening dates under consideration (I will likely ask you both  and Garrett Tripp to attend some of these meetings depending on audience and subject).

contact with key personnel in Liberal caucus and staff to explain why it is important that market opening proceed in early 2002 ( a contact program is under way and I will likely be asking you both and Garrett Tripp to attend some of these meetings):  our sense is that Liberals will not cause the Gov't problems on this issue and the object here is to ensure that this remains the case.

broader Province wide media effort - Richard Shapiro is committed to spending the week beginning October 8 in Ontario - he and I will be spending the week visiting/talking to media outlets across the Province about why Ontario must proceed with competition in in early 2002.  I do not yet have the details of that "tour" but will provide them as soon as they are available.

contact with trade associations (not just the big ones like AMPCO etc. but the smaller less obvious ones like the independent grocers) with a view to explaining the benefits of competition  and, in the best case, possibly replicating commercial opportunities comparable to that which has developed with the CFIG. Work is already under way on this and  I would suggest that Jeff Borg work with me. 

coordination, where possible and appropriate, with other stackholders such as TH, BE, TransAlta, Direct etc. As you know, those opportunities are going to be discussed at a meeting at TH next Tuesday morning.  In my view, what is key is ensuring consistency of messaging re an early market opening, though there should  be an  opportunity  to jointly fund a public education campaign re the benefits of competition (given that the gov't appears reluctant to do this itself).

Here is the term sheet that is going to be forwarded to Lavorato re the 500 
MW.   He wants to send it to Harris et al.  I will send you a draft of the 
letter that should accompany it.  We may want to amend Lay's letter to

under separate cover.

FYI  - I think we can make a case that we are still in the running on the 
basis of the highlighted portions. 

__________________


Mr. Speaker:
This Legislature passed the Energy Competition Act in 1998 to help meet the
province's long-term electricity needs and ensure that Ontarians have a
safe, reliable and affordable supply of power.
When this government came to office in 1995, we had our work cut out for us.
Ontario's electricity sector was failing us.
Consumers and businesses had no choice of who supplied them with power. And
we went from having one of the lowest prices for electricity to the third
highest in Canada.
The monopoly we had come to rely on for safe, reliable and
competitively-priced electricity was no longer working. It had become out of
date, inefficient and too expensive. Something had to be done.
That's why I'm proud to stand up in the Legislature today to announce that:
The government is confident that conditions necessary to open the
electricity market to competition will exist by May 2002. The government is
committed to an open market while guaranteeing a safe, affordable and
reliable supply.
There are some who are fundamentally opposed to opening this market to
competition. Our government believes, however, that open, competitive
markets are beneficial. They keep costs low, encourage innovation and
benefit consumers.
There are others who share our desire to open the market, but who would like
to see it done even sooner. As government, we bear a responsibility to
ensure the opening is done right for all involved. To do this, we are
committed to opening the market at the earliest possible date, while
ensuring all of the conditions required for a smooth transition to
competition are met.
And I'm pleased to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that the four principles guiding
the government's vision have been, or will be met, by May 2002.

First and foremost, protecting consumers and offering more choice. The
overall market design and regulatory framework for introducing competition
puts customers first. Over the long term, a competitive market will lead to
the lowest possible costs and better service for all.
Second, creating a strong business climate with a reliable supply of
electricity. Ontario already has sufficient supply to meet our current
needs. Announcing a firm market opening deadline today provides greater
certainty to potential new investors who have already announced 3 billion
dollars in new generation projects.
Thirdly, we will protect our environment. My colleague, the Minister of the
Environment has announced tough new emission caps for the electricity
sector. They will be among the toughest in North America, matching the
requirements of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
Also today, Minister Witmer is announcing changes to ensure that new
electricity projects are reviewed in a clear and consistent manner under the
province's environmental assessment process.
And fourth, we will encourage new ways of doing business and support the
search for alternative sources of power. For the first time, customers will
be able to make clean air a priority by choosing the type of power they
want, including wind, fuel cells and solar. Giving them choice will help
promote the demand for cleaner, greener electricity.

And so, Mr. Speaker, I am proud to announce that Ontario's electricity
sector will open by May 2002. The government is keeping its promise to
introduce a competitive electricity market. We will do it, and we have put
the principles in place to ensure that we do it right.

Thank you.

This message came back to me (too big) - I am resending and will send 
garrett's paper separately.

__________________

Rob, thanks for the comments from the IMO Board meeting.  Three 
points:                               a) I am not sure what paper the IMO 
Board  members may be referring to.  It could be the briefing note re Moving 
Forward to Market Opening, the briefing note Satisfying the Government's Four 
Guiding Principles, or the piece on resource adequacy and pricing that 
Garrett Tripp prepared and that he and I have been delivering to senior 
people in the government and elsewhere.  I attach those three papers in 
electronic format.                          b) The briefing notes  above (and 
the material we are preparing for Ken Lay and John Lavorato) address the 
Pickering A point.  The suggestion that market opening is tied to Pickering 
A  doesn't surprise me but is at odds with what Judy Hubert has been telling 
stakeholders recently.  In any event, it is commonly thought that the 
government may think that Pickering A will improve reliability and stabilize 
prices.  There may, in fact,  be another reason.  One of our contacts in the 
Premier's Office has indicated  that  Farlinger had told Harris that  waiting 
until the return of Pickering was important from the perspective of OPG's 
financial position.  On reflection, Garrett Tripp and I think that the 
concern  likely relates to OPG's obligations under the MPMA - the concern may 
be a)  that OPG may not be able to claim "force majeure" in respect of the 
Pickering A delay in order to reduce their rebate obligations  ( definition 
of "force majeure"  in sec. 2(c) may not be broad enough) or b) that, even if 
OPG  can claim "force majeure",  the predetermined "force majeure replacement 
cost" fixed  at the time the MPMA was completed in 1999 may be too low to 
offset the cost to OPG of securing replacement power in 2001-2002.   In other 
words, OPG is asking the government to  intervene  in market 
development/market opening to protect OPG from the terms  of the deal (maybe, 
from OPG's perspective, now a "bad deal") that OPG made in 1999.  We should 
discuss whether Lay and Lavorato can make this point to Harris (without 
compromising our source).                       c) With respect to Foward 
Markets , I think we have to distinguish between  a binding hour ahead  and 
day ahead market which we may want to have the IMO run (assuming that this 
will facilitate  and standardize trading among the Northeast ISOs - which is 
a key objective in the East), but anything beyond that they should stay away 
from.  I will speak to Rob Hemstock and to the folks in Houston who have been 
working so hard on the RTO development in the Northeast.  Did  any material 
get circulated as to what they want to do re forward markets?  In any event, 
I think we should have a demo of Enron Online in Toronto for the IMO Board 
and OEB.          `

		 Subject: IMO Meeting Highlights

Some Brief Highlights from the 06/07/01 IMO Meeting:

 - Market opening, without question, is now tied to the bringing back of the 
1st pickering unit. Govt is clearly not thinking november but the good news 
is that they have made some statements locking them into may/02. We should 
have our own intelligence re Pickering return but Boland told me that March 
was highly probable.

 - A number of positive comments re Aleck's paper from board members - Aleck 
I'm not sure which paper they are referring to - can i get a copy.

 - Forward Market development - IMO "wants to make this happen". Assessing 
two candidates. I told the IMO that this is not their mandate and that a 
conditional forward market exists currently and an unconditional forward 
market will exist when we have a unconditional market opening date. I talked 
re Alberta and indicated that the Alberta sponsored forward market was a joke 
(WattEx) and that Enron and others had done 100's of forward market 
transactions and the Enron has a visible forward market 24/7. ACTION - We 
need to develop a position paper on why this should be left to the market 
place and not some regulated central agency. The IMO should be concerned with 
creating the right environment to promote an efficient forward market (ie 
information disclosure, etc). OPG would support this position - we may want 
to co-author the paper. I believe Hemstock/Davies did some work on this 
already re Alberta. Let's discuss further.

Aleck & Richard:

Just a quick update following my meetings yesterday in the Premier's Office.

Without question, the majority of decision-makers were leaning strongly
towards announcing a firm Spring 2002 opening date.

It has been conveyed to me that our (Enron/GPC) efforts prior to the
announcement by the Minister made a significant impact on the softening of
the announcement, making May 2002 a deadline and leaving the possibility for
a November opening.  While other stakeholders were advocating a November
opening (also largely thanks to the Enron/GPC effort, e.g. Board of Trade),
their arguments did not provide the same technical persuasiveness (with
concerns such as those regarding supply) as the Enron effort.  This
expertise coupled with sensitivity towards the political needs and pressures
resulted in an argument that surpassed those being made by some of the
industrials.

Recent comments by the Minister and others also suggest that the
government's message may change to "working towards November".  The
Lay/Harris meeting, our ongoing efforts to mitigate the influence of market
opening opponents, and our efforts to persuade decision-makers that the four
conditions have been met should help us meet our objectives.

We now have confirmed the following meetings for Lay and Lavorato: a) Wilson, 
Purchase and Hubert at 2:15 pm  ( Minister's Boardroom is booked  so location 
yet to be determined, but likely in Macdonald Block)  and b) Premier Harris  
and staff at 3:45 pm ( Premier's Office, 6th Floor, Whitney Block).   
Macdonald and Whitney Blocks about a two minute walk apart.   We will likely 
be out of the Premier's Office by 4:30 pm.  As I mentioned in an earlier 
e-mail, the only other meeting I would suggest, if you think there is time,  
would be with Floyd Laughren, chair of the OEB.   Our collective opinion of 
Laughren may not be high but he is obviously a key player in the  ultimate 
decision to move forward.  Let me know whether you want me to try to arrange 
that meeting or whether you think the other two meetings are sufficient.

FYI - column by Peter Foster of the National Post in today's paper.  Comes to 
the defence of Enron and Ken Lay.   Eric Thode has been very helpful to Peter 
and it has paid off. Also, I met with the Progressive Conservative Party 
Advisory Committee on Energy  (a committee of non-elected party activists) 
and they are preparing a report endorsing a Fall 2001 opening. 
Economics 90210

Peter Foster
National Post
Dumb ol' Dubya. President Bush and his administration have been taken to task 
this week by U.S. liberal economists and media sophisticates for being so 
naive as to suggest that California's problems won't be solved by price 
controls. That, sniffed last Sunday's New York Times, was just "Econ 101." 
What the President needed was a lesson in Econ 90210, presented by the 
Department of Sarah Polley-Sci.
The bad news for Californians is that the shift of power to the democrats in 
the federal Senate means that price controls become more likely, and with 
them more blackouts. Meanwhile, the real causes of the California crisis -- a 
screwed-up deregulation process exacerbated by environmentalist opposition to 
new state power plants -- are buried beneath screams about gouging and 
profiteering, and calls for an anti-corporate witch hunt.
The call for price caps has allegedly been boosted by the support of a "gang 
of ten" economists including Alfred Kahn, "the architect of airline 
deregulation under President Carter." But price caps don't work. As President 
Bush noted after meeting California Governor Gray Davis last week, "[P]rice 
caps do nothing to reduce demand and they do nothing to increase supply." 
However, according to another liberal economist, Princeton's Paul Krugman, we 
shouldn't worry about prices because this summer will see blackouts anyway, 
and in the longer term, new supplies are on the way via new plants, whose 
arrival will somehow be magically impervious to the prospect of controls.
Apart from being terrible economics, Mr. Krugman's attitude is even more 
objectionable politics. At least he is frank about the reasoning behind his 
support for price caps. They are intended to keep money out of the hands of 
power suppliers. Meanwhile, he pursues the conceit -- disproven time and time 
again -- that prices can be fine-tuned by bureaucrats to a level that will be 
"just enough" to call forth the right amount of new power. "Nobody," he 
writes, "has proposed capping prices at a level that would prevent power 
producers from making extraordinarily high profits; why should this reduce 
the power supply?"
Mr. Krugman suggests that students who go beyond naive old Econ 101 learn 
that "strictly speaking, the standard argument against price controls applies 
only to competitive industry. A price ceiling imposed on a monopolist need 
not cause a shortage; indeed, price controls on a monopolist can actually 
lead to higher output." This happens when the guy in the top hat throws up 
his hands and says "No point in me holding out for higher prices now that you 
clever wonks have capped them, so just come in and take what you want. And 
which way is it to the airport?"
Professor Krugman does have the good grace to note that "That's not an 
argument you want to use too often." In fact, the argument is dangerous 
nonsense. There is no "monopoly" supplier of energy to California (although 
many state politicians have called for a government takeover of the 
"commanding heights" of electricity generation, . la Lenin). Moreover, both 
the economic and political arguments against price caps remain as valid as 
ever. Price spikes require a buyer as well as a seller. To hold down prices 
means that there will be excess demand and that constrained supply will have 
to be allocated among competing uses by politicians and bureaucrats -- as it 
was under the system of natural gas price and transportation controls that 
brought the United States to crisis back in 1977. Meanwhile, the impact of 
such essentially arbitrary controls goes well beyond their immediate skewing 
of market signals. They damage the entire investment climate by raising the 
spectre of further whimsical intervention, and by establishing an effective 
ceiling to profitability without any corresponding limits to losses, except 
for those with political pull. Professor Krugman asserts that "generating 
capacity is being added so quickly that the industry will soon face a glut." 
If that happens, we may be sure that Mr. Krugman will not be calling for 
price supports.
Mr. Krugman has been a leader among the baying pack that suggests that 
California's problems are all due to market "manipulation" by big energy 
suppliers. He concludes his display of economic obfuscation with the snide 
assertion that President Bush's "knee-jerk ideologue" advisers may be "so 
close personally to energy industry executives that they believe that 
whatever is good for Enron is good for America." The presence in California 
of Enron, the world's largest energy trader, has increased supplies to the 
state, but according to California's attorney general, democrat Bill Lockyer, 
Enron's head, Kenneth Lay, should be sent to jail. After all, he did raise 
campaign funds for George Bush. And price caps and jail for business 
executives somehow go together nicely.

Kimberley, this is the material that is going to come in hard copies 
tomorrow.   I received a draft of Mr. Lay's speech today and I am now engaged 
in a substantial rewriting to include much  more Ontario content.   Final 
briefing material, to come next week, will also include  the outline of the 
speech, the final itinerary and profiles of the individuals that Messrs. Lay 
and Lavorato will be meeting in 
Toronto.

Guys,

Attached is my strategy plan for Ontario over the next four months.  I have discussed it with Paul DeVries and Rob Milnthorp and they are supportive.  

My market opening strategy dovetails with my thoughts on staffing in Toronto which are that we need immediate short term full time support for the next few for Enron Direct from either a contract employee/consultant/lawyer knowledgeable on Ontario retail and gas issues.  This person would be supported by me, Fino Tiberi, and Vinio Floris and may be offered a permanent position based on their performance during the contract period.  The project would be to do the assembly of pertinent rules, legislation, tariffs, etc that govern the retail gas and power markets in Ontario (same project Fino and Dave Vetsch are doing in Alberta).

On wholesale and market opening issues I intend to wait on replacing Aleck and instead rely solely on the market opening strategy (which includes my personal involvement) to cover off our advocacy requirements in Ontario over the next four months.  Coverage of more technical issues (eg those dealt with by the IMO Techical Panel) will be covered by me and Garrett Tripp (the trader in the Toronto Office who apparently has time given he is waiting for market opening).  I don't expect the technical work in requirements in Ontario will be extensive.  

Before the end of February, I will have a much better sense of the prospect for market opening and will then resume the search for a permanent Government Affairs staff member to assume Aleck's former responsibilities.  

Obviously nothing in this is written in stone, so I wanted to discuss with you guys preferrably today so or Monday morning.  I can be reached on my cell phone today at (403) 818-6797 (except between 12:00 and 4:00 your time when I am on a plane back to Calgary)

Regards,

Rob

I met this morning with three officials from the US Consulate: Mitchell 
Optican (Political and Economic Affairs Consul ), Patrick Santillo (Trade 
Consul) and Peter Dykeman (Trade 
Specialist).                                     They expressed the view 
that, from their perspective, there was a very real risk that  restructuring 
in Ontario will not proceed quickly  because of the political complications 
coming out of California.  However, the Consulate has  also made a decision 
to do what it  can to protect US commercial interests here -  the two 
interests they identified were those of Enron and 
Sithe.                                 They were  eager to explore  whether 
there was an interim step or half way measure that would protect our 
interests while allowing the government to play out the political agenda of 
proceeding (and being seen to proceed) cautiously. I suggested that the only 
such measure would be a scenario under which the IMO administered spot  
market (including the market for wholesale industrials)  opened this November 
and the retail market followed in the  Spring. There are arguments in favour 
of this approach : greater confidence in IMO system readiness compared to the 
distributor EBT/CIS systems; greater commitment of the IMO to market opening; 
likely support from OPG  to this since it could secure access to NY and 
proceed with FERC marketer authorization application;  it would enhance OPG's 
announced divestiture program re 4000 MW;  and consumers/distributors could 
be protected through a smoothed price plus a deferral account mechanism 
pending full retail access.                                              I 
explained OPG's position in NY where OPG had obtained a waiver of the NYISO 
tariff's "reciprocity" provisions on the basis of Dave Goulding's assurances 
in February 2001 that the market would open this year.  They understood and 
agreed that it was easier and preferable for  the Consulate to raise with the 
gov't the real potential that OPG's access may be lost unless the wholesale 
market opens this year.                                 I have committed to 
outlining a plan that focusses on wholesale market opening this Fall and 
providing it to them next week.  The model will obviously have to be 
consistent with the "four guiding principles" enunciated by the Premier and 
Minister of Energy:  "protecting consumers and offering choice", creating a 
strong business climate with a reliable supply of electricity", "protecting 
the environment", and "encouraging new ways of doing business and supporting 
the search for alternative sources of 
power".                                                                       
                                                                              
     We are meeting again on Thursday to discuss with the Consul General 
"Poncho" Huddle.   They are prepared to: a) get it included in Governor 
Pataki's  statements when he meets with Harris at a NY/Ontario  economic 
summit in Niagara Falls/Buffalo in late June, b) have the  new Ambassador 
include it in an early speech in Toronto, and speak to the Premier and 
others, and c) press the issue with their own contacts in Energy and Finance 
in 
Ontario.                                                                      
                                                                 Please give 
me a call if you have any questions.  I will develop the model with input 
from Paul and Garrett and Seabron Adamson/Kevin Wellenius.

With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty 
would have to be either OPG or OEFC.  In my view, the concept would not/could 
not  go forward and be implemented unless it had the support of OPG.  The 
question we should talk through  is how do we best try to get that support 
from OPG.                                        With respect to point 2, I 
think we should be careful about being  too encouraged by Wilson's 
/Purchase's comments  to Lay/Lavorato on June 19 that if positive reports are 
delivered by the IMO and OEB in September, the gov't  will be hard pressed 
not to move forward.  My concern is that Wilson and Purchase may feel 
comfortable saying this precisely because they are expecting a negative 
report from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being 
negative). I agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a 
positive report is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the 
OEB is far less certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC 
access to the data they need from HydroOne, completion of LDC CIS systems,  
the gov't's interest in an industry resolution of  customer duplications 
prior to market opening in order to avoid mass confusion in the initial 
period of the market, the  state of customer education, and a contingency 
plan to accommodate those who are not ready.                                - 
with respect to EBT, I think the best we can do is get onside quickly with 
our  EBT hub of choice  and work with them on perceived difficulties   with 
LDCs, etc.  Ellis, Marryott and I are going to make a recommendation to Paul 
next week on our preferred EBT hub.                          -with respect to 
the info from HydroOne, I  have already raised this issue with the OEB and 
the IMO. The OEB and the IMO subsequently met with   HydroOne and the MEA in 
an effort to resolve this issue.  My understanding, until yesterday's 
discussion with Conway, was that the issue was resolved  and the information 
was now flowing to the LDCs. Paul, Garrett  and I are meeting senior HydroOne 
execs (including Rod Taylor) on Monday re       resource adequacy issues and 
we can press this with them as well.                               - with 
respect to the CIS issue, there is not much we can do since most  LDCs 
already have a CIS vendor; but my understanding is that at least   one CIS 
vendor has backed out of its commitments to a number of LDCs recently (per 
David MacFadden) and perhaps we can get a vendor   to move in quickly to fill 
that gap. I will raise this with Marryott to see what may be feasible at this 
stage.                           - with respect to the customer duplication 
issue, I have already met with the senior people at Direct (last week)  to 
discuss this issue with them and to  propose a resolution that would see the 
retailers involved retaining a third party  (such as E&Y)  to assess the 
degree of overlap and whether   there was an acceptable solution to any 
problem. Direct is convinced that the degree of duplication is not high.  
Direct is talking to Onsource   and Toronto about this.  I am checking with 
our staff in the UK about whether there was a similar issue when the UK 
market opened and, if so, how it was  resolved. 
.                                      -with respect to customer education, I 
and Dick Perdue (Direct's advisor) have contacted TransAlta, OPG, HydroOne, 
Onsource, Enersource,   and Toronto about funding a  Province- wide consumer 
education initiative over the summer.  We are meeting next week to discuss 
this idea    further.  This could require a financial commitment from Enron 
of  up to $200,000.                              - with respect to the 
contingency plan to deal with those LDCs who are not ready, the OEB is 
already on side in recognizing the need for a contingency  plan - it will 
likely be very simple: the IMO  would send a bill to the LDC each month and 
the LDC would bill customers at some fixed rate, with a deferral  account). 
The key  issue will be how many LDCs (in terms of numbers and size)  are not 
ready and what is the minimum number of LDCs that   the OEB/gov't is looking 
for to be ready. This is an issue we will have to talk to the MEST about as 
well as the OEB , since ultimately the    decision of whether enough LDCs are 
ready will be a political one.                             These are the 
OEB/retail focussed things we are doing.  On the  larger political front, I 
have several  ideas about some things  I would like to do that I can discuss 
with you and Paul.

Garrett/Paul - Can you guys work with the North East desk to price out a 
500MW option at the New York/Ontario intertie as an insurance policy for the 
Ontario government re market opening. You will recall that this was something 
we had suggested a while back and didnt receive much support. However, 
following Lavorato's meeting with Harris, Lavo is adamant that we send a term 
sheet to Harris directly outlining both an call option structure and a swap 
structure. 

Second, it is quite apparant to me that everything hinges on the September 
readiness report. If its favorable, I think there is a good chance of a fall 
market opening. With that said however, we are in the hands of the IMO and 
the OEB. I'm comfortable that we can continue to influence the IMO to produce 
a favorable announcement but I dont know what we can do to ensure that the 
OEB says its ready. Any suggestions, comments? I dont want to be in a 
position that one LDC  could halt market opening.

Rick, this idea of a 500MW option  was first raised by me in February as a solution to the concern about the availability of the first Pickering A unit (515MW) during the Winter 2001-2002.  It was dismissed summarily at that time.

                    Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  
The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re 
the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if 
Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, 
it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  
of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry 
of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, 
Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy

Attached is a summary of the discussions at the meetings on June 19th.  I 
think that the meetings confirm that the key impediments to market opening 
are technical /systems readiness, concerns about pricing post-market opening 
, and Pickering A.   I will draft letters for Lay to Harris, Wilson  et al 
thanking them for the meetings and incorporating the data re Texas and 
Alberta that Lay and Lavorato used in the meetings.

		 Subject: RE: Lay/Harris Meeting

Rob, just to reiterate one point Paul and I were  trying to make on   our 
conference call  - We both  think it would be a  mistake to delete from the 
discussion with Harris et al  our views regarding prices and resource 
adequacy.  The biggest political  fear of the gov't going forward is that 
consumers will see a big jump in prices once the market opens.  For 
instance,  that fear underlies  the suggestion that  market opening should 
await the return to service of the first Pickering A unit.  - the idea (right 
or wrong)  is that Pickering will provide  greater reliability and price 
stability. The biggest fear  of the  government - based on our discussions 
with the politicians and their advisors  - is  the prospect of headlines in 
the Toronto Star et al about high prices in the IMO markets, whether or not a 
rebate is ultimately payable down the road. They saw the problems that  high 
prices posed for Klein earlier this year and are fearful of being caught in 
the same position. The Harris gov't is far more vulnerable than Klein  ever 
was.   We are concerned that it  is not an adequate answer to the gov't's 
political concerns  to say that high prices will simply increase the cashflow 
to the government's own coffers (via OPG) to be redistributed at some later 
date to  Ontario electricity consumers.  Remember that, in any event,  the 
MPMA rebate is calculated on the basis of annual revenues and that estimates 
are that consumers may not see an MPMA  payout until six months after the end 
of the year.  Our own extensive analysis and our own forward curves for 
Ontario indicate that significant price increases  (compared to the new OPG 
bulk power rate of $48 MWh ) are unlikely.  This is a reassuring assessment 
and we think it is important to share that view with gov't.   We can't rely 
entirely on the existence of the mitigants; we have to address the underlying 
concern about price spikes and high prices.  We think we have a good story to 
tell in that regard.  Pleased to talk about this further.  Aleck

Ontario Treads Cautiously Along Its Toilsome Path Toward Deregulation



By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis






[News item from Reuters] Ontario, Canada's plan to open its electricity mar=
ket to competition could happen earlier than the May 2002 target date, but =
the earlier timing is contingent upon the completion of a key report, a spo=
kesperson for the province's energy minister said earlier this week. "It's =
opening. We're just waiting to set a date and full steam ahead," said Chris=
tine Smith, a spokeswoman for the Ministry of Energy, Science and Technolog=
y. Ontario's government will make the decision regarding the start date for=
 competition once the readiness report, which documents the preparedness of=
 all the agencies involved in the privatization process, is completed and r=
eviewed by both Energy Minister Jim Wilson and Premier Mike Harris.=20

Analysis: The fact that the start of electric competition in Ontario, Canad=
a's most populous province, may actually be on the near horizon is a major =
development, considering that deregulation in the region has been in the wo=
rks-and has encountered several delays-since 1998. Shaken by the fiasco of =
direct access in California, along with the sudden price spikes that occurr=
ed in Alberta (Canada's only fully opened market), officials in Ontario hav=
e been rather reticent to proceed with dismantling the monopoly system in t=
his region. However, it now appears that Ontario is finally moving forward =
with its deregulation plan, despite concerns from some of the major players=
 in Canada that officials in the region have orchestrated what may become a=
nother troubled experiment in electric deregulation.=20

Before discussing the current deregulation plans in Ontario, it is necessar=
y to establish some key points about Canada as a whole, the province of Ont=
ario in particular and trends within the energy market of the Great White N=
orth. From a national perspective, electric deregulation in Canada is occur=
ring on a province-by-province basis (much like the United States is deregu=
lating its market on a state-by-state basis). At this point, only Alberta h=
as deregulated its electric market, which occurred in January 2001. Beyond =
Ontario, none of the other Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Manitoba, =
New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, Sas=
katchewan, or Yukon) have taken any definitive steps toward deregulating th=
eir electric markets and instead are approaching deregulation from a "wait-=
and-see" perspective. Part of this reticence toward deregulation among othe=
r Canadian provinces besides Alberta and Ontario relates to the generally l=
ow energy prices across Canada and the fact that the regions within the nat=
ion are vast and rather isolated from each other (thus making the issue of =
transmission interconnection a challenge). Ontario is an exception to this =
general rule, as the province has experienced relatively high prices and is=
 interconnected with other provinces and the United States.=20

As noted, Ontario is the most populous Canadian province, the home to 11 mi=
llion people with an average power usage of 155 terrawatt hours a year, and=
 representing a $10-billion electric market. The three main utilities in On=
tario are Ontario Power Generation, the former Crown-owned utility that was=
 formed by the replacement of Ontario Hydro Services Company with separate =
commercial companies in April 1999 and currently controls a total generatin=
g capacity of approximately 25,800 MW; Ottawa Hydro, which is owned by the =
city of Ottawa; and Toronto Hydro, which was created as a result of the con=
vergence between six utility companies serving Toronto. Toronto Hydro consi=
sts of a transmission and distribution unit and an energy services company,=
 but owns no generation of its own. Of the three, Ontario Power Generation =
has the market share in the province, reportedly serving about 85 percent o=
f Ontario's power market.=20

Deregulation of Ontario's natural-gas market took place in the late 1980s. =
Following plans that had been in the works since at least 1998, electric de=
regulation in Ontario was originally scheduled to begin in November 2000, a=
lthough it was postponed another 18 months due to concerns from officials a=
fter witnessing the well-documented problems in California. Energy Minister=
 Jim Wilson reportedly was also concerned about Alberta's experience with e=
lectric deregulation. Competition in Alberta's wholesale and retail power m=
arket began on Jan. 1, 2001, a time at which wholesale prices for natural g=
as were staggeringly high. High demand and short supply in Alberta caused r=
ates in the province to immediately double upon the onset of deregulation, =
a development that has naturally given great pause to other Canadian govern=
ments. Natural-gas and electricity prices in Alberta have since fallen dram=
atically, as elsewhere in North America, but not before the Alberta governm=
ent was forced to give hefty rebates to customers to compensate for the sha=
rp increases.=20

Under Ontario's evolving deregulation plan, retail markets will remain unde=
r the oversight of the Ontario Energy Board, the provincial power regulator=
, and are scheduled to open at the same time as wholesale markets. Under th=
e retail system, customers will have the option of arranging their electric=
ity purchases directly from suppliers at fixed-price contracts, or having e=
nergy purchased for them by distribution companies, agents, brokers, or mar=
keters at fluctuating prices. Most reports indicate that Ontario is well po=
sitioned to open its market to competition, at least from a supply perspect=
ive; in fact, Ontario government officials have claimed that the province h=
as adequate power supply, fueled mostly by hydro and nuclear energy, along =
with planned investments in new generation. However, other observers have c=
laimed that the delay in the start date for competition in Ontario is servi=
ng as a deterrent for new generation investments in the region. Reports fro=
m earlier in 2001 indicated that Ontario will need an additional 1,000 MW o=
f generation in addition to its existing capacity of 26,000 MW to meet dema=
nd, and only one 450-MW plant had been officially announced.=20

In addition, despite the assurances from the government, some companies hav=
e claimed that the deregulation policy outlined by the Ontario Energy Board=
 is fundamentally uncompetitive. For instance, one company that appears to =
have very little interest in the new opportunities in Ontario is Calgary-ba=
sed TransCanada Pipelines Ltd., Canada's largest natural-gas pipeline compa=
ny and a huge player in the country's regulated marketplace. One of the key=
 criticisms that TransCanada officials have raised is that the Ontario gove=
rnment is implementing a policy in which the bulk of Ontario's high-quality=
 generating assets will remain controlled by Ontario Power Generation, leav=
ing only undesirable plants on the auction block. In other words, even in a=
 deregulated market, Ontario Power Generation may continue to hold the mark=
et share of generation in Ontario. TransCanada claims that this approach wi=
ll diminish investment interest in Ontario and do little to entice new gene=
rating companies from entering the province. TransCanada, which has previou=
sly made acquisitions of natural-gas fired plants in Alberta and the northe=
astern United States, does not think that the province will offer a very co=
mpetitive market and appears to have little interest in moving into the Ont=
ario electric market. Note that in mid-October, Mirant Corp. (NYSE: MIR) an=
nounced that it had entered into an agreement to purchase the majority of t=
he gas marketing business of TransCanada, making it the largest natural-gas=
 marketer in Canada and the largest natural-gas exporter to the United Stat=
es.=20

Under the Ontario Energy Board's deregulation plan, Ontario Power Generatio=
n must sell or lease 4,000 MW of its non-nuclear power within 42 months of =
the opening of the Ontario market. Currently, Ontario Power Generation owns=
 9,700 MW of fossil-fuel capacity; 8,728 MW of nuclear power; and 7,309 MW =
of hydroelectric power. Obviously, the governmental mandate regarding the d=
ivestiture leaves the bulk of the province's generating capacity under the =
control of Ontario Power Generation, which is a major point of contention f=
or potential competitors.=20

It is important to note that the office of Ontario Energy Minister Jim Wils=
on does not share TransCanada's perspective. In fact, a spokesperson for th=
e office said generation assets such as the Mississagi hydroelectric system=
 and the gas-fired Lennox plant in southwestern Ontario, both of which Onta=
rio Power Generation will be divesting, represent very valuable assets that=
 should be a desirable way for companies such as TransCanada to enter the d=
eregulated market. Also note that TransCanada has expressed concerns only a=
bout opportunities in Ontario's electric market, and the company already ha=
s rather extensive gas-pipeline investments in the province. Nevertheless, =
enabling the opportunity for new companies to gain generating assets curren=
tly owned by Ontario Power Generation is a key factor to the success of Ont=
ario's deregulated market.=20

Moreover, Ontario inches ever closer to a competitive electric market, but =
a good number of concerns about the province's plan for deregulation remain=
 unresolved. There is great anticipation for the report that is expected sh=
ortly from the Ontario Energy Board, which may specifically address the div=
estiture policy for Ontario Power Generation that has troubled companies su=
ch as TransCanada. Certainly, there is great hope that no further delays of=
 the deregulation start date in Ontario, and that province officials either=
 maintain or accelerate the May 2002 start. Just as Canadian officials have=
 closely watched the move toward deregulation in the United States, U.S. co=
mpanies continue to monitor Canada's slow, province-by-province progression=
 toward competition. As noted, Mirant Corp. already has gained a market edg=
e in the natural-gas sector of Canada by acquiring the assets of TransCanad=
a. Duke Energy, Calpine Corp. and Devon Energy have also penetrated the Can=
adian natural-gas market with pending acquisitions of Westcoast Energy, Enc=
al Energy and Anderson Exploration, respectively. The next horizon for the =
Canadian energy market is electric deregulation, and industry eyes remain o=
n Ontario as the only Canadian province that is following Alberta into elec=
tric competition.=20

Aleck & Richard:

Please find attached a copy of our synopsis/analysis of President Bush's
National Energy Policy.

While you are of course familiar with all of the details of the policy, I
thought you may be interested in our interpretation.

In particular, you may be interested in our brief remarks with regards to
the implications for the Canadian industry at the end of the document.

As you know, one of our key efforts in Ontario is to build bipartisan suppo=
rt for opening the market in early 2002. That largely involves firming up t=
he position of the Liberal Party (currently in opposition but in a strong p=
osition to win in the next election) in support of moving forward with comp=
etition. The Liberal Party has asked me whether Enron (really someone like =
Rob Milnthorp or Paul Devries) might consider being the co-chair of a fund =
raising event for the party in November 2001. The event would be timed for =
the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest =
annual energy conference in Canada) and would be targeted at people in the =
Ontario energy sector. Dalton McGuinty, the leader, would speak at the even=
t.  I didn't dismiss the idea out of hand because it may have merit if : a)=
  through such an event, we can secure true bipartisan support for moving f=

 state that Rob or Paul is acting as co-chair in recognition of the biparti=

 is good for the Province etc); and b) we were satisfied that doing so woul=

The material re the hedge proposal has gone to Milnthorp and will go from Rob 
to Lavorato presumably today.  Our expectation is that there will be some 
discussion about the term sheet, prices, and letter early next week.  I would 
suggest that we get the Lay letters out early next week, without the 
reference to the hedge, because I suspect that the resolution of the hedging 
issue  by Lavorato , at al. etc. (particularly with respect to pricing)  will 
take another week.  I would rather not have that process further delay 
sending Lay's letters to Harris and Wilson.

                    Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  
The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re 
the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if 
Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, 
it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  
of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry 
of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, 
Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy 
Hubert is Judy Hubert, Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy, Ministry of 
Energy Science &Technology, 3rd Floor, 880 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A 
2C1.

Rob, after extended negotiations with British Energy, we have verbally 
settled on:

1.  Contract drop dead date extended to December 31, 2002
2.  Contract price of C$ 41.85/MWh.
3.  A number of small amendments to the contract that we (Chris and I) are OK 
with (Chris is preparing an Amending Agreement and memo for Peter Keohane to 
review tomorrow).

I am very happy with this as it still leaves a value of C$ 107 million (US$ 
71.3 million), and it extends the contract out 13 months from the current 
drop dead.  They were initially at C$45/MWh so we were able to squeeze them 
down a fair bit.  Realistically, there was a fair chance of not getting any 
of this power as they would only have had to give Falconbridge or Dofasco or 
any industrial a call and been able to fill this at $45/MWh in a heartbeat.  
Fortunately they still see value in having a contract with us for the future 
opportunities that may come up in the marketplace.   

We have left the discussion of the put swaptions from Bruce A to a later date.

Cheers, Paul D

 The point I didn't get a chance to finish this morning was that Sithe (the 
proponent of a major project- though many are skeptical ) have evidently told 
the Ministry of Energy that they are comfortable with a Spring 2002 opening.  
This is not helpful because generation investment has been key to the gov't's 
message re the benefits of competition.   The Minister has been using the 
alleged Sithe position to counter the argument that a Fall opening is 
critical to sustaining momentum and investment in the Ontario power 
sector.    I know the Sithe person here and he is very ornery (the former 
Chair of IPPSO) . I know that we have a major commercial arrangement with 
Sithe in the US.   Is there any one in Houston (Lay, Lavorato, Delainey) who 
can lever a more supportive position out of Sithe.                     With 
respect to the last point in my attached memo, I am wondering whether we 
could lever some senior US official to draw attention to the enormous profits 
that BC Hydro made in California and use this to make a case for reciprocity  
- "If you want access to our markets, you better open up Yours as soon as 
possible".  (Best do this in advance of Lay's meeting with the Premier).   I 
think the point is more obviously made re BC than OPG but  the point would 
not be lost on OPG which had revenues in excess of CAD $279,000,000 in 2000  
on 4.0TWh.   Most, if not all of that, of that would be from US markets.   In 
the absence of a FERC marketer authorization, all OPG physical transactions 
are done at the border.   In NY, even those border transactions require OPG 
to be a member of the NY ISO.  In order to become a member of the NY ISO, OPG 
had to get a waiver of the tariif provision re reciprocity.  They got  an 
extension of that waiver from the Management Committee  earlier this year 
only after a speech by Dave Goulding of the IMO to the Members Committee that 
the Ontario market would open this year.   That waiver will expire at the end 
of this year.   So OPG must understand that there is a serious risk that the 
waiver will not be extended if the market is not opened in accordance with 
Goulding's assurances.

Here is the term sheet that is going to be forwarded to Lavorato re the 500 MW.   He wants to send it to Harris et al.  I will send you a draft of the letter that should accompany it.  We may want to amend Lay's letter to acknowledge that a further letter from John Lavorato will be forthcoming under separate cover.

Rick, I spoke to Rob Milnthorp about this and he indicated that one of the purposes of the email was to simply disclose the key commercial and commercial support contacts and that he appreciated both the legal and government affairs individuals described are not members of EES Canada but are rather members of their respective groups.  It was clear Rob felt the memo was appropriate and I frankly didn't choose to engage him in any further discussion/argument about how it could have been written so as to more accurately describe how members of the Government Affairs Group in Calgary and Toronto will provide Government Affairs support to EES Canada.

Rick,

Aleck and I have recently discussed the prospect of adding another individu=
al to our Canadian team based in Calgary and Aleck invited me to prepare a =
description of the need and our circumstances for your review.  =20

I understand Derek Davies and Rob Milnthorp spoke to John Lavorato about th=
e need for additional support for our PPA exposure last week. They tell me =
that John agreed with them that we need additional transmission rate design=
 experience in-house in Calgary given we are exposed through our PPA positi=
on to considerable transmission rate risk.  From Derek's and Rob's perspect=
ive, the dedication of an additional individual to assist in managing outst=
anding transmission rate related matters that have not yet been addressed (=
and other issues that impact the value of our PPA) could be conservatively =
quantified as in excess of $Cdn 80 million over the 20 year life of the PPA=
.  While this person does not necessarily have to be in the Government Affa=
irs Group, my sense is that our group would be a much better fit than havin=
g the person join our commercial group.=20

Background

The Alberta Conservatives were re-elected with a significant majority in Ma=
rch 2001 and is now in the early years of a new four year mandate.  The new=
 Minister of Energy has reaffirmed the vision and commitment of the Alberta=
 Government to electricity restructuring which started to a limited degree =
in 1996 with the deregulation of generation and the creation of a power poo=
l and transmission administrator.  Effective Jan 1, 2001 the formerly regul=
ated generation was sold in the form of Power Purchase Arrangements and ret=
ail customer choice for all classes of electricity customers was introduced=
. =20

In late August 2000 Enron Canada purchased the 705 MW Sundance B PPA in the=
 PPA Auction for an up front price of $Cdn 300 million and assumption of th=
e fixed and variable costs over the 20 year (starting Jan 1, 2001) remainin=
g base life of units 3 and 4 of the Sundance B Power Plant of approximately=
 $Cdn 2 billion.  The Sundance Power Plant is owned by TransAlta Corporatio=
n and located west of Edmonton in central Alberta. =20

In Q2 2001 Enron Canada launched Enron Direct in Alberta which is a retail =
supplier of natural gas and electricity whose initial target market is comm=
ercial customers of all sizes.  Enron Direct recently began operating in On=
tario and will initially serve the same market segment as the Alberta opera=
tion.  Enron Direct's initial business plan does not involve serving reside=
ntial customers but it is expected that Enron Direct will expand its target=
 market to include these customers within 1-2 years.=20

Current Government Affairs Coverage

Fino Tiberi joined the Government Affairs team on May 15, 2001 and his focu=
s has been on dealing with market design and implementation issues that imp=
act the risk profile and profitability of Enron Direct's retail electricity=
 and gas business in Alberta.  In particular, the Alberta electricity retai=
l market is in the very early stages of development and the first 9 months =
of operation have revealed some significant design flaws in the initial set=
tlement process that have implications for Enron Direct.  In addition, othe=
r issues need to be addressed such as: exit fees, unreasonable distribution=
 tariffs, lack of oversight of municipal utilities.  The government has ind=
icated that one of its top priorities is address the problems with the pres=
ent retail market design.  Fino has also had some limited involvement in su=
pporting Enron Direct's retail initiative in Ontario and has recently began=
 investigating the current status of the retail gas market in BC with a vie=
w to advising Enron Direct on the requirements for entry and the market des=
ign issues that must be addressed. =20

It is reasonable to assess the task of influencing retail market design and=
 providing information/support to Enron Direct's commercial staff in Albert=
a and Ontario as requiring Fino's full time attention for the next 2 years.

Since Fino's arrival, my focus has primarily been on providing input and co=
mments to the Alberta Government, Power Pool of Alberta, Transmission Admin=
istrator and AEUB on wholesale electricity matters and to a lesser extent s=
ome retail gas matters (unbundling, code of conduct).  In addition, I have =
been working closely with the Enron Canada commercial and legal groups on n=
umerous issues that impact the value of, or relate to commercial opportunit=
ies arising out of, the Sundance B PPA position.  This includes issues such=
 as: Alberta Government approval to split the Sundance B PPA into two small=
er PPAs for resale by Enron Canada, treatment of the unsold PPAs, transmiss=
ion congestion issues, transmission tariff issues, energy import/export rul=
es, power pool rule changes.  Transmission issues are of particular interes=
t to Enron given Alberta's unique transmission rate design regime under whi=
ch suppliers in Alberta pay 50% of the transmission revenue requirement.  M=
any of these issues are complex and in many cases the implications of their=
 outcome impact Enron Canada's Sundance PPA position by millions of dollars=
.  For example, Enron Canada is leading a coalition of PPA Buyers (Derek Da=
vies and I will be on the PPA Buyer Coalition witness panel) that is presen=
tly involved in an AEUB hearing to contest the STS rate schedule proposed b=
y the Transmission Administrator that, if approved, will have the effect of=
 requiring the PPA Buyers to pay for transmission capacity that is used sol=
ely by the PPA Owners for their own financial benefit.  Enron Canada estima=
tes the value of it prevailing in this application over the 20 year life of=
 the PPA is approximately $Cdn 60 million. =20

Staffing Requirements and External Resources Going Forward

A number of key wholesale market issues are yet to be debated and resolved =
such as: transmission congestion, the consolidation of the TA and Power Poo=
l, the role of the Balancing Pool in managing the unsold PPAs, the future d=
esign of the transmission tariff (i.e. whether generator's should continue =
to pay one half of the costs of the deep/bulk transmission system), export/=
import transmission access, power pool price caps and other distortionary p=
ool rules such as those that exclude importers from setting pool price, aut=
hority of the market surveillance administrator, and amendments to the Elec=
tric Utilities Act in spring 2002. =20

My initial plan was to manage these issues myself and rely on the approval =
of RCR's to obtain ongoing support from the team of  external consultants I=
 have worked with (TCA, Frontier, Altitude Energy) to assist me in circumst=
ances where the issues are technically complex and/or where I am unable to =
commit the time necessary to develop Enron's position/input on an issue.  T=
his has worked, but it is clear that given the scope, complexity, and numbe=
r of the issues in Alberta that we must be involved in given the value at r=
isk of our Sundance PPA position, it can reasonably be concluded that the c=
ost of these resources over the next two years will far exceed the cost of =
a full time Director level Government Affairs staff member familiar with th=
e Alberta electricity market design and more specifically the Power Pool an=
d Transmission Administrator designs (including the TA's rates and tariff).=
  In addition, these consultants are much less accessible to our commercial=
 staff than a full-time employee.  =20

I anticipate the most substantial changes in the Alberta electricity market=
 design will occur over the next 2 years as this is the period during which=
 the Government itself, and via pressure on the institutions it oversees (A=
EUB, Power Pool, TA), will implement changes with a view to then leaving a =
period of two full years prior to the next provincial election for the mark=
et to respond.  There is a clear need for at least this period of time for =
full-time coverage of Alberta electricity issues alone. =20

Proposed Individual

Randy Stubbings is currently Director, Regulatory Affairs, at ESBI Alberta =
Limited (the Transmission Administrator) and is responsible for the TA's fi=
lings before the AEUB.  I have known Randy for approximately 4 years and ha=
ve found him to be an intelligent and reasonable individual who is well res=
pected by the Government, AEUB, and other industry participants. Randy is c=
apable of providing immediate and valuable advice and input in the developm=
ent of Enron Canada's participation in the transmission related matters tha=
t could impact Enron Canada, including the STS Rate Schedule issue (the hea=
ring will resume on Nov 19).  His technical background and experience along=
 with his long term involvement in various Alberta electricity market issue=
s would be of significant and immediate benefit to Enron Canada's commercia=
l group.  Derek Davies has had some limited dealings with Randy (and has wa=
tched Randy as one of EAL's witnesses at the STS hearing) and has been impr=
essed with his knowledge and expertise. =20

Randy called me recently to advise that he was interested in leaving ESBI a=
nd thought Enron would be a challenging and interesting place to work.  He =
advised that the current salary (including bonus) for a person of his level=
 at ESBI is between $Cdn 120,000 - 140,000.  If the position is approved, I=
 would propose we not proceed through the normal recruiting process but rat=
her immediately have Randy meet firstly with Aleck and I, then with Derek D=
avies, Rob Milnthorp and myself, and then with Rick Shapiro, Harry Kingersk=
i, Jim Steffes (in person or by video conference) Aleck and I.  I invited R=
andy to forward a copy of his CV to me.

Regards,

Rob

																				Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy Hubert is Judy Hubert, Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, 3rd Floor, 880 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A 2C1.

Eric, we are pretty sure the announcement will be that they will open the 
market by May 2002.  Today, senior political and bureaucratic staff in the 
Ministry of Energy have gone out of their way to stress that the announcement 
is designed to leave open the  real possibility of an earlier opening (i.e. 
in November 2001) if that is feasible.   As matters stand, I think that our 
response should be: a) We are pleased by the reaffirmation of the gov'ts 
intention to move forward with competition in the Ontario power market; b) 
our understanding of the position is that it leaves open the  real 
possibility of opening the market earlier, such as of November 1, 2001;  c) 
we continue to believe that an opening in November  2001 is feasible and in 
the best interests of Ontario (for the reasons set forth in Ken Lay's speech) 
; and  d) accordingly, we will continue to work towards a November opening 
and we encourage all others in the market  to do the 
same.                      Peter Varley of GPC is going to give you a call.

With respect to point 1 in your  memo, my sense is that the counterparty wo=

from the OEB (or at least one that they can interpret as being negative). I=
 agree with you that the likelihood of the IMO delivering a positive report=
 is very good. The likelihood of a positive report from the OEB is far less=
 certain. The key issues  at the OEB/retail level are EBT, LDC access to th=

Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a "native load" preference).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering ?lets say ?$1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external ?load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will ? ?be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? c)
Remember also that the scope for ?economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff ?($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately ?$4 ?MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh), ?plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost). ?Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.) ?Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners. ?(In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
 
? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE. ?Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck: ?Thanks for getting back to me so quickly. ?One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
 
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south. ?As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power. ?However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated. ?If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below). ?Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance. ?Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
 
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market. ?Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening. ?Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
 
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
 
Thanks,
 
Dave

David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are
correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic
export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the
economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative
generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling
tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including
exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion
costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the
connected market is congested. ?Everything else being equal, this means
that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in
the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be
conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said
that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover,
we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are
moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the
decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices) ?and extensive new
generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year
increase in ?available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is
about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability. ? Again, my
colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at
any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail. ?Give
me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points. ? 416 865
3707. ?Regards, Aleck

Thanks for the report. ?It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that
there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another
California.
 
The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that
energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by
imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on
higher-priced imports to meet demand. ? The first two points seem to
contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US
markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time,
putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market. ?If prices are
higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to
export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the
Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are
determined on the margin. ?Price volatility and extreme price swings were
also identified as concerns by MEUs.
 
Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any

Guys,

During the RCR Meeting last Monday an RCR of $30 K (US) was approved for legal and consulting support in relation to the ATCO Affiliate Code of Conduct Application.  I was asked by the RCR Committee to summarize the issues we intended to pursue once we had completed a review of the filing.  Below is an email I sent to our lawyer, Harold Huber, instructing him on the areas I wanted him to focus on in his cross examination and argument.  I believe these are fundamental code areas/issues that are of interest to Enron's operations in Alberta/Canada and therefore we should proceed to have our counsel pursue these at the hearing as was envisioned with the RCR request and subsequent approval.  Please let me know if anyone disagrees with me on this.

Regards,

Rob

Harold,

I have consolidated the relevant documents you have been working with to prepare your cross into one email for ease of reference:

a) Power Budd Preliminary Report dated July 20, 1999;
b) The Enron Code/Atco Code Matrix;
c) The Power Budd Code/Atco Code Matrix.  

For the purpose of confirming the instructions I provided to you, my interest is not to reduce your cross-examination to a word smithing exercise/negotiation with the ATCO witness but rather to put to the ATCO witness questions in specific areas that the ATCO Code has either addressed insufficiently or not addressed at all.  The very best possible result we could achieve would be for the Board to direct ATCO to refile a code that is consistent with the Power Budd Code with the exception that to the extent that ATCO does not incorporate a provision in the Power Budd Code it must provide the Board with an explanation as to why the provision was not included in the ATCO Code.

I recognize you have some concerns about putting the Power Budd Report on the record in the event ATCO can selectively use a portion of it to our detriment.  Based on my review of the Report, I think this risk is very small compared to the benefit of providing the Board with a comprehensive Report prepared by a consultant that was hired by the Alberta Government and consulted all affected parties in Alberta (including ATCO) prior to preparing the Report.  Therefore, I think you should try to get the Report placed into evidence. We can discuss this further if you disagree.

My sense is that the following areas of the proposed ATCO Code should be addressed in your cross-examination: 

1) Applicability of the Code

The ATCO Code must apply to all affiliates, not just ATCO's unregulated affiliates as ATCO has a number of regulated businesses in Alberta, the regulated affiliates of the utility to which the code applies must govern this relationship also.  See Vanderveen Page 15.

2) Non-discrimination (see PB Report page 12)

The absence of any reference to this by ATCO in their code other than the one sentence in the Purpose section leaves the code significantly deficient.  Our key concern here is that the code makes it abundantly clear that a utility must not provide its affiliates with preferential treatment relative to its treatment of unaffiliated companies.  See Blanks in matrix and PB Report page 13.

3)   Separation  (see PB Report page 13)

a) Separate Corporate Entity - Each regulated ATCO utility and should be a separate corporate entity from its unregulated affiliates.  I believe they have done this in their reorganization so they should not oppose this requirement in the code.  

b) Sharing of Facilities - Atco code is very brief and PB is preferable as it defines what cannot be shared.

c) Corporate Support - Clearly ATCO is advocating no restrictions on corporate oversight versus PB which talks about allowing it subject to some restrictions and emphasizes pricing rules.   

d) Joint Purchases - Atco has no requirement respecting appropriate cost sharing relative to benefit or mention of certain products or services that are not appropriate to jointly acquire such as the energy commodity.

e) Separate Officers - a limit of 1/3 of Board of the utility should not also be members of unregulated affiliates is reasonable.

f) Sharing of Employees - Atco want to share those who don't have access to Confidential Info.  Enron/PB advocate no sharing.  

g) Employee Movement - there should be a time limit (i.e. one year) on employees not being able to transfer back and forth between the utility and the affiliate. 

h) Other Sharing Prohibitions - see PB Code 4.6 (c) - (g)

4) Transfer Pricing  

The key point here is definition and application of "fair market value".  As per Enron Code, the onus should be on utility to prove product or service acquired at FMV.  See PB page 16.

5) Marketing and Advertising

Pursue the need for no joint marketing, equal access to written communication, clear rules on responses to customer requests for retailer information, provision of leads to affiliates.  See PB Report page 18.

6) Compliance Plan

Atco has no requirement for development of a plan or its contents.  See PB Report page 20.

7) Audit and Record Keeping

Atco has no audit requirements.  Atco should also be required to keep a complaints log and disclose the records it is required to keep to industry participants.  See PB Report page 21.

8) Enforcement and Penalties

ATCO Code has no provisions whatsoever under this category.  See PB Report page 22.

Regards,

Rob

Dave, Here is my response to the concerns raised in your e-mail below
regarding exports from Ontario to the connected US markets:
 
                         a) Remember that the rules and policies under
development at the IMO will ensure that load in Ontario will not be cut in
order to support export transactions (in other words, Ontario, like most US
systems, has adopted a "native load" preference).
 
                              b) Remember also that the Ontario market
clearing price will be set by the offers and bids within Ontario.
Scheduled external demand will move us up the bid stack but cannot, for
instance, set the Ontario price by offering  lets say  $1,000 MWh. The
price paid by all internal and external  load (leaving aside the issue of
congestion) will    be set by the marginal bid in Ontario.
 
                                                                  c)
Remember also that the scope for  economic export transactions will be
limited by the impact of the export and wheeling tariff  ($1 MWh),
liability for uplift (estimated at approximately  $4  MWh), and the IMO
administration fee (estimated at $1MWh),  plus any wheeling/admin charges
applied by the connected markets.
 
                                                                  d)
Perhaps most importantly, remember that congestion costs will be charged in
respect of export transactions from the Ontario zone (assume low cost) to
an external intertie zone (assume high cost). A buyer from the Ontario spot
market in the external intertie zone will pay the aggregate of the Ontario
market clearing price plus the applicable congestion costs. Those
congestion costs are calculated as the difference between the Ontario price
(low cost) and the price in the external zone (high cost).  Two
features/implications of this regime are worth noting. First, the liability
to pay congestion costs will by itself reduce the scope for export
transactions of the scope and level you fear. (Though one can buy
transmission rights - TRs - which will provide a complete hedge against
congestion costs.)  Second, the congestion costs collected under this
regime will, after funding the hedge held by the holders of TRs, be applied
to reduce the revenue requirement of the transmission owners.  (In other
words, the surplus flows back to reduce the transmission rates that Ontario
consumers would otherwise pay).
 
                                                                  Hope this
helps you and your colleagues on the PACE.  Happy to answer any other
questions that you may have.

Aleck:  Thanks for getting back to me so quickly.  One point that I forgot
to mention was the impact of external demand.
 
At the same time that Ontario generators would be trying to sell into
higher priced US markets, marketers serving US customers would be trying to
buy lower cost power in Ontario to ship south.  As you pointed out, both
groups would need to take into account the costs of wheeling and exporting
the power.  However, if the price differential between the Ontario and US
markets was sufficient to offset these costs, electricity would flow to the
US until the price differential for delivered power was eliminated.  If
demand exceeded supply in the US market by an amount equal to or larger
than the US intertie capacity, and Ontario was the lowest-cost supply
alternative, the total demand for Ontario power (from native and foreign
sources) could exceed Ontario supply under extreme weather (as shown in the
table below).  Under these conditions, the price in Ontario would be bid up
by the US market imbalance.  Alberta would have had a similar problem with
its BC intertie, if it hadn't decoupled its market pricing so that the
market clearing price for Albertans is set only by local demand.
 
A second and perhaps more critical issue, is the technical capability of
the Ontario market.  Despite the rosy reports from the IMO, some market
participants have experienced IMO failures during testing and most MEUs
have indicated that they cannot be ready for a November opening.  Many
people feel that the risk of system failure must be eliminated or reduced
to a manageable insignificant level, before the market can be opened.
 
I would appreciate any additional thoughts you care to share on these
points.
 
Thanks,
 
Dave

David, here are some observations in response to your questions: a) You are
correct that we would expect Ontario-based generators to pursue economic
export opportunities in the connected US markets but we stress that the
economics of such exports will be affected not only by the comparative
generation costs, but also the cost of Hydro One's export and wheeling
tariff, the IMO uplift and related charges charged to all load (including
exports), transmission costs in the connected market, and any congestion
costs arising in the event that the intertie between Ontario and the
connected market is congested.  Everything else being equal, this means
that on average, power will trade within Ontario at a discount to prices in
the U S connected markets. b) With respect to volatility, it has to be
conceded that electricity is the most volatile of commodities. Having said
that, the period of most serious volatility is the summer months. Moreover,
we think it can be fairly said that volatility and price swings are
moderating in the Eastern Interconnect largely as a consequence of the
decrease in fuel costs (i.e. natural gas prices)  and extensive new
generation build - PIRA estimates that in Summer 2001 the year to year
increase in  available generation resources in the Eastern Interconnect is
about 30,000MW. This all adds up to increased price stability.   Again, my
colleague, Garrett Tripp, and I would be ready to meet with your group at
any time to go over these questions and our analysis in more detail.  Give
me a call if you would like to meet to discuss these points.   416 865

Thanks for the report.  It helped to validate the PACE conclusion that
there is sufficient supply to open the market without precipitating another
California.
 
The report mentions that imports would not set the MCP in Ontario and that
energy savings would be possible even if peak market demand was met by
imports, while in another section it concludes that Ontario could rely on
higher-priced imports to meet demand.   The first two points seem to
contradict the results from the IMO test runs, which indicate that the US
markets will set the clearing price in Ontario 90 percent of the time,
putting upward pressure on electricity prices in our market.  If prices are
higher in the adjacent markets, Ontario generators can be expected to
export power to the more lucrative markets rather than bidding into the
Ontario market, resulting in higher prices for Ontario since prices are
determined on the margin.  Price volatility and extreme price swings were
also identified as concerns by MEUs.
 
Were any of these concerns addressed in your presentation and are there any
comments you can share?

FYI - two small articles in the Toronto newspapers  (and WSJ) got us in some hot water with the Minister's office. Seems okay now. 	Hope you are still coming on the 24th.  We should talk before you come about Canadian perspectives on the events of this week.  My own observation is that the events and the aftermath have highlighted how closely tied Canada is to the US and, in particular,  how closely tied Toronto is to New York City.

As you know, one of our key efforts in Ontario is to build bipartisan suppo=

the Independent Power Producers Society of Ontario conference (the largest =

1) The final version of my Ontario Electricity Market Opening Strategy, the funding for which ($215,000 Cdn from Nov 1/01 to Feb 28/02) was approved this week by the Enron Corp. Government Affairs RCR Committee led by Rick Shapiro. 

 

2) My thoughts on the prospect of the Ontario Electricity Market opening in spring 2002.

 
I can also advise that Enron Direct Canada Corp. received its Electricity Retailer Licence from the OEB yesterday.  This leaves only the Natural Gas Marketer Licence Application outstanding.

Regards,

Rob

Aleck,

You are exactly right -- disappointed but not at all surprised by the OEB's
extension.

You should know that I wrote very detailed briefing papers for Ambassador
Cellucci's initial visit to Toronto last June 27-28 on the power sector
opening issue.  I saw the briefing book upon his arrival for the visit and
the Ambassador had heavily underlined it.  I also spoke with him about the
issue at length during our drive down to Buffalo.  In other words, the
Ambassador is thoroughly briefed on the matter.  I also took the opportunity
at the evening reception following the Board of Trade breakfast on June 28
(your Garrett Tripp was at the breakfast) to speak with Pennsylvania
Governor Tom Ridge about his providing moral support to Premier Harris on
moving ahead with the market opening. Ridge spoke to the Board of Trade
about his state's positive market opening experience.  Governor Ridge said
he would make the point to Premier Harris at the earliest opportunity.
Another interesting development was that the PAC's Commissioner during the
successful Pennsylvania opening -- a Mr. Quain, is now in private consulting
practice.  It would seem reasonable for the OEB to spend some money to hire
Mr. Quain to review their progress so far and perhaps make some helpful
suggestions. 

Unfortunately, the Premier was not available for a meeting with the
Ambassador (Walkerton testimony was a day away) during that June visit.  I
hope that we can get this on a Premier/Ambassador meeting agenda at the
first opportunity.

By the way, I think the letter is excellently written, concise, and clearly
to the point.

Best, Mitch

Mitch, I am sure we are all disappointed, but not surprised, by the
OEB's 4 month extension of the deadline for the filing by distributors
of their second self-certification report. I thought that you would be
interested in the comments that we filed with the OEB regarding the
proposed extension. That extension will effectively kill any possibility
of a market opening this year.  If you have any questions or comments,
please give me a call.

Aleck --

Just wanted to give you some updates from my presentation in Toronto.

1. I used alot of material from Lay's speech.  Changed it a little.  I think 
I did ok (although I referenced airline competition in Canada - something you 
guys haven't yet put in place).

2. The general tone of the day was that Ontario has some more work to do.  It 
doesn't appear that the parties were really ready to move ahead with 
competition.  California wasn't discussed too much.  Many people are worried 
that the rules don't really promote competition - which they don't.

3. OPG indicated at lunch that they want competition, but that it was up to 
the parties in the meeting to make it happen.  Most people were in agreement 
(quietly).

Given the huge value loss for ENA if we don't get it open, I'd like to know 
if there is anything else we can do to help you.   There are some new 
Competitive Analysis guys that may be able to help us find some leverage - 
pls give me a call.  Finally, I saw Lavorato in the airport on the way back 
to Houston.  He is ready to help and recognizes the importance of this 
activity.  I think that he can get Lay and/or Skilling whenever through the 
Summer.

If you can push this through, this is a huge win for Government Affairs.  
This is easily the biggest Regulatory Origination opportunity we have this 
year.  

Jim

As you are aware a provincial general election was held yesterday in 
Alberta.   When the election was called the governing Progressive 
Conservative Party led by Ralph Klein held a strong majority of 63 of the 83 
seats in our Provincial Legislature.   The Liberals had 18 seats and the New 
Democrats (socialist) had 2 seats.

The two issues that dominated the election campaign were: #1 health care, and 
#2 electricity restructuring.   The PC's faced considerable criticism 
regarding their handling of restructuring.   The Liberals came out with a 
policy platform on electricity restructuring that envisioned the government 
taking back the PPAs "by negotiation or legislation, if necessary" at a price 
below market and using this supply to provide cost-based power to residential 
and commercial customers.  Only customers with load greater than 5 MW would 
be exposed to market prices.  The ND's policy platform was to scrap 
electricity deregulation entirely.  

Throughout the campaign the PC's defended their electricity restructuring 
policy and pledged to continue to protect Alberta consumers from the effects 
of rising natural gas and electricity prices.  To date, this protection has 
taken the form of natural gas and electricity rebate payments funded from the 
sale of the PPA's and from the provincial treasury.

I'm pleased to report the PC's enjoyed a landslide victory last night that 
appeared to even surprise them.  They increased their number of seats to 74 
of the 83 seats in our Legislature while the Liberals were reduced to 7 seats 
and the ND's retained the 2 seats they had.   With this new and significant 5 
year mandate, I am optimistic the PC Government will now be less focused on 
depressing short-term wholesale power prices and will be more prepared to 
focus on longer-term policy decisions and initiatives that will: i) attract 
new generation, iii) attract new retailers, and iii) give electricity 
restructuring a chance to actually deliver on the benefits it promised.    

We are well positioned to influence the Alberta Government going forward and 
I will be requesting further internal and external resources to help me 
develop and communicate our market design proposals further.   If Enron can 
help Alberta overcome the serious supply and retail market problems it 
presently faces, I can see a day when Alberta is held out as an electricity 
restructuring success story.     

Regards,

Rob

 The Premier's Office  (Didi Hayward) called  this afternoon to say that what 
she called the  "log jam" with respect to the proposed meeting has finally 
been overcome.   The Premier's Office has proposed the afternoon of  
Thursday, June 7 for 30-45 minutes  to be scheduled between the hours of 2pm 
and  4pm.    In my view, there is still considerable value in proceeding with 
this meeting  and hopefully Ken Lay could be available.   I would suggest 
that we propose the meeting to commence  in the 3:15 - 3:30pm timeframe,  to 
avoid the risk of the Premier being called back into the Legislature in the 
early afternoon and to increase the possibility that, if Lay and Harris are 
getting along, the meeting could run overtime without running into another 
scheduled meeting.  Please let me know how you wish to proceed in contacting 
Ken Lay about his availability, etc.  Regards, Aleck

The OEB announced earlier this week that they were  proposing to delay the deadline for the second stage of distributor self-certification re market readiness from August 10 to December 14.  The proposal is evidently based on the reports that the distributors filed on the first stage of self-certification on July 6.  Those reports have not been made public, so it is virtually impossible for stakeholders to comment on the need for or the propriety of the proposed delay.  I attach for your interest a copy of the Board's letter and a copy of my submissions to the Board re the proposal.  For what it is worth, the Minister's Office has told me that they are very "displeased" with the OEB because the OEB gave them no advance warning that a delay of the length proposed was being contemplated.

Met with GPC today re development of a regional media campaign and a program focused on keeping the Liberals on side (in addition to  our continuing efforts with the Government).  Can Ginger set aside a week of your time for a visit to Toronto and environs for that purpose -  sometime in October?  Once we get confirmation of your availability, we can proceed to schedule the events.  Thanks, Aleck -    P.S.           In any event, the President of GPC - Herschel Ezrin  (a very well connected Liberal)  - would like to invite you or Rob Milnthorp to the Prime Minister's Dinner (the major Liberal Party fundraiser) on Monday, September 24th.  Herschell has committed to introducing you or Rob on that occasion to senior federal cabinet ministers and key Ontario Liberal Party folks. Are you interested.  If you came on that occasion we would try to couple it with a meeting with Dalton McGuinty, Ontario Liberal Leader.

The material re the hedge proposal has gone to Milnthorp and will go from Rob to Lavorato presumably today.  Our expectation is that there will be some discussion about the term sheet, prices, and letter early next week.  I would suggest that we get the Lay letters out early next week, without the reference to the hedge, because I suspect that the resolution of the hedging issue  by Lavorato , at al. etc. (particularly with respect to pricing)  will take another week.  I would rather not have that process further delay sending Lay's letters to Harris and Wilson.

																				Rick, I attach drafts of letters to Harris and Wilson.  The revised letter to Harris refers to the letter that Lavorato may send re the hedge proposal.  That added language will obviously have to come out if Lavo decides not to send his letter or if, by the time Lay's letter is to go, it is still uncertain whther Lavo will make his proposal.   Address for copy  of Wilson's letter to Purchase is  Bryne Purchase, Deputy Minister, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, Hearst Block, 4th Floor, 900 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario, M7A 2E1; Address for copy of Wilson's letter  to Judy Hubert is Judy Hubert, Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy, Ministry of Energy Science &Technology, 3rd Floor, 880 Bay Street, Toronto, Ontario M7A 2C1.

Attached is the link to a very good article that appeared in the National

writer and interviewed Ken Lay when he was here. You will see the references 
to Ken Lay and Enron.  Terry phoned me yesterday to indicate he had decided 
against running the piece today,  after a discussion with Dave Goulding, CEO 
of the IMO.   Goulding had evidently told him that there was no immediate 
urgency to  the gov't announcing a date.  Dave's concern is that if we press 
for a date now we may get the one we don't want (i.e. Spring 2002 rather than 
November 2001).  I told Corcoran that I understood Dave's concern but that 
there was a need for an early indication from the gov't  that they were 
targeting November in order that we maintain momentum among those bodies 
(primarily the distributors) which bear the primary responsibility to get the 
needed systems in place.  Eric Thode is forwarding a copy to John L.

Attached is the draft retainer for Sasha Jacob's new firm.  I think the retainer is a bit rich.  I would suggest cuttimg it to  CAN $10,000-$15,000 per month and shortening the length of the contract to 6 months.

Aleck,

Ginger provided us with Enron's standard retainer earlier this week.  We
have made a few tweaks and I am waiting to hear from Sasha (who is currently
touring Sonoma) so I can bounce a few last minute touches off him.

In any event, we anticipate getting the agreement to you by the close of
business today (provided I hear from our wine-tasting friend) or Tuesday am
at the latest.  The effective start date of the relationship will be
September 4, 2001.

Please call or reply if you need anything else.

The new market readiness plan appears to target March 1, 2002 as the market opening date. I say "appears" because the bars in the GANTT chart end on that date.

Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December. 

In my mind, we actually gave credence to the OEB and to some extent gave them the mandate to defer market opening. Lets discuss when you have a moment.

Regards
Rob

		 Subject: Today's Meeting



Aleck,

First, thanks for spending time with us this morning.  I think it was a very
worthwhile meeting.

In your thinking about a scheme to satisfy Harris government political
concerns, please consider that the Premier said on May 1 that he is
insisting that before deregulation four conditions will have to be met over
the next 12 months. These are: a guarantee that consumers will be spared
from sharp rate hikes; a reliable supply of power; adequate environmental
safeguards; and continued support for alternative power sources.

I think we need, therefore, to consider how to freeing up the wholesale
market would not cross these four conditions.  For example, deregulating the
wholesale market would not appear to have any negative impact on
environmental safeguards or continued support for alternative power sources.
It may be that such a deregulation would have a positive impact (I noted in
today's WSJ that ENRON and 4 other companies are calling for CO2 caps).  How
could deregulating the wholesale market "guarantee the consumers will be
spared from sharp rate hikes" and "provide a reliable supply of power"?

I think that any plan for reducing market risk that ENRON could suggest (as
you mentioned, Ontario could contract for future deliveries at a set price)
would seem to meet that requirement.  What needs to be clear is the
mechanism whereby this would be done.

If an alternative plan is then contrasted with the consequences of ENRON
pulling out of the Ontario market and the reciprocity repercussions for OPG
in NY, perhaps the Harris government would have the political cover as well
as the incentive to qualify its May 1 statement to include a November 2001
opening for the wholesale market.

best, Mitch

precisely how, we will find out tomorrow.   The meeting is at 10:00am EST and 
I have contacted  Linda in the hope that some one from the Washington office

 FYI - a  joint letter from the IMO and OEB confirming their intention to 
proceed with market readiness by the Fall of 2001.                          
As I indicated earlier to Richard, I have been invited to a meeting with 
several people from the Premier's office on Wednesday  May 2  to discuss the 
announcement ( I have asked Paul Devries to accompany me; representatives 
from Centrica, Toronto Hydro and Enersource/Mississauga Hydro will be there 
as well).                                        I had dinner with Judy 
Hubert (Asst Deputy Minister of Energy whom John met at Ken Lay's speech) on 
Thursday evening: she was aware of the pending meeting between Premier Harris 
and Mr. Lay  and was enquiring about what Mr. Lay wanted to address - I 
indicated that Mr. Lay would want to make the case for opening the market in 
the Fall of 2001(as set out in his speech) and to share with the Premier some 
proposals for moving the matter forward. I also indicated that Mr. Lay would 
be able to provide the Premier with a useful  and honest perspective on the 
events in California and that hopefully , on a going forward basis, the 
Premier would see Mr. Lay as someone he could phone and talk to about those 
issues.  I will sketch out a draft of the proposed speaking points early next 
week.

Sasha Jacob indicated this a.m. that he does expect that Harris will announce his resignation at 10:30 am EST.  Assuming this occurs, I will immediately proceed to instruct GPC to modify the communications plan/strategy that GPC is in the process of developing and that I had a scheduled meeting to review with Tom McLaren in Calgary on Thursday.    

The leadership race will be a one member one vote process and Sasha expects Ontario will have a new Premier within 3 months.

I'll advise once I know more.

Rob

Rob - The lead story on CBC this morning is the rumour that Premier Harris may resign as early as today.  What can we do to understand how this effects market opening?  

The most likely successor is the Finance Minister Flaherty.  This would be good news as he is the most right wing of them all.  There are also rumours about Janet Eckker (sp?) whom I believe is the Minister of the Environment.  She leans left of center.

I thought that you would be interested in the feedback from the Board of 
Trade Electricity Taskforce meeting this morning:                          a) 
On the weekend, May 4- 6, the Ontario Chamber of Commerce unanimously adopted 
the Toronto Board of Trade's  position paper re market opening on November 1, 
2001.   The OCC is the umbrella organization of all local chambers of 
commerce/ boards of trade across Ontario.  The Toronto Board of Trade 
position paper largely follows the Enron position paper re market 
opening.                              b) Elyse Allan, Louise Verity and Jan 
Carr (all representing the Toronto Board of Trade) met with Minister Wilson 
and Judy Hubert on Tuesday, May 8. Wilson explicitly asked the BOT to "keep 
up the heat" on a November 1 opening. Wilson was evidently very impressed by 
the OCC resolution.                       c) Some concern was expressed  by 
David McFadden (head of SAC and BE's lawyer)   that  OPG may not put the 
fossil units on the block until August, since the Ministry of the 
Environment's new emissions regulations will not be promulgated until that 
time.  Paul might want to raise this with Gord Homer: I don't see why OPG 
would have to wait until August  to begin the process; the substance of the 
regs are known now, even if they are not law until 
August.                       d) A fight is brewing between the City of 
Toronto and the Province regarding the Hearn facility.  The City wants to 
tear it down  as part of their waterfront plan but the Province is pushing to 
keep it as a generation facility of some type. The IMO has evidently prepared 
a report on the issue that has not yet been made 
public.                                        e)There was a push from some 
taskforce members (particularly Jan Carr) to adopt, as a transitional 
measure, some type of controls to limit exports and control prices in 
Ontario.  This was a non-starter with most of the members of the taskforce 
and that initiative will not go forward. I have undertaken, instead,  to give 
the BOT some talking points that they can use in answering questions about  
interregional trade and the type of comments that Howard Hampton  (NDP 
leader) is making about the US sucking cheap power out of Ontario.

logos of the signatory companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck 
Dadson worked with GPC on its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which 
includes Ken Lay's visit to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government

As I discussed earlier with Rick, sasha Jacob is leaving GPC at the end of the month to join another firm.  sash is particularly valuable becuase of his impeccable connections with Jim Wilson (the Minister of energy) and the staffers on the government side of the Legislature.  What I wouldn't mind talking through with you is the continuing need for assistance re the media here, as Tom McLaren proposes. I think we need it and Peter Varley would be good to work with in that regard - he is the Premier's former Press Secretary and has conections with the major Toronto dilies that have proved helpful.

Aleck:

Further to our phone call, as promised I am sending you this e-mail to
confirm our interest in ensuring that Enron Canada can secure the consulting
resources it requires at the current time to ensure an expeditious and
assured opening of Ontario's electrical power market. As well, as you know
we have superior resources in Alberta and elsewhere to augment your
government relations, media and public affairs resources.

I would like to meet with you today or early Wednesday to discuss an amended
going-forward task assignment for GPC, given the likelihood of assigning the
Queen's Park contact program to Sasha, or his new firm. I would ask that
should you be successful in concluding an engagement agreement with Sasha or
his firm that you inform us and I will have our in-house counsel confirm the
removal of any restrictive covenants that Sasha has with GPC that would
prevent him from doing consulting work with you.  

While the contact program you want Sasha to work on is key to your
objectives, it is nonetheless only one element of a comprehensive campaign,
so whatever your arrangements with Sasha or his firm may be, we see GPC's
critical areas of support as follows.


	*	GPC would continue to provide strategic advice on the
overall program to secure Enron Canada's market opening in Ontario,
including advice to you on the Queen's Park Contact Program. Assuming that
you will be working with Sasha to execute the Queen's Park contact program,
we still believe that our assessment of the situation will be very valuable,
particularly with the opposition parties and for giving you an independent
back channel to gauge your success. 

	*	GPC would also provide advice to you on the management of
other important stakeholders, such the municipal utilities, major power
consumers, consumer and environmental/social advocates and others who may
slow down or derail the market reforms.

	*	Regarding the opposition parties, we endorse your strategy
of maintaining the current support of the Official Opposition Liberals. GPC
is well positioned to assist in this political arena. It should be separated
from the government program in our view if possible.

	*	The media will also perform a pivotal role in shaping the
public's understanding of the issue. In this respect, we would recommend
that GPC's Peter Varley assist you. Our approach would be to ensure that the
major media outlets in key government constituencies are targeted to have an
accurate and favourable response to Enron Canada's position. Ideally, we
would work to ensure that these outlets are proactively supportive of the
market opening in their respective editorial positions and that Enron is a
preferred media contact. This would enable you be in a better position to
shape the media debate. To accomplish this we would recommend both a
proactive and reactive approach - i.e., media plan, contact program, program
delivery and day-to-day monitoring and rapid response (Aleck this is much
like we did for project Stanley).

	*	GPC would also develop all collateral materials for all
audiences including the media, government, regulators and market
stakeholders. This would include briefing notes, Q&A, media releases, policy
papers etc.

	*	Outside Ontario, there are other concerns, including some
current issues underway in Alberta, which Enron Canada should be alerted to
from time to time and GPC can help you understand those concerns as they
arise and assess the value of strategic intervention.  
	
As we discussed, I will be the overall account manager for GPC and I
strongly recommend that you, Sasha and I meet as a team twice a month to
coordinate our efforts and to exchange intelligence.  

I have also reviewed our current contractual arrangement with you (our
letter agreement from 08 June 2000) and I believe a new contract is not
required as our current contract would seem to be appropriate. It sets out a
comprehensive set of deliverables which covers all the points I have
outlined above, and an agreed understanding between you and me on a budget
will fit within the terms of that contract.

Once again Aleck, thanks for your support and patience and, as you can tell,
we value your business very highly. 

I will call you to set up a convenient time to meet to ensure this overview
is consistent with our discussions and also to review with you the members
of the GPC team.

Rick, here are my comments: 
There was never any alternative on the table but to align ourselves with the IMO/OEB Market Readiness Plan.  It was never going to be possible to open the market without sufficient technical readiness on the part of the central institutions in the market - the IMO and the distributors.  We could not reasonably expect the Government to open the market if the primary regulator - i.e. the OEB -  was saying that the distributors were not ready. Anyone who thinks otherwise is dreaming.
We were instrumental in getting the OEB to adopt the  "aggressive" timetable that they did.  The distributors see us as being the main party pushing for tighter timelines etc. (And don't like us for it). There was little we could do (subject to what I  say several bullets below) to effect readiness other than pushing for the OEB to enforce timelines. 
Contrary to what Rob says, at no time was it our position that it was highly likely that the OEB report would be positive. See the bottom of the first page of our briefing note for Lavorato and Lay (attached) where we express uncertainty regarding distributor readiness.  Certainly our public position on readiness was upbeat - precisely so we could press our other positions re pricing, Pickering, etc. 	Those arguments would have been irrelevant if there was no prospect of sufficient technical readiness.
Our whole objective since April has been to keep November 2001 alive as prospect - so long as there was sufficient technical readiness (a factor over which we had little control).  
Just so you know,several months ago,  I raised the possibility of pushing for a split wholesale/retail opening and was told not to do so - because of the adverse commercial implications re the British Energy contract renegotiation. .  In any event, I think sticking with a single market opening is the correct approach - because it puts the stronger institution - the IMO - in the position of having a strong interest in pushing/pulling the weaker one - the OEB - along. 
Just so you know, several months ago, I raised the possibility of Enron Canada investing more resources in developing or securing from otherssuppliers  CIS systems etc. that could be made available to the distributors to get them ready.  This was dismissed. 
My expectation for several weeks (prior to the OEB report) was that the report would involve some delay (length uncertain) in retail market readiness.  Paul and others were advised.  
My understanding is that the IMO and IMO Board of Directors were informed of the OEB report the day or two before it was issued.  Milnthorp made it clear to me that he was afraid of telling Lavorato and left it to me to do so (via the material for Harris). I our conversation, Milly blamed the Chair of the IMO Board for caving in.  He never expressed the views set forth in his memo to you. 
Also, it is worth noting that the OEB report took the government - both the Ministry and the Premier's Office - by complete surprise.
Having said all this, I have to say that Paul has been fully supportive and nothing herein should be read as a criticism of him.

Rick, as you are likely aware, Ontario market opening has once again been pushed back with March 2002 likely the earliest possible start. From a strategic standpoint, you will recall that we decided to align our interests with the outcome of the OEB/IMO readiness report due out in September. Our regulatory position was that it was highly likely that the outcome of this report would be positive and by supporting this initiative it would push the government to immediately open the market (likely November 2001). In the interim however, the OEB has unilaterally deferred market opening to 2002 with the deferral of stage 2 of the self-certification process from August to December. 

In my mind, we actually gave credence to the OEB and to some extent gave them the mandate to defer market opening. Lets discuss when you have a moment.

Regards
Rob

__________________

 I spoke with Bill Hawkins (Premier's Office)  to day and made the following 
points: a) the messages from the Premier/Wilson are still ambiguous and 
unclear; b) we will need clarification on three questions: 1) Is May 2002 a 
deadline (as per Wilson) or a target (as per Harris)?; 2) Is the gov't still 
prepared to consider a Fall opening if the 4 conditions are met?; and 3) Is 
the return of  the first Pickering A unit a pre-condition to market opening? 
- if it is, then any question about a Fall opening is moot since the earliest 
that unit will come back is December 31, 2001 (and more likely 
later).                          I did not press Bill for answers today but 
indicated that we would need clarification on these issues as soon as 
possible to stay engaged in the way that he wants us to. I outlined the 
interpretation that we had been encouraged  by Ministry of Energy to put on 
the message.  Importantly, Bill did not "shut down" our preferred 
interpretation.                                     Bill made three points: 
a) the critical factor in the announcement was continuing concern about the 
circumstances in California and the difficulties that California presents for 
making the decision to press ahead this year;   b) on the political front, 
the key opposition to moving ahead will come from the NDP rather than the 
Liberals: he wants us to help keep the Liberals on the sidelines;  and c) the 
gov't  (Ministry of Energy) is going to work on fleshing out over the next 
several weeks how they will assess when the 4 conditions will be satisfied 
and he wanted our help in that 
process.                                             I told Bill that we 
wanted to stay engaged but that our immediate interest was getting 
appropriate clarification of the message.                        Following 
Bill's call, I heard from Joel Singer, VP at OPG, who indicated that Floyd 
Laughren had assured OPG yesterday that the OEB was still targeting a Fall 
opening in its retail readiness efforts.  Singer did indicate, however, that 
OPG's  own demand supply assessment was not  as positive as our own and that 
concerns about the demand/suppy balance was continuing to be a big hurdle to 
get over.                            The IMO is also sticking with its 
testing/commissioning timeline and is not altering it in light of the 
announcement on Monday.                          `

Attached is a summary of the discussions at the meetings on June 19th.  I think that the meetings confirm that the key impediments to market opening are technical /systems readiness, concerns about pricing post-market opening , and Pickering A.   I will draft letters for Lay to Harris, Wilson  et al thanking them for the meetings and incorporating the data re Texas and Alberta that Lay and Lavorato used in the meetings.

Subject: Proposed Enron Canada Advocacy Position on Gas Utility Hedging

As I have previously advised, there is an AEUB hearing scheduled to commence 
next week in Alberta that will address the issue of Atco Gas hedging the 
price of its default supply offering to customers in Alberta.  I am trying to 
finalize my instructions to our counsel on the position Enron Canada will 
advocate in relation to utility hedging of default gas supply. 

Atco is the primary gas utility in Alberta serving in excess of 90% of the 
natural gas customers in the province.   Based on the terminology that was 
recently used by Dan Allegretti and Sue Landwehr in their memo to Dave 
Delainey of April 13, 2001 's I would describe the Alberta gas market as an 
"open access jurisdiction" as Atco has existing transportation rates that 
allow "core customers" (residential, commercial, and institutional consumers) 
to purchase the commodity directly from a retailer.   

For the purpose of this hearing it is beyond the AEUB's jurisdiction to 
replace Atco as the default service provider by mandating the selection of 
one or more default service providers through a competitive bidding process.  
Also, in separate hearings the AEUB will be considering the issues of: 1) 
more complete unbundling,  and 2) the treatment of natural gas production 
assets that are presently subsidizing Atco's gas costs.  

Given that Enron is in the process of reconsidering its position on utility 
hedging and, more particularly, we have a vision of EES "sleeving" products 
to customers through the regulated utility, I thought I better brief you on 
the position I would like to advance in relation to Atco Gas being mandated 
to hedge default supply for its core customers: 

Atco should not be directed by the Board to use financial hedging to fix the 
price of natural gas supply to its core default customers as this could 
impede the development of the competitive retail market and/or delay entry of 
new retail participants
the development of a competitive and functional retail market is in the 
interests of core customers.  With the entry of new retailers will come a 
variety of new commodity pricing and term offerings 
the pace of entry on new retail market participants should not be a function 
of what will ultimately prove to be favorable or unfavorable hedging 
decisions made by the incumbent default supplier (i.e. unfavorable hedging 
decisions may actually accelate the development of a retail market subject to 
this being impeded by the introduction of exit fees to mitigate the stranded 
costs that may result from poor hedging decisions and subsequent customers 
exercising choice).  
it is adminstratively cumbersome and difficult for the Board to approve 
hedged rates as it would have an obligation to assess and make determinations 
respecting Atco hedging decisions.  
commodity price choices should be made by the customer who will be subject to 
the risks and benefits of this decision.  The decision should not be made on 
behalf of all default customers by their default service provider
the Board should focus its attention on the following two issues rather than 
on mandating hedging: 1) directing more frequent (rather than seasonal) 
default service commodity rate adjustments so Atco's actual monthly gas costs 
are more closely reflected in its default service rates; 2) the upcoming 
unbundling proceeding where the Board should ensure that unbundling 
principles are adopted that will result in Atco's default supply commodity 
costs not being subsidized by improperly functionalized costs from other 
distribution business functions.

I apologize for the short notice but your advice on whether my position is 
okay would be appreciated by tomorrow.  

Regards,

Rob

Rick, 
 
Look like London HR have put forward Bruno Gaillard as a possible transfer back to NA.  My sense is that Bruno is much too junior (and perhaps not as polished) relative to what I'm looking for in Toronto but I thought I would share this with you anyway and see if you disagree with me.

Essentially, if you have any ex-Canadians who might be interested in commercial or commercial support roles, we would certainly entertain the idea of hiring here.
