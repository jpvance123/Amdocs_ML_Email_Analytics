George,

The following are my answers to your questions:

1.  No.

2.  The nomination is at the pay meter 9862.

3.  In the past, this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet.  It has been 	      maintained by the Risk group.

4.  As of 4/24/01, Comstock's nomination is 43,681 and Kerr McGee's is 29,037.

5.  This purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet.  It is maintained separately on a file by Daren.  To the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase.

Bob

Bob,

Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:

1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?

2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?

3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.

5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.

George

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes Deal # Price    Period  Global No.
Suemaur Explor & Prod  9881   1300mmbtu/d 709716 100% GD less $0.10

this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

Bob, 

HPLC will be purchasing wellhead gas from the producer listed below for the 
production month of July.  This production will be purchased on a "spot" 
basis and a deal ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on 
the following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    

Cody Texas, L.P.   5333   2975mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.09

This ticket should be marked evergreen, so that it rolls month to month.

Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM 
Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.

Hillary, 

I noticed deal 305549 has just been put in for one day (6/1/00).  We have 
flow at this meter during the month of June, so could this ticket be changed 
to go through 6/30/00?  

Thanks you,
Melissa

Bob,

I'm still concern about April's nom; if we don't take it to zero, than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to Barrett's April deal.  This would be incorrect.

Bob,

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from Barrett Resources, Ocean Energy and Seneca Resources?  They were on George's spreadsheet but they are not termed up.  The only deals termed up are Mariner, St. Mary Land, Walter Oil & Gas and The Meridian Resource.

Bob,

I have a volume of about 713/Day at the above referenced meter.   I don't 
have a deal in the system to allocate to for October (flow began on 10/11).  
This is hitting my Exception report.  Please advise.

Daren,

I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close

Mary:

Is the issue below confirmed volumes versus actual flow?  The large variance 
between confirmed and actuals began in June 2000 where 30 MMBtu was scheduled 
for Dix Ranch and zero for the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.  It 
appears that the volumes for these wells were scheduled at Despain where 
985,350 MMBtu was confirmed.  This well has never flowed this much volume, 
and in June 2000 it flowed approximately 320,000 MMBtu.  Do we actually have 
support (i.e we talked with someone or have a nom sheet) for the 985,350 
MMBtu that was entered into MOPS as confirmed?  This trend of "nothing" being 
confirmed at these three wells continued until July 2000.  In August 2000 
this scenario changed and 612,388 was confirmed at Dix Ranch and nothing was 
scheduled at the Big Cowboy and Big Cowboy #2 wells.

>From reading your memo below it also appears that more volume is flowing at 
these wells that we expected.  If the issue is an actual increase in the 
volumes flowing at these wells, I would suggest that you call our Gas 
Measurement department and ask them to audit Coral's charts. Coral may be is 
calculating the volumes incorrectly.

This could also be an allocations issue.  The allocation as it is in the 
System today closely agrees with the allocation statement that I receive 
monthly from Karen Lambert at Tejas.  The only differences between the Tejas 
schedule and what is in MOPS are the Acock production and Gain or Loss which 
are not scheduled and therefore not allocated.  I know that you are working 
on the Acock production and Tom Acton and I are working on the Gain/Loss.  
Tom will tell me how to path the gas so that I can set up accounting 
arrangements for April 1999 forward.  Scheduling will have analyze and 
possibly rework January through March 1999 because these months were 
originally set up in POPS.

I want to help, so if I have missed the issue(s) would you please clarify it 
or them for me and let me know if I need to do anything for you.  

Thanks,

Fred

Subject: Big Cowboy for August

Daren & Tom,

Beginning with August production, I noticed that Big Cowboy, into King Ranch 
appeared to be flowing approximately 9M over the nomination/day.  Per a 
conversation I had with Fred Boas today, I discovered that two wells with 
zero noms flowed a considerable volume.

They are as follows:

 Rocher Big Cowboy (27002) - 42,000 approx.
 Big Cowboy #2 (27003 - 84,000 approx.
  Total flow:  126,000 MM's, more or less

I think that this may be part of the production increase which we are trying 
to account for, in addition to the Acock production at the Briscoe well which 
came on in August.  Please let me know what you think.  I would like to make 
sure that we are capturing our purchases correctly for both accounting and 
our economics.

Thank you,

Mary

I checked metered daily, and this has been on since the first of October, we 
had a purchase deal in place for the first 10 days, which went to zero from 
the 11th forward.

George,

The following are my answers to your questions:

1.  No.

2.  The nomination is at the pay meter 9862.

3.  In the past, this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet.  It has been 	      maintained by the Risk group.

4.  As of 4/24/01, Comstock's nomination is 43,681 and Kerr McGee's is 29,037.

5.  This purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet.  It is maintained separately on a file by Daren.  To the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase.

Bob

Bob,

Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:

1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?

2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?

3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.

5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.

George

Daren,

I talked to Vance and he said it was the same well that he nominated during bidweek.  I will ask Julie to change the price to Gas Daily.  Thanks.

Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Vance,

What is the price and volume that should be entered for October?  Apparently, 
Engage changed their name to Coastal was the reason the deal ticket was 
created that way.

However, I'm not sure why the ticket was created in the name of Coastal; it 
should have been in the name Engage Energy US, LP.  As for October, HPLC is 
buying this package of gas on a "spot" basis and a ticket should be created 
and entered in to sitara.

Thanks,

Vance,

On August 28, you sent a request to enter a spot ticket for September 
production on Engage Energy, meter # 5848, 240 mmbtu/d.  The ticket was 
entered as a purchase from Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P.  A volume of 304 
mmbtu flowed on meter # 5848 on 10/1/00.  Should there be a spot purchase at 
meter # 5848 in October?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob - there is flow at meter 5848 for 10/1.  In Sept. it was on a Gathering 
contract on deal # 382621 for Coastal Merchant Energy.  Could you please 
check to see if there should be a deal for October?

Thanks.

Subject: New Production-Sitara deals needed

Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and 
entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Deal #  Meter   Volumes  Price    Period
Cokinos Natural Gas Co.   327963  9842   2,800mmbtu/d    96% Gas Daily    7/6

Upstream Energy Services 327964  9844       150mmbtu/d  100% Gas Daily less 
$0.14 7/8 - 7/31

FYI, Susan will create and submit committed reserves firm tickets for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of August.  Additionally, 
these are Producer Svcs. deals and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,

Subject: Re: Meter 0980438 - Acock Production ??????  

I have spoken with Clem, this meter is now "non-allocatable", not unlike 
meter 8751on Big Cowboy.  This meter needs to be set up as a Receipt Meter 
attached to the Gulf Energy 27-009-08 agreement.  This gas began flowing on 
7/7/00, so deal ticket 380710, which begins 9/1/00 will need to be backed up 
to July to account for the purchase of this production.

Bob:  Please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that I can have 
Fred set up accounting arrangements on Gulf Energy.

Fred:  Can you please determine whether or not we have paid CCGM for this gas?

Once again, thank you all for your assistance.

Mary

Vance,

The issue is that the 4229 meter has been terminated in the system, per 
Cheryl Jones, effective 2/00.  Therefore, any purchases at that point, for 
02/00 forward, are UA4 and are probably having a negative impact on your 
accrual.  I think perhaps this deal should be backed up to a wellhead level?  
There have not been any measured volumes at 4229 since its termination, so, I 
don't know where exactly the term Calpine deal is, physically.  Your 
assistance in clearing this up is greatly appreciated.

Mary

FYI - 

It apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12/99 - 
04/02/00, were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase.  
Therefore, Vance explained to me that the volume of 1,517 Dth for the period 
should have been allocated to the Strangers agreement, just as it was.   Any 
deliveries were unauthorized (UDOG) and the gas then belongs to HPL.  Please 
give Vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue.

Thank you all for your patience and assistance.  I appreciate it!

The Heatherlock deal had a Single Transaction Agreement attached to it.  When 
the contract ended the deal ended.

The other two I believe we just need a email from Vance or Donald setting up 
a spot ticket.

Vance could you look into that?   Do I have the wrong contract attached?  Or 
is there a new contract.  for Camden & North Central, are those just going to 
be spot tickets?

I have rolled or input the following deals for October.

Crosstex 138553  2

Tri-Union 418432  700
Vintage  403367  300
Whiteoak 418434  96
Whiting  418436  100

So, I am showing that the only deals we have outstanding for Oct are:

Camden/9858  3000
Heatherlock/6879 544  (previous deal#133010)
North Central/5228 3000

Julie - Please check these deals for the correct contract/terms.  Also, 
please look into Heatherlock.  Vance is noming gas for this deal.  However, 
the deal ticket does not have an evergreen flag. When I tried to roll another 
month, I got a message that another contract was needed.

Thanks.

Fred,

Now that Daren has the purchase in, I have added August to the Deal Ticket  
386540 which is the Desk to Desk at the meter (4584 on Humble P/L, pathed as 
a Buy/Sell), and to Deal Ticket 386269 which is the Transport Usage ticket 
(from 4584 to meter 12 at the plant inlet, pathed on Humble contract 401).  
Please set up the appropriate track id's.  Since this is OffSystem, that 
should take care of the August issue.

Mary

Bob, 

Go ahead and accept the nom revision.  I believe that this is with PGE, not 
El Paso.  How do the rest of our noms compare with EOG?  I f they have a 
higher volume at another meter than we do, I would like to increase our nom 
there.  In effect, I want to keep our physical index position as close as 
possible to what we have in the system now.

Daren,

Charlotte Hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5,733 with El 
Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their 
nomination as follows:

C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.

Robert,

HPLC entered into a gas purchase agreement with the BJD-ESS Corporation 
(global #96036946) effective 4/1/2000 thru 3/31/2002.  The meter produced an 
average of 19mmbtu/d for the month of April, 2000.  A deal ticket should be 
created and entered into sitara based upon the following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price   Period

BJD-ESS Corporation   6563   19mmbtu/d   85% IF/HSC  4/2/00 - 4/30/00

Give me a call if there are any questions or concerns.

Thanks,

Subject: Resolved Issue: Re: Meter # 0986563 -  

FYI - 

It apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12/99 - 
04/02/00, were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase.  
Therefore, Vance explained to me that the volume of 1,517 Dth for the period 
should have been allocated to the Strangers agreement, just as it was.   Any 
deliveries were unauthorized (UDOG) and the gas then belongs to HPL.  Please 
give Vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue.

Thank you all for your patience and assistance.  I appreciate it!

Mary Jane

Bob,

The EOG contract stipulates that a Gas daily price should be paid only for 
the initial delivery of gas at the execution of gas purchase contract; any 
deliveries subsequent to the initial turn-on should be priced at first of

some of the wells.  Effective June 14, 2000, please increase the June 1
estimate from 2,300 mmbtu/d to 8,000 mmbtu/d @ HPL Meter 68-6296 delivery

4,600 mmbtu/d to 8,200 mmbtu/d.

Please call me at (713) 651-6858 with any questions.   Thanks!!!

After talking to both Vance  Taylor and Julie Meyers, only 5 of the 13 deals 
are committed reserve deals.  If they are not committed reserve they're not 
in the IM wellhead portfolio.  The plan if everyone agrees, is to go ahead 
and move the 5 and re-path to them to the  gathering and leave the other 13 
on the 215 contract. Here is a list of the ones to move  and leave.

Bob,

As mentioned earlier, Houston Exploration is also delivering gas to us at 
this meter.  The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be 
created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period 
Houston Exploration  9696   8000mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.16  2/1 - 2/28

FYI, I will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket if and when 
the gas buyer terms the deal up.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal 
and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the 
gathering contract.

Thanks,

Daren,

I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

Daren , I think I may have lost my mind ( no comment Vance) but did I talk to 
you about meter 6789 taking that volume from 12079 to 1200.  Also Yates has 
averaged around the 3366 that they want to bring the volume down to. Let me 
know what you think.  Husker TOM.

 Deal 138049 is committed reserve long term gas totaling 1,350mm per day 
which is a good deal.
 
 However, deal #:  348446 is a  duplicate deal which was overstated and 
should be zeroed out {bad deal}.
 
 This is Vance response to an inquiry made by Bob.
 
 Daren, do you want me to zero out  deal #: 348446 ?

Daren,

I tried to get KCS to give me the nom earlier but it is just now coming in.  
The nom on Vance's spreadsheet was 7,129.  KCS is reducing the gathering 
piece to 5,500.

Subject: HPL Meter #981488 PARIS TENASKA HPL

During the period of 12/1/99 through 12/3/99, the above meter has recorded 
flow on the following days:

 Days    Mmbtus

 12/1/99              173
 12/3/99                39

               106


Deal #124400 was at this meter during November 1999, but it expired on 
11/30/99.  Currently, these volumes are being booked under the HPL Strangers 
Gas Contract.  Logistics needs either (1) Deal #124400 extended, (2) new 
deal, or (3) approval to write-off these volumes to Unaccounted for Gas.  
(Please print, sign, and return original to Clem Cernosek).

Per our various discussions, I am sending an email to reiterate the 
disposition of volumes at Meter 9862, the Lehman Spinaker pay meter.  At this 
time, the General Land Office is transporting their share of production 
(21.8945%  interest) and HPL is purchasing the remaining 78.1055%.  

The GLO has nominated a transport volume at meter 9848, effective September 
1, 2000.  During this time, some test gas flowed.  I have had the HPL 
purchase back-dated to coincide with the transport nomination, and have had 
both deals moved to 9862.  The meter should probably be designated a 
Callout/Swing so that the proper equity percentages can be allocated after 
the production month by Volume Management.

For October production forward, I am going to re-rank/confirm the pay meter 
to ensure that the GLO receives a volume which should be close to their 
percentage after actuals close for the month.  This should alleviate any 
large balance swings on their agreement.

Anita:  For September, I need an accounting arrangement on deal ticket 
379424; HPL gathering agmt. at meter 9862.  Please unallocate the transport 
and purchase at 9848.  The meter is a daily swing right now.  Let me know 
when you are ready and I will change the allocation methodology.

I apologize for the length of this email, I want to make sure that we are all 
on the same page, to the extent that we need to be, prior to this deal 
getting too far down the road.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have 
any questions, comments, concerns, etc.  I am at extension 35251.

Thank you all for your time and patience,

Mary

Tom,

The Thamm #1 well came on line for first delivery on Tuesday, 2/1/00 at 
6:45pm.  The contract calls for first of the month pricing.  Please create a 
one month baseload firm deal ticket in sitara based upon the following:


Counterparty    Meter    Volume   Price

Union Gas Corporation   9823    500mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less $0.10



Susan will create a firm ticket for the term of the deal once our geologists 
have gathered enough data to forecast the reserves for this well; at such 
time, we will request that this ticket be zeroed out.

If there are any questions or concerns please give me a call.

Thanks,

vlt

Daren,

As you know, we have experienced some fluctuations at the Berryman well for 
OCT, which in turn affects our volumes at the Gulf Plains Plant.  From a 
physical standpoint, I think that we are fairly well balanced.  My concern is 
that we are "overproduced" on paper by 76,162 Dth/Mo.   I think that we need 
to bring the nominations up to balance in Sitara at the Berryman well and, a 
corresponding volume at Meters 708 and 6363, with an offset on Strangers to 
keep the physical side in line.  If my understanding is correct (and if not, 
please correct me) this should have a positive impact on our current month 
UA4.

Thank you,

Mary

Julie, 

I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into 
Jan 2000.

Cokinos / 9676  95912 - No this is a GTC Firm contract, deal expires with 
contract
Cokinos / 6373  128952 - This is a GTC Spot
Coral / 4120  93883 - This is on a Single Transaction contract, we would need 
to check with the trader
Encina / 6392  93487 - Yes, this is a committed reserve.  I marked the 
evergreen flag.
Midcoast / 5097  92956 - No, GTC 1st Purchaser, deal expires with contract.
United O&M / 5053 93728 - No, this deal was moved to the Wellhead portfolio 
for January, but the deal was terminated per legal.
Vintage / 2540  93750 - Not the right deal number.

Thanks.

Daren,

HPLC is purchasing gas from the following list of producers.   This 
production is currently being purchased on a spot basis and deal tickets 
should be entered into sitara for the follow:

Counterparty    Meter   MMBTu/d    Price
 
Engage Energy US, LP   5839   600     100% less $0.18
Engage Energy US, LP   5848   500     100% less $0.18

Gasper Rice Resources, Ltd.  9810   1     100% less $0.11

Swift Energy    2630   20     90%   less $0.258
Whiting Petroleum   6523   500     ???


Additionally, I asked Carlos to search sitara for what would be essentially 
be a spot ticket for the incremental volumes delivered to meter 9610 (Cage 
Ranch) for the production month of November.  I've received executed paper 
from Coastal documenting a purchase price of 100% of Gas Daily less a GPM 
sliding scale.  Please confirm whether or not a sitara ticket has been 
generated.  If not, please use this e-mail as a request to do so.

Thanks,

Daren,

Silver in Gas Control called me and said the flow at meter # 9833 was approx. 
5,400/d for June.  The nom is 13,171/d.  Do you want me to adjust June?  The 
nom for July is 5,398/d.  Vance listed 11,068/d on the preliminary July 
spreadsheet but he called me and revised it to 5,398/d.  The C/P is Helmerich 
& Payne.

I left Vance a voice mail message yesterday but he was out sick.  He called 
me back and said there shouldn't be any flow at meter 9707 and there wasn't a 
deal in place with United Oil & Minerals.

I rolled this deal for day one in October only.  

Bob - Please check with Vance on this deal.  Has it terminated or should it 
roll for October.  I don't think that Vance nom'd anything.

David here is the other side of the coin.  These are meters that are not in 
the wellhead  portfolio  for May  but are on vances sheet.  Several of them 
are new meters and some were just not nomed in April.  Vance can you confirm 
that these are right for the Well head. Thanks

she recieves a reserve study.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal 
and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the 
gathering contract.


Thanks,

The above meter is currently doing 13.0 on a 26.0 nom.

Please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution.

Daren,

KCS wants to take their nom down from 6,500 to 5,700 on the gathering and increase the Texaco transport by the same volume at meter # 9658 beginning today.  Are you okay with the change?

Bob

Sorry about the confusion on the dates between the subject line (correctly

Daren,  Shore line would like to take meter 9781 from 460 to 1  for the 11 th 
gas day.  It flowed the nom for April so they must be having well problems 
this month.  Meter 9680 has a change from 739 to 1200.  It flowed in the 700 
for April .  Could be new production coming on behind the meter. 

Texaco would like to change meter 9826 from 1201 to 1500 for the rest of the 
month.  In April they flowed from 1000 to 1300.

Julie,

The Camden and North Central contracts are new packages of gas that have yet 
to come on-line.  Once production commences, I will request that a spot deal 
be put in place.

Bob,

Please create and enter into sitara a ticket based on the following 
information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price    Period

Heatherloch Municipal Utility District 6879   500mmbtu/d   100% IF/HSC less 
$0.12  10/1 - 10/31

Julie, please confirm.

The Heatherlock deal had a Single Transaction Agreement attached to it.  When 
the contract ended the deal ended.

The other two I believe we just need a email from Vance or Donald setting up 
a spot ticket.

Vance could you look into that?   Do I have the wrong contract attached?  Or 
is there a new contract.  for Camden & North Central, are those just going to 
be spot tickets?

Team,

We are still waiting on the Agreements to be returned to us for the Camden 
Driscoll Ranch #3 Well.  We should receive them by Monday, December 4, 2000.  
I spoke with the field guy today (Bobby Husky) and he stated that the well 
would not be ready to turn on until 3 weeks from now.  He said that an amine 
plant is being installed.  Therefore, we are waiting on them.  This is just 
an FYI to everyone.    This will still be booked for December 2000.  Please 
forward this email to anyone that I might have left out.

Thank you!

Daren,

According to Vance's response to Lauri's email, the nominations should be revised upwards approximately 650/d on the gathering contract(s) at this meter.  There is currently nominations of 1,353/d (1,153 gathering and 200 transport).  The flow should be around 2,000/d.  Is it alright to include the increase of 650/d with the other revisions to be made after trading on Friday?

Bob

Lauri,

Effective 3/1/2001, HPLC amended its contract with Royal Production changing the price to 100% HSC less $0.16 and extending the term through 2/28/02. Consequently, for March, HPLC should be purhasing volumes from two wells at meter 5310.  Effective April, HPLC amended the same contract releasing the L.G. Talbert #2 lease in the committed reserves agreement; Mike Morris is the gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000mmbtu/d.  For April I nom 1132/d; Bob, we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental production at this point.

Thanks,

Louis Cox with Copano (the interconnecting party at this meter) informed me that effective March 1st, we should have been buying incremental gas from Royal Production at this point since they were no longer selling it to Copano.  There have been no changes in the producer services noms at this point, however.  This point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow I have access to shows noms of 1332mm with BAV of 3497mm on March 18th.  Bob/Vance- could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should be?  Copano says they're not getting the gas in April either, but they do not know how long HPLC is purchasing the incremental gas from Royal.  Please let me know what the resolution is.  Thanks.

Daren,

This deal began in May, 2000.  I don't have a deal to book to from 12/99  - 
04/00.  Could you please retro the deal, or please tell me whom I need to 
speak to to clear this matter up?  Thank you for your time and patience

Pat, 

This is the Texaco Fee CP, it flowed a total of 1,517 from Dec 99 to Apr 2 
2000.  There is a Strangers Agmt. set up to take allocations, however, this 
must be a wellhead related pt. that has declined.  How do I go about finding 
out who this belongs to?  I thought about ringing Texaco, but, wanted to 
check before I made any calls.

Stephanie, you are correct.  There's no deal set up for this meter from 12/99 
thru 4/2000.

Mary, please take a look at the meter for the months in question and let 
Stephanie or myself know whose gas this belongs to.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Anita, 
If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the 
correct person.

For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for 
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume 
management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the 
volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know.  

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )

Bob,

The transport rates established for the meters subject to the 6/1/96 Gas Gathering Agreement between Gulf Coast Pipeline Company and Houston Pipe Line Company (96008709) were for staggered periods of time - thus the rate established for 6677 ended on 2/28/2001, the rate established for 4555 and 9618 ended on 4/30/2001 and there was no rate established for 9889 due to its recent set up.  The rates for the period subsequent to the end dates for the first three meters are set forth below; the rate for 9889 was agreed to by the parties for May only.  Please make sure that the proper transport rate is attached to each sitara deal as follows:

	meter 6677	sitara 166026	Lynx Energy Company, Inc.		$0.20 for March, $0.65 for April and May
	
	meter 4555	sitara 139067	Danex Energy Company		$0.65 for May

	meter 9618	sitara 138233	Gulf Coast Pipeline Company		$0.65 for May

	meter 9889	sitara 752482	D & P Operating Company		$0.65 for May

The 6/1/96 Gas Gathering Agreement has been terminated effective 5/31/01 and will be replaced by an Agreement dated 6/1/01 between Gulf Coast Pipeline Partners, L.P. and Houston Pipe Line Company.

George,
I informed you incorrectley on the transport rates on Gulf Coast for March, April, & May.
This is how it should be: 
                                                  Meter 6677
                                                                     March rate $.20
                                                                     April rate    $.65
                                                                     May rate    $.65
                                                  Meter 4555
                                                                     May rate     $.65
                                                  Meter 9618
                                                                    May rate    $.65

We need to amend the current Gulf Coast contract to reflect these changes. I told Tom Cones
we would have this amendment to him the first of next week.

Bob,

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from Barrett Resources, Ocean Energy and Seneca Resources?  They were on George's spreadsheet but they are not termed up.  The only deals termed up are Mariner, St. Mary Land, Walter Oil & Gas and The Meridian Resource.

Vance,

Deal tickets have been created and entered in Sitara as noted below.  Deal # 652448 was entered by Risk as a term purchase at a price of IFHSC less $0.14.  You have indicated the price to be Gas Daily less $0.14.  Which price is correct?

Bob

Shoreline has sent a revision to trim down the 6722 meter from 570 to 428.   
Daren I can't  tell you what it flowed last month  due to more than one 
person is at that meter.  We only have 30 nominated there now.  Let me know 
what you think.  Thanks.

Mary Jo,

Thanks for the update.  Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days
prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior
to selected month,  does that mean we need to give you notice for December
by Tuesday, November 21st at 5:00 PM or Monday, November 20th at 5:00 PM
assuming the 23rd and 24th are holidays?

Vance,

It appears the actual volumes have been significantly higher than nominations 
at the subject meter the past several months.  The following represents 
activity during the months of June through September:

Gas Month Total Nom MMBtu Total Actual MMBtu

06/2000  19,680   116,040
07/2000  19,933   128,755
08/2000  19,530   136,845
09/2000  18,540   159,935

Deal # 135708, Calpine Natural Gas Company, is the only activity at this 
meter.  Should we adjust the nomination to more closely resemble the actual 
volume?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob

7 Sis is averaging 23,000 M/Day.  Big Cowboy is pretty dead on.  Carol would 
like for us to gross up for Saxet based on the number of flow days left so 
that the nomination to the plant takes the payback into account.

Who is considered to be on Greg Sharp's orig team?  If they have deals in the 
Wellhead Portfolio, do we need to move them out?  Just double checking.

Great.  Keep in mind - some people continue to confuse "Wellhead Portfolio" 
with "deals done by Producer Services."  All that should be in the wellhead 
portfolio is truly wellhead deals - not deals done by Greg Sharp's 
origination teams at competitive points.  Does that make sense?

I worked with Tom Acton last night to get the Wellhead Portfolio cleaned up.  
Tom had a sheet from Vance that we used to determine what deals should be in 
the portfolio.  I believe the portfolio is now correct.  The Sitara team will 
move the deals we identified today.  

Dave

Vance:

Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal, 
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.

Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts 
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.  
Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads 
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will 
probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.

Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells 
behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal 
to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another 
deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced 
contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result 
in a financial loss).  

In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow 
at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon 
as I ascertain that date.

In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals 
which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that 
they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing 
level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish 
this.

Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area, 


Mary

Meters 4555, 6677, 9618 & 9889

Bob,

The transport rates established for the meters subject to the 6/1/96 Gas Gathering Agreement between Gulf Coast Pipeline Company and Houston Pipe Line Company (96008709) were for staggered periods of time - thus the rate established for 6677 ended on 2/28/2001, the rate established for 4555 and 9618 ended on 4/30/2001 and there was no rate established for 9889 due to its recent set up.  The rates for the period subsequent to the end dates for the first three meters are set forth below; the rate for 9889 was agreed to by the parties for May only.  Please make sure that the proper transport rate is attached to each sitara deal as follows:

	meter 6677	sitara 166026	Lynx Energy Company, Inc.		$0.20 for March, $0.65 for April and May
	
	meter 4555	sitara 139067	Danex Energy Company		$0.65 for May

	meter 9618	sitara 138233	Gulf Coast Pipeline Company		$0.65 for May

	meter 9889	sitara 752482	D & P Operating Company		$0.65 for May

The 6/1/96 Gas Gathering Agreement has been terminated effective 5/31/01 and will be replaced by an Agreement dated 6/1/01 between Gulf Coast Pipeline Partners, L.P. and Houston Pipe Line Company.

George,
I informed you incorrectley on the transport rates on Gulf Coast for March, April, & May.
This is how it should be: 
                                                  Meter 6677
                                                                     March rate $.20
                                                                     April rate    $.65
                                                                     May rate    $.65
                                                  Meter 4555
                                                                     May rate     $.65
                                                  Meter 9618
                                                                    May rate    $.65

We need to amend the current Gulf Coast contract to reflect these changes. I told Tom Cones
we would have this amendment to him the first of next week.

Darren:

 This is potential new volume for March , 2000:

 Counterparty  Meter   Volume   Mid Month Gas Daily?

 Cico Oil & Gas Co. TBA   2117 MMbtu per day Yes 


 This number is NOT in Vance's production estimate. This well is anticipated 
to come on the first week of March but earlier is possible.


 Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Daren, 

Per our phone conversation, please find the following information:

Camden Resources Inc., Driscoll Ranch #1, meter 9858, price:  HSC less $0.10
North Central Oil Corporation, McMurrey-Talbert #2, meter 5228, price:  HSC 
less $0.14
KCS, Dickenson, meter 9797 - Susan Smith will be preparing a formal ticket 
for the Buy and the Sell for the month of October.  We will be watching the 
gas specs on this package, and if all goes well, we will book the rest of the 
term at the end of October.

On a go forward basis, for gas that we provide in the monthly nomination that 
we know is not ticketed, can Vance just include the price in the comments 
field on each package to help you estimate for bid-week?  Let us know if this 
information will be helpful in the future.

Thank you, 
Melissa

Daran,  We have a few volume changes for the 1st of March,  first EOG has 
changed there volume for the gas at meter 6296 from 11,036 to 7100.  I  ran 
into Laurie Allen in the hall and she said we were heavy there and  that she 
would visit with you abut it.   The second one is Cokinos, they  will not 
confirm the volume at meter 9656.  We have 922 and they want that they want 
950.  I looked up there nom and that is what they asked for.  Not much of a 
change.  Last is the one that you faxed down to me this mornings.  Basin 
Exploration wants to drop there nom due to well problems from 896 to 1.  for 
the whole month.  Let me know what you think and I'LL get after it.  Tom Cat

Mary,

HPLC meter number 0984229 was physically remove from service in December, 
1999.   Typically, before HPL physically pulls a meter, production has ceased 
at minimum for 6 months or the production has been released.  In the case of 
the Roos common point, the producing wells were released and attached to 
meter 0989740 in 11/98 and the remaining wells are non-producing.  
Resultingly, the only viable option for resolution is option 2.  We should 
take the deal to zero by "unwinding" it.

Subject: Re: Meter 984229 - Roos Common Point - Trade Zone 18  

Vance:

Per our conversation, we have two possible options to resolve this deal, 
depending on whether the wellheads are producing or not.

Producing:  If that is the case, the purchase from Calpine, and any contracts 
hedged to it will need to be backed up in the system to a wellhead level.  
Once that is done, I will need to research in the system how those wellheads 
were allocated and paid and reallocate to your Calpine deal.  This will 
probably have to go back to HPLC's ownership of HPLR's gathering assets.

Non-producing:  Should we determine that the Common Point and any wells 
behind it have been shut-in, or P&A'd, we will need to reallocate this deal 
to zero, and unwind any hedges against it (or, move the hedges to another 
deal, if possible.  Since the deal is older, we probably sold lower priced 
contracts against the production and a buy-back today would possibly result 
in a financial loss).  

In either case, the deal needs to be cleaned up back to the date of last flow 
at meter 4229, which I am currently looking into.  I will email you as soon 
as I ascertain that date.

In lieu of the past couple of days, we may need to look at all of the deals 
which were impacted by HPLC's aquisition of HPLR's gathering to ensure that 
they are being captured properly, both at a book level and at a state filing 
level.  Please let me know what your thoughts are as to how to accomplish 
this.

Thank you again for all of your hard work in this area, 


Mary

estimate from 2,300 mmbtu/d to 8,000 mmbtu/d @ HPL Meter 68-6296 delivery
to HPL Thompsonville (PG7E Meter 834134).

Production from the M. Martinez leases has increased due to a new well
behind meter 98-6067.  The estimates from this meter has increased from
4,600 mmbtu/d to 8,200 mmbtu/d.

Thanks for the info Heidi.  It's always good to have a second pair of eyes 
with all these wells.  I have done some research and all but  one are HPLC 
deals and were not putting those on the gathering contract.  I'll run this by 
Daren and make the changes if needed.  Please let me know if you see anything 
else it just takes a minute to check on it.

Donald,

Back in October we had the gas received by HPL at the above meter moved to=
=20
Strangers Gas pending a call from Coastal to renegotiate a contract for Sep=
t=20
2000 gas.  Since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger=01,s gas it=
 has=20
been placed on an MJG deal which was the only valid deal available for Sept=
=20
2000.
I assume Coastal has not contacted Brian as of yet.  Is it possible to have=
 a=20
deal created for Coastal with a price of zero?  I know that we definitely d=
o=20
not want to pay MJG for this gas, but as long as the volume is sitting on=
=20
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the=
=20
payment out.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Nick

Nick,

I understand that they terminated their agreement.  However, I don't feel=
=20
that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for th=
e=20
gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter. =20
Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I=

would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call=20
them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to=20
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was=20
shut-in. =20

Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.

Mary

This is the estimated Dickinson nomination for the month of May 2001.  The
HPL nomination volume to be effective 5/1/2001 is:

			      600	MMBtu/day for KCS Resources (8/8ths)
	         _____
		      600	MMBtu/day Total (assumed Btu factor of 1.083
@ 14.65 dry)

If you need additional information, KCS' field contact is Stretch Brennan in
Victoria: 512 / 576 - 1005.  This is the transaction for which KCS has a
"buy/sell" in place with HPL; therefore, this "production point" nomination
needs to trigger an "mirrored" nomination at the redelivery point (currently
at Riverside).

Thanks, Bob.  It now turns out that due to operational issues, the additional 10,000/d may not come on next week.  Spinnaker is having problems dealing with all the condensate associated with this gas and may not have the proper equipment in place to allow the additional gas to flow and also handle the additional condensate associated with that gas.  I'll keep you posted.

George,

The Texas General Land Office transport volume is in POPS for May nominated at 4,800/d.  Deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from Texas General Land Office.  The transport volume of 4,800/d comprises approximately 22% of the total volume nominated at the meter.

N. Padre Is. Block 883L

Contract 96047295, Meter 098-9862 (098-9848 platform)

Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows:

	Spinnaker Exploration Company, L.L.C		sit 379424		5,886/d		27%
	Ranger Oil Company				sit 533410		5,886/d		27%
	The Houston Exploration Company		sit 535119		5,045/d		23%

It appears that the Texas General Land Office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for May - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume.  Texas GLO has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the N. Padre Is. Block 883L.   

Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.

Christy, I think there is a good chance that the information shown below
went to you, or your office.

I would like to get involved in finalizing plans for revenue distribution
for the N. Padre production.  I am certain you are way ahead of me on this
matter.  Spinnaker expects a Division Order Title Opining within a few
weeks.  I also expect the attorney to make some title requirements which
will delay a final Opinion.  In talking with Ranger and The Houston
Exploration Company, they are prepared to receive their gross (shown below)
and be responsible to their respective ORRI owners.

How do you recommend we proceed?  Will HPL pay taxes on behalf of the
parties?

When you get a minute, please call me at 713/759-1770.

Thanks,

Dan McCue

Daren,

Mike in Gas Control called and said meter # 9842 is flooded and has not flowed in a couple of days.  The field tech said it will probably be a few days before it resumes.  Do you want the nom adjusted?  It is at 8,034.  The deal # is 377169.

Could you give me the status or an ETA on this meter.  We are in the middle 
of a big push to lower our exposure and the following customer has $55,000 
not including Sept production because we've paid manually without having the 
volumes in Unify for this meter.

Thanks,

Bob,

The following production commenced to flow on Friday and a ticket should be 
created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period
ISS, L.L.C     9837   3,500mmbtu/d  100% Gas Daily  less $0.09 6/16 - 6/30


FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the 
remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of July.  Additionally, 
this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead 
portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,

Julie, 

I need to know if the following deals have evergreen provisions to roll into 
Jan 2000.

Cokinos / 9676  95912 - No this is a GTC Firm contract, deal expires with 
contract
Cokinos / 6373  128952 - This is a GTC Spot
Coral / 4120  93883 - This is on a Single Transaction contract, we would need 
to check with the trader
Encina / 6392  93487 - Yes, this is a committed reserve.  I marked the 
evergreen flag.
Midcoast / 5097  92956 - No, GTC 1st Purchaser, deal expires with contract.
United O&M / 5053 93728 - No, this deal was moved to the Wellhead portfolio 
for January, but the deal was terminated per legal.
Vintage / 2540  93750 - Not the right deal number.

Thanks.

Mary,

HPLC currently has a gas purchase agreement (global #96014987) in place with 
Calpine that extends through 5/31/2001.  Sitara deal no. 133259 correctly has 
this contract attached to it.  Effective 11/1/1998 the contract was amended 
releasing Gouger wells no. 5 & 6.  These wells were apparently the only 
producing wells behind this point.  Evidence being no measured volumes in 
MIPS.  There are however other non producing wells behind this point.  Is 
your Sept & Oct UA4 issue the direct result of volumes being scheduled at 
meter no. 4229?  If so, for November, the nom at this point will be taken to 
1mmbtu/d until the wells behind this point began to produce.

As far as meter 6835 (Roos #1 C/P) is concerned, HPLC also has a contract 
(#96003771) in place with Cokinos Nat Gas that is currently in an "evergreen" 
status.  The aforementioned wells were released from the Calpine contract; 
however, they were not added behind meter 6835.  Therefore, I do not agree 
that the deal (133259) should be edited to change the meter.

Hopefully this information is useful!

I am not sure who should handle this, so, I shared the "wealth".  On deal 
ticket 133259, purchase from Calpine, the deal is input at meter 4229, which, 
per the email below, was terminated.  I have an unresolvable UA4 issue at 
meter 4229 for September and for October.  I have changed the meter 
designation for November forward, however, I receive an error in Sitara when 
I attempt to change either the prior or current month.  This deal should have 
been changed to meter 6835 effective back in February of this year.  Please 
let me know what I can do to resolve this issue ASAP. 

Thanks,

Mary

Cheryl,

FYI  - Here is the message from Mary Poorman in Logistics.  

Mary,

Cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be 
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas 
flow on the meter.

Thanks,

Kathy and I are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above 
referenced meter.  The system (Pops) does not show a BAV flow or an actual 
flow for prior months.  Kathy phoned measurement to inquire about Mips 
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to 
February, 2000.  I am showing a purchase from Calpine at this meter (deal 
ticket 133259) on gathering agreement 

I would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of 
this meter and this deal.  Please forward any information you may have.

Thank you for your time and patience,

Mary

Daren, EOG  called and said that the well behind 986296 which has been down 
for a week from 7100 to 4400 for the last week or so needs to stay at the 
4400  for the rest of the month.  I  changed the ticket for that.  This was 
per Suzanne Saldivar.  Also Shoreline reduced the meter 6722 from 30 to 24.  
also changed that. last Cody went from 7666 to 7600 at meter 6722.  Both 
Shoreline and Cody were per customer request.

I'm still concern about April's nom; if we don't take it to zero, than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to Barrett's April deal.  This would be incorrect.

Bob,

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Vance,

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from Barrett Resources, Ocean Energy and Seneca Resources?  They were on George's spreadsheet but they are not termed up.  The only deals termed up are Mariner, St. Mary Land, Walter Oil & Gas and The Meridian Resource.

Robert,

HPLC entered into a gas purchase agreement with the BJD-ESS Corporation 
(global #96036946) effective 4/1/2000 thru 3/31/2002.  The meter produced an 
average of 19mmbtu/d for the month of April, 2000.  A deal ticket should be 
created and entered into sitara based upon the following information:

Counterparty    Meter   Volume   Price   Period

BJD-ESS Corporation   6563   19mmbtu/d   85% IF/HSC  4/2/00 - 4/30/00

FYI - 

It apppears that any deliveries made during the time frame from 12/99 - 
04/02/00, were made without any contractual arrangements for purchase.  
Therefore, Vance explained to me that the volume of 1,517 Dth for the period 
should have been allocated to the Strangers agreement, just as it was.   Any 
deliveries were unauthorized (UDOG) and the gas then belongs to HPL.  Please 
give Vance a call if you have any further questions regarding this issue.

Thank you all for your patience and assistance.  I appreciate it!

Mary Jane

Vance,

Thank you for the information.  That explains the deal.  What we need now, to 
correctly book these volumes and clear any current issues in Volume 
Management and/or settlements which would date back to the inception of the 
deal.  This will also ensure that your book is correct for this deal.  I 
think that Bob Cotten is the one to correct/add the deal, and then Tom Acton 
and myself will need to make requests of Volume Mgmt. to kick-off the 
re-booking process.

Thank you for your time,

Mary

Mary Jo,

Thanks for the update.  Regarding the notice provision of 6 business days
prior to the close of business on the last business day of the month prior
to selected month,  does that mean we need to give you notice for December
by Tuesday, November 21st at 5:00 PM or Monday, November 20th at 5:00 PM
assuming the 23rd and 24th are holidays?

Bob:

We have just been advised by EPGT (El Paso) that they will be processing
the  S.G. Marshall gas April 2001; therefore, EOGR will have to reduce the
volume that will be available for sale to HPL.  The new estimate is 3,400
mmbtu/day.

Thanks.

Fred:

I have run this issue by Clem Cernosek for further research, and expect to 
have his answer this afternoon.  In the meantime, it is my understanding that 
this well is behind the Big Cowboy system.  At this time, we have deal ticket 
380710, purchase from CCGM, L.P. on HPLC/HPLC.   This deal should probably be 
on Gulf Energy/BigCowboy.  The producer, as I understand it, is Acock 
Production, however, I may be mis-informed.  Any insight which any of you can 
shed on this deal would be very welcome, I would like to capture this 
accurately and definitively as early on as possible, so as to prevent any 
future issues.

Thank you all for your patience and assistance,

Mary

The above meter is currently doing 13.0 on a 26.0 nom.

Please take a look and see if nom adjustments might be a solution.

Looking @ deal #109670, the terms indicates that HPLC buys 2.5% of Saxet 
volumes.  Should I assume that I should take the total flow amount (per day 
for this deal ticket) and adjust the expected volumes to reflect a nom that 
is 2% of the daily flow versus the "1" that is currently nomed?

H -  E  -  L  -  P!!!

FYI - 

We are having some "after-the-fact" balancing issues with King Ranch.  I just 
spoke with Carol regarding our net position with the plant, she has informed 
me that the Saxet Canales production we are buying at the inlet has been 
averaging approximately 3,850 Dth/day for January, and has been producing at 
or around that level since November.  We don't have eyes at the meter, 
however, Carol was brought online this past week, and I will be receiving 
production information on a regular basis to balance redeliveries.

We have been scheduling 838 to 1,045 Dth/day at the meter.  We need to gross 
up for Jan in order to ensure that we capture our volumes correctly and do 
not create additional balancing issues with the plant.

Please let me know if you have any further questions, or need additional 
information.

Mary

Daren,

According to Vance's response to Lauri's email, the nominations should be 
revised upwards approximately 650/d on the gathering contract(s) at this 
meter.  There is currently nominations of 1,353/d (1,153 gathering and 200 
transport).  The flow should be around 2,000/d.  Is it alright to include the 
increase of 650/d with the other revisions to be made after trading on Friday?

Lauri,

Effective 3/1/2001, HPLC amended its contract with Royal Production changing 
the price to 100% HSC less $0.16 and extending the term through 2/28/02. 
Consequently, for March, HPLC should be purhasing volumes from two wells at 
meter 5310.  Effective April, HPLC amended the same contract releasing the 
L.G. Talbert #2 lease in the committed reserves agreement; Mike Morris is the 
gas buyer and expects volumes of approximately 2000mmbtu/d.  For April I nom 
1132/d; Bob, we should probably increase the nom to reflect the incremental 
production at this point.

Thanks,

Louis Cox with Copano (the interconnecting party at this meter) informed me 
that effective March 1st, we should have been buying incremental gas from 
Royal Production at this point since they were no longer selling it to 
Copano.  There have been no changes in the producer services noms at this 
point, however.  This point appears to be on a 14 day chart and the last flow 
I have access to shows noms of 1332mm with BAV of 3497mm on March 18th.  
Bob/Vance- could one of you guys check into this and see what the nom should 
be?  Copano says they're not getting the gas in April either, but they do not 
know how long HPLC is purchasing the incremental gas from Royal.  Please let 
me know what the resolution is.  Thanks.

Stacy,  Bill Moore from Texaco called and the well at meter 9826 which came 
on at the beginning of the month at 2,000 a day  has dropped of to 1,200 a 
day.   Bill would like to change the nom to 900 so we balance for the month.  
Let me know what you think and I'll get back with him.

Daren,

I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think the 
gas will flow for the month and at what price.  I will use your decision for 
our bidweek postion.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

Per our recent discussions, please evaluate the above gas stream for 
reconnection into HPL.  This gas is presently being produced into Dow 
Pipeline.  An existing, three-inch meter tube is in place, and the gas can be 
switched by opening and closing existing valves?  A copy of a recent gas 
analysis has been provided.  The expected gas flow is 9000 to 10,000 MCF/D.  
Mr. Matt Johnson with Wagner & Brown has this gas committed on a month to 
month basis into Dow.  Start-up of April 1 is anticipated.  Mr. Johnson is 
expecting lower pipeline pressures; hence, enhanced production.  I would 
attempt to obtain at least a year's commitment of this gas from Wagner & 
Brown.  Mr. Johnson did not want to flow this gas for March since the 
three-inch run could not handle the total volume, and he did not want to 
split the flow.  Operational logistics were also questionable (compression, 
etc.).  If you need further info, please advise.  Thanks.  JAB

Cerrito Lastiendas - has meter flow on the 7th and the deal ended on the 6th.  Can we extend the deal for the 48 mmbtu's that flowed
or can I override the meter and add it to a day that flowed less than the nom? The third had 4861 and the nom was for 5000.
Thanks - Julie

Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows:

	Spinnaker Exploration Company, L.L.C		sit 379424		5,886/d		27%
	Ranger Oil Company				sit 533410		5,886/d		27%
	The Houston Exploration Company		sit 535119		5,045/d		23%

It appears that the Texas General Land Office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for May - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume.  Texas GLO has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the N. Padre Is. Block 883L.   

Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.

I'm still concern about April's nom; if we don't take it to zero, than we could have the possibility of the allocations group adding volumes to Barrett's April deal.  This would be incorrect.

Bob,

HPLC continues to purchase gas from both Ocean and Seneca on a term basis; firm tickets were submitted for April origination beginning with the month of April.  As for as  Barrett, they are selling their gas under a JOA with Seneca; therefore, 100% of Barrett's production is being paid to Seneca.  Consequently, you should see tickets in sitara for both counterparties.

Let me know is you can't.

Are we still purchasing gas at meter 435 from Barrett Resources, Ocean Energy and Seneca Resources?  They were on George's spreadsheet but they are not termed up.  The only deals termed up are Mariner, St. Mary Land, Walter Oil & Gas and The Meridian Resource.

Shoreline wants to increase the volume at  meter 9830 for the 10th gas day.  
This is a new meter so there is not much history to it.  They want to go from 
535 to 750.  last month it flowed in the upper 500's  but it didn't come on 
till the 21st of the month.

Yes, but I would request that Julie not send out paper since this should be 
back signed shortly.  I noticed the deal Vance requested below (which Tom set 
up as deal 211573) is attached to a committed reserves agreement that does 
not cover this meter.

Daren,

KCS wants to take their nom down from 6,500 to 5,700 on the gathering and 
increase the Texaco transport by the same volume at meter # 9658 beginning 
today.  Are you okay with the change?

Sorry about the confusion on the dates between the subject line (correctly

for the "shift" between Texaco and KCS should be March 28, 2001.

Lauri,

HPL's Gas Control could not provide any information.  I called Bob Withers 
with KCS and he was in agreement to reduce the nom from 894 to 345/ day.  The 
changes will be effective 1/11/01 as follows:

Meter #  Deal #

9797   439825
3543   439837

Subject: KCS Buy/Sell

In light of December's allocation of actual volumes at KCS #9797, it looks as 
though we need to reduce the nom at both this meter and at Tejas Riverside, 
#3543, where the "sell" portion of this buy/sell occurs for the remainder of 
January.  December actual receipts at #9797 were 15,889mm or an average of 
513mm/day.  The January nomination is 864mm/day.  I think it needs to be 
reduced to approx 345mm/day effective 1/11 or there may be a large diffence 
between what we buy at the wellhead and what is delivered back to KCS at 
Tejas Riverside.  Any info you could get from gas control or KCS about actual 
flow current month would help nail this nomination down.  Thanks.

Daren,

Mike in Gas Control called and said meter # 9842 is flooded and has not 
flowed in a couple of days.  The field tech said it will probably be a few 
days before it resumes.  Do you want the nom adjusted?  It is at 8,034.  The 
deal # is 377169.

Yes, until further notice.  We will change the nom to match flow in order to 
keep the meter as balanced as possible.  Otherwise, it stays the same.  So 
far, the meters are flowing real close to noms.

Bob:

We have just been advised by EPGT (El Paso) that they will be processing
the  S.G. Marshall gas April 2001; therefore, EOGR will have to reduce the
volume that will be available for sale to HPL.  The new estimate is 3,400
mmbtu/day.

Thanks.

One more request....

The Ken Petroleum contract:  96019316 will terminate tonight (2/29/00)!  I 
believe that also means that the deal attached to this contract will 
terminate.  It covers meter 6834.

Tom, can you put in the following one month ticket:
Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price   
Ken Petroleum Corporation 6834   89mmbtu  IF/HSC less $0.41 

Julie, can you confirm via a GTC Spot, per George's request. 

Thank you for handling on such short notice.

Subject: Spinnaker - Supply Verification 11958SU - October 2000 production

Gary,

When Spinnaker got paid, the volumes inadvertently got averaged over the 
month. Since Spinnaker was paid Gas
Daily pricing for the month, there is going to be a dollar discrepancy when 
the volumes are re-sent over on the actual
day of flow.  In my calculations (using Gas Daily less $.21 as the price) we 
are going to owe Spinnaker an additional
$ 220,398.57.

One issue that needs to be addressed is this:  should the additional money go 
directly to Spinnaker since they are allocating
out October 2000 production payments to Ranger and Houston Exploration?  

Attached is a spreadsheet showing where I came up with the extra money owed:



Thank you all!!

Christy
39050

PS This does not address the issue between the onshore and offshore meter, 
this is just addressing the redistribution
of volumes for the month of October.

Mary,

HPLC executed a gas purchase agreement with CCGM, LP effective 7/1/2000.  
HPLC secured the purchase of production from the Briscoe #1 well in Webb 
county for 12 months; the producer of this well is Hoover Oil & Gas, Inc.  A 
tap and meter for this production was set on the Big Cowboy system and this 
gas now flows to the Exxon King Ranch plant.

I agree that this gas should be scheduled on Big Cowboy (GEPL) and not HPLC.  
I erroneously nominated this gas on HPLC for the month of October; however, 
did not do so for the month of November.

Hopefully this is useful information!

Fred:

I have run this issue by Clem Cernosek for further research, and expect to 
have his answer this afternoon.  In the meantime, it is my understanding that 
this well is behind the Big Cowboy system.  At this time, we have deal ticket 
380710, purchase from CCGM, L.P. on HPLC/HPLC.   This deal should probably be 
on Gulf Energy/BigCowboy.  The producer, as I understand it, is Acock 
Production, however, I may be mis-informed.  Any insight which any of you can 
shed on this deal would be very welcome, I would like to capture this 
accurately and definitively as early on as possible, so as to prevent any 
future issues.

Thank you all for your patience and assistance,

Mary

George,

The Texas General Land Office transport volume is in POPS for May nominated at 4,800/d.  Deal # 535132 was initially set up as a wellhead purchase from Texas General Land Office.  The transport volume of 4,800/d comprises approximately 22% of the total volume nominated at the meter.

N. Padre Is. Block 883L

Contract 96047295, Meter 098-9862 (098-9848 platform)

Bob, we currently have a total of 16.817 Mmbtu/d nominated for purchases at meter 098-9862 as follows:

	Spinnaker Exploration Company, L.L.C		sit 379424		5,886/d		27%
	Ranger Oil Company				sit 533410		5,886/d		27%
	The Houston Exploration Company		sit 535119		5,045/d		23%

It appears that the Texas General Land Office transport volume is not properly included in sitara for May - see deal 535132, which shows 0 as the expectted volume.  Texas GLO has historically transported about 23% of the gas at the N. Padre Is. Block 883L.   

Once it starts flowing, the incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d should be allocated to the deals mentioned above based on the proportions shown above.

Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated 
during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it 
is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for 
this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Vance,

The following deal is not on you spreadsheet nor is it on the prebid list 
that Daren maintains:

137595  Dewbre Petr.  9662

Is this a good deal?

Bob

Can you increase the sales/nominations at the referenced meter by 500
mmbtu/d effective May 21?  Have learned that El Paso (PG&E) is not
deducting fuel effective May 2001; this increases the volume EOG Resources
has available for sale.  Please contact me with any questions or concerns.
Thanks!

Karen,

It has been determined that the only valid deal is a wellhead purchase from 
Texlan at meter # 6788 in 11/00 and 12/00 production.  Please reallocate the 
meter to give all volume to Texlan.  Thanks.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

The attachment provides details for a final total wellhead nomination for June 2001 of 727.856 Mmbtu/d.  Of significance, we have reduced the North Central nomination at meter 6633 from 25,000 Mmbtu/d to 14,000 Mmbtu/d.  Also, the 727,856 Mmbtu/d includes an approximate incremental 10,000 Mmbtu/d (from 22,121 Mmbtu/d to 31,591 Mmbtu/d) volume at the Spinnaker meter (9862) which is not yet flowing, but is expected to flow by the first of the month.

Changes from the nomination submitted to you on 5/24/2001 are noted in Column F of the spreadsheet.

George,

The following are my answers to your questions:

1.  No.

2.  The nomination is at the pay meter 9862.

3.  In the past, this purchase has not been listed on the spreadsheet.  It has been 	      maintained by the Risk group.

4.  As of 4/24/01, Comstock's nomination is 43,681 and Kerr McGee's is 29,037.

5.  This purchase is not listed on the spreadsheet.  It is maintained separately on a file by Daren.  To the best of my knowledge it is a good wellhead purchase.

Bob

Subject:	May 2001 Nomination

Bob,

Questions based on the information in the Facilitation by Location Report:

1.  Meter 9643 HGPL/HPL - Stratton, Tejones Operating Corporation, sitara 266970:  Should this purchase be at meter 9638, FREEMAN PROD-MAXINE FIELD in Trade Zone 18?

2.  I presume we are not counting BOTH Meter 9848 NORTH PADRE ISLAND BLK8 and Meter 9862 LEHMAN/SPINNAKER ONSHORE.  Isn't this the same gas?

3. Meter 3536 SEAHAWK/A-S (MAT PLT 520), EOG Resources, sitara 725391:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

4.  Meter 6884 PGTT JUNCTION 16" LEASE, Comstock Oil & Gas, Inc. and Kerr-McGee Oil & Gas Onshore L.P., sitara 125899 and 132975:  Comstock's volume should exceed Kerr-McGee's volume, and together the two volumes should be approximately 73,000/d.  Currently, Comstock's volume is only 8,600/d and Kerr-McGee's volume is 25,000/d.   We look about 38,000/d short.

5.  Meter 639 HANNAH NASH, Coral Energy Resources, L.P., sitara 659998:  Is this purchase properly in the wellhead book?

I'm looking at about 10 other old deals that I think should be in for May, but aren't.  In addition, I'm adding in the new deals that will flow in May.  I'll be done by noon.

George

Having discussed the matter with Brian Riley, HPL has no intention of 
contacting Coastal to negotiate any type of deal affecting the gas received 
in September at at Meter 4179.  It was Brian's opinion that the gas should be 
considered Strangers gas since HPL has no contract or price.   It is 
suggested that Nick Moshou contact his counterpart at Coastal, relaying this 
information and suggesting Coastal's trader contract Brian Riley.

Nick,

I understand that they terminated their agreement.  However, I don't feel 
that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for the 
gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter.  
Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I 
would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call 
them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to 
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was 
shut-in.  

Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.

Mary

I am not sure who should handle this, so, I shared the "wealth".  On deal 
ticket 133259, purchase from Calpine, the deal is input at meter 4229, which, 
per the email below, was terminated.  I have an unresolvable UA4 issue at 
meter 4229 for September and for October.  I have changed the meter 
designation for November forward, however, I receive an error in Sitara when 
I attempt to change either the prior or current month.  This deal should have 
been changed to meter 6835 effective back in February of this year.  Please 
let me know what I can do to resolve this issue ASAP. 

Thanks,

Cheryl,

FYI  - Here is the message from Mary Poorman in Logistics.  

Mary,

Cheryl is going to call the field and find out if this meter should still be 
included on the termination list and also see if the field people see any gas 
flow on the meter.

Thanks,

Kathy and I are trying to clean up an unaccounted for issue at the above 
referenced meter.  The system (Pops) does not show a BAV flow or an actual 
flow for prior months.  Kathy phoned measurement to inquire about Mips 
volumes and was informed that this meter is on a disabled status list back to 
February, 2000.  I am showing a purchase from Calpine at this meter (deal 
ticket 133259) on gathering agreement 

I would greatly appreciate your help in determining the current status of 
this meter and this deal.  Please forward any information you may have.

Thank you for your time and patience,

Mary

Per our conversation I have attached below the updated version of the

volume which was 55,645 mmbtu.  After updating the spreadsheet Spinnaker will

Susan,

Please see the attached file for January's production estimate.  This is 
pretty much the final estimate except that I have calls in to Costilla &  
Walter (Superior).  They both said that they would fax their nom once it was 
complete.  Hopefully this will be by Monday.  If not, all of the traders have 
reviewed the estimate and made their changes.  I feel pretty confident that 
this is a good number.  However, if your should receive any noms before 
Monday at noon, please update the file and send it to Carlos and Daren.

Thanks and Merry Christmas to you and yours!

Bob,
I want to thank you for your response time in getting Cody a draft of the
amendment for them to look at this morning. Cody will be out of their
current obligation for this gas on February 11th, I will firm this date up 
here
in the next couple of days. Cody has requested that we strike the Gas Daily
Price for gas brought on any day other than the 1st day of the month. This 
language is mentioned in Article 2. Contract Price. 2.1 Price. I have called 
Darren Farmer on the Texas Desk and explained my situation to him. He 
passed on to me that this is not a problem since I will know the date and 
volume this package will start flowing to HPLC.  Please e-mail a copy after
these changes for approval to be sent overnight to Cody. Thanks!

I have spoken with Clem, this meter is now "non-allocatable", not unlike 
meter 8751on Big Cowboy.  This meter needs to be set up as a Receipt Meter 
attached to the Gulf Energy 27-009-08 agreement.  This gas began flowing on 
7/7/00, so deal ticket 380710, which begins 9/1/00 will need to be backed up 
to July to account for the purchase of this production.

Bob:  Please email me when the deal ticket is complete so that I can have 
Fred set up accounting arrangements on Gulf Energy.

Fred:  Can you please determine whether or not we have paid CCGM for this gas?

Once again, thank you all for your assistance.

Mary

Bob,

As mentioned earlier, Houston Exploration is also delivering gas to us at 
this meter.  The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be 
created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty   Meter   Volumes  Price    Period 
Houston Exploration  9696   8000mmbtu/d  100% GD less $0.16  2/1 - 2/28

FYI, I will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket if and when 
the gas buyer terms the deal up.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal 
and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the 
gathering contract.

Thanks,

Daren,

I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think the 
gas will flow for the month and at what price.  I will use your decision for 
our bidweek postion.

Subject: Basin Production from GA 213

I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
liquids fallout.

I checked the meter for September, there are measured volumes of 36,085 Dth 
for the month.  The meter had a purchase from MJG at the beginning of the 
month.  It looks like it was zeroed after the fact.  We are going to need to 
pay someone for  this production....I think we may need to extend the deal 
until the point at which the meter was actually shut-in.  I do not agree with 
allocating this gas to Strangers, it is not a true line gain/loss, or a 
direct result of any pipe/well work.

Please advise so that Anita and I can clean this up as promptly as possible.
