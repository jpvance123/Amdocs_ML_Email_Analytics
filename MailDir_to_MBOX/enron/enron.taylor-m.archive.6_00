This provision is an election which we have added to the Schedule for 
governmental entities.  I believe that it is intended to eliminate any 
confusion that historically arose during the debate between "First Method" 
(one-way payments) and "Second Method" (two-way payments) for Early 
Termination purposes.  Although I can't find a good reason to continue to use 
this provision with an ISDA (except that it emphasizes the point), I can 
understand why we may have added it to a pre-ISDA agreement with a 
governmental.  The only example that I could locate was our September 21, 
1995 Master Agreement with Reedy Creek Improvement District.  For those of 
you who have never seen this form, it was one of the two types of master 
agreements developed by ECT before we became conversant with ISDA.  Because 
these forms didn't contemplate municipal counterparties, we had to add many 
of the ISDA U.S. Municipal Counterparty Schedule provisions.  The Part 
5(b)(k) provision originally appeared in this early agreement.  It was 
included in the "Event of Change" section [5F(4)] (which is tantamount to the 
ISDA concept of "Illegality", a "Termination Event").  I think it was 
probably included because in the ISDA, Second Method is the automatic payment 
method if the parties fail to make a specific designation for Early 
Termination purposes, but there isn't a comparable provision in the old ECT 
form.

Mark, 

Please prepare a term sheet which can be used as a Indicative Proposal for 
our potential first Day Rate transaction.  

The key issues other than call premium that need to be clarified are the 
"posting language" and the determination period.

We will (if we reach agreement) be purchasing a series of calls and Chiles 
Offshore LLC or Seacor Smit, Inc. (the entity which is currently the majority 
owner of Chiles Offshore, LLC - but after the Chiles IPO, their interest will 
be lowered to around 25%) will be selling the calls.

The Strike Price will be at a Day Rate of  US$70,000/day 

The volume will be One (1) Rig * Day (rig multiplied times day).

Determination Period:  Jan 1, 2001 through Mar 31, 2001 

Floating Price:  We need two sets of language here - to let the customer 
choose from.

 a.   The floating price will be the Median of the High/Low of Day Rates for 
Gulf Of Mexico, Jackups "Over 300' - C", as posted in the first printing of 
the month of the Offshore Data Services, Offshore Rig Locator, page entitled 
"Competitive Offshore Rig Day Rates",   (Mark, the day rates listed in the 
June 2000 posting will be applied to each day of the preceding month (May 
2000)).

or:

 b. The floating price will be the Median of the High/Low of the Day Rate 
Range ($) for the Rigtype listed as JU-Over 300'-IC as posted each Friday of 
the month.   (Mark, the price listed on Friday the 7th, will be for the first 
7 days of the month) 

I need to send this out Friday (tomorrow) afternoon.  As we discussed, we 
need to include language that identifies that this is not definitive and 
needs Enron Corp's board approval before becoming a deal.

I will carry a copy of the posting to your office before I leave this 
evening.  

John

Bruce: Can you comment on the relative importance of the following countries 
to MG's business? It costs us about GBP 15,000 to add each country (due 
diligence and document preparation costs). I may also be able to add a

Subject: Metals due diligence

Dear Jonathan,

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries 
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading 
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are 
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals 
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - 
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for 
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals.  
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. 

Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently 
EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review.  
Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want 
to run with it?

Australia
Canada
Japan
United States

There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL 
access documentation.  
Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access 
documentation for these countries?

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Mexico
Korea
Republic of China

Regards, 

Edmund

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

ALL:

Just to clarify a couple of points:

Paul/Denis below have clearly highlighted that london group cannot trade on 
behalf of ENA.  I understand that the First Union trade was done as they had 
an agreement in place with ENA but not .Com.  Bearing in mind, that London 
traders have transacted on behalf of ENA, I expect that we should BTB these 
trades with .Com ?  (Paul/Denis)   Agreed (DOC).


If so, I suggest going forward that where we have to do a trade for ENA we 
get Mozam to do it with Markus' approval as he is based in Houston.  Assuming 
that we get the service agreement in place, we can do the risk mgmt from 
London.  If we do it like this then all other issues go away with the 
exception of service agreements which need to be put in place. 

I do not believe that it is correct to say that there is only one book. 
(Paul)  We currently have one business,two books: one in london, one in 
houston.  Each trade is booked against a specific book.  Bryan is quite happy 
to have risk reside in each book assuming legal/tax/regulatory compliance.  
There is NO other reason for BTB that I am aware of. For the resasons stated 
previously the BTB approach will simplify this issue -  the mtm of .Coms 
exposure on its portfolio of BTB's with ENA will give you the ENA's market 
risk position in respect of credit derivatives entered into by it and also 
allow easier calculation of the overall global book position. 

 All risk managment takes place here.  However we will not be able to pay out 
of ENA accounts and will have to request them to do so.  

It is quite clear that we have the necessary understanding of the issues to 
resolve so let's get this done ASAP.  Bryan can you ask Mary to arrange a 
meeting for Thurs/Fri.  Paul do you wish to conference in Houston on this ?


Regards

Dave

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided 
by the Tax group. 

London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron 
Credit.com  Ltd (not ENA.)

Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA 
(not Enron Credit.com Ltd).

Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd 
will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be 
laying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply 
laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the 
back to back. 

Assuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Credit.com Ltd an 
agreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for 
their activity and risk assumed. Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh 
Lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the 
future and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service 
agreements/fee arrangements in place.

I agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and 
hence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades. From a regulatory 
perspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not 
authorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated 
entity.  Hope this helps

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  


As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in 
ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware 
there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or 
EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should 
not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in 
Houston.  

>From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate 
trading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for 
EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the 
requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question 
for ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  

Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market 
risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate 
the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact 
that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all 
credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than 
EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA 
has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this 
internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of 
Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com 
which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection 
from.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms 
regardless of the Enron booking entity.

Mark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly 
where I haven't hit the mark !).

tks,

Denis

In reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should 
match across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two 
separate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed 
out of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into 
EnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control 
personnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.

We should try to close the open issues next week.  Could you coordinate the 
relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results.

Please could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA :

1.can be booked in London;
2. risk-managed in London 
3. do not have to be back-to-backed with Enron Credit.com 
4. there is a Service Agreement between the two entities.

My understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of 
transactions, for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Credit.com 
has bought protection on the same name. We would only need to match the terms 
where protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name.

Your response will be greatly appreciated.

Subject: Language for the Confirmation

Tana,

The language in the Schedule should reflect what is in our Form#3, whereby 
"Enron Re:" is the U.S. entity and "Swiss RE - EFR" is a Barbados entity.  
Also, the tax form requested should be a W-8.

In addition, the following language should be added to the confirmation:

United States Federal Income Tax Characterization and Reporting.  The parties 
recognize and intend that, for United States federal income tax purposes, any 
payment by [Enron Re] of the [Floating - this assumes that Enron Re is paying 
such amount] Amount will be treated as a payment pursuant to a guaranty by 
[Enron Re][of the obligations of Bob West Treasure, LLC to make payments 
pursuant to Section ___ of the [underlying Financing Agreement between Bob 
West Treasure and Royal Bank of Canada - this needs to be clarifed - is the 
payment related to the RBC loan or the insurance payment by EFR?  If it is 
the RBC loan then this clause is appropriate but if, alternatively, it is the 
EFR insurance payment, then the reference needs to be changed accordingly.]]  
The parties agree that to the extent either of the parties is required to 
report any item of income, gain, loss, deduction or credit relating to the 
Transaction for United States federal income tax purposes, such party shall 
report such item consistent with the characterization set forth above and 
shall not take any position on any tax return or report relating to United 
States federal income taxes which is inconsistent with such 
characterization.  The parties recognize that the manner in which they have 
agreed to characterize the Transaction for United States federal income tax 
purposes may be different from the manner in which the Transaction is 
characterized for non-United States federal income tax purposes and for 
accounting, regulatory or other purposes.  The provisions of this Section are 
not intended to affect the manner in which the parties report the Transaction 
for such other purposes, or the interpretation of the provisions of the 
Confirmation and the rights and obligations of the Parties arising hereunder, 
for any purposes.

To:  The Legal Trading Committee

In light of some recent comments of one of our counterparties, we are 
considering amending the Enron Canada Corp. Master Firm Gas Purchase/Sale 
Agreement (the "Master Physical Agreement") to clarify the events 
constituting  a "Seller's Deficiency Default" (see s.6.2) and a "Buyer's 
Deficiency Default" (see s.6.4).  We are also considering expanding the 
suspension rights of a "Notifying Party" to include the suspension of 
"receipts of Gas" under s.10.1.  

In this regard, please find attached a draft of an amended Master Physical 
Agreement which has been blacklined to indicate the aforementioned proposed 
changes.  

When you get the opportunity, please let me know if you think these changes 
are suitable/warranted.  I can be reached directly at (403) 974-6708.

Thanks,

Mark Powell

I suggest Mark Powell also spend time in Houston at the times Nella and Linda 
are, and that Chris Gaffney participate.  I know Mark is scheduled for a 
rotation in Houston later in the fall, but this would be a useful and focused 
trading exercise for Mark and Chris on the ISDA/financial trading 
documentation process.  Greg has just recently completed his Houston rotation 
and should be up to speed.  Additionally, Greg is scheduled for the ISDA 
Documentation workshop in Toronto on July 13th, and I want your thoughts as 
to whether Mark and/or Chris should also attend.

Matt:

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

I have only a few comments to the draft request for advice to Kim & Chang:

1) I think you should clarify that the servers for EOL are located and 
maintained outside Korea.

2) I think you should mention that in other jurisdictions we have reviewed 
(e.g., US, Australia) for the legality of weather derivatives, counsel has 
advised us that the instruments are not likely to be treated as insurance 
contracts.  This is primarily because the payout is not linked to a casualty 
event as would be the case in an insurance contract.  David Minns may have 
additional language to add here.

3) Under Weather Derivatives, delete "Osaka" and replace with "Australia".

4) Just a point of clarification, but as currently envisioned by the Korean 
commercial team (e.g., Chris Hunt, Jae-Moo and Michelle Lee) when we met with 
them here in Houston earlier this week, financial derivatives (e.g., interest 
rate, f/x) would not be traded online with Korean counterparties. Basically, 
any financial derivatives that would be traded would involve personnel likely 
located in Japan entering into via phone (e.g., conventional means) an 
interest rate hedge or f/x hedge with a Korean financial counterparty in 
order to facilitate the management of the risks carried in Enron Corp.'s 
global financial risk book in Houston. This would just be an extension of the 
services that would be performed by Enron Japan on behalf of Enron. 
Accordingly, I think we need to delete the "On-Line Financial Derivatives" 
portion of the draft request b/c I think the analysis captured in the earlier 
memos from Kim & Chang generally addresses this type of derivative activity. 
If you think otherwise, please adjust the request appropriately.  

4) As to ECTRIC's GTCs, I think you should just attach the collateral version 
for now. 

Susan : Do you have any comments to add to the request for advice from a tax 
perspective?

I have also copied David Minns on this note to keep him apprised of this 
request b/c of the Weather Derivatives piece.

Matt, assuming you receive no further comments internally, I think you should 
go ahead and finalize the request and e-mail to Kim & Chang for their review 
by the end of this week.

Regards, Alan

		 Subject: Draft EOL Legal Survey Korea

Alan/Mark/Edmund

Attached is a first draft EOL Legal Survey on Korea addressed to Kim & Chang 
for your comments/approval. Also attached are the Annexes thereto for your 
easy reference.

I understand the products to be posted online are Weather Derivatives out of 
Enron Australia, Financial Derivatives out of Enron Japan and Commodity 
Derivatives out of Enron Singapore.

I thought it sufficient to attach for Kim & Chang's review ECTRS's EOL GTC 
(with Collateral) as the operative GTCs for Commodity Derivatives. Please let 
me know if you think the without collateral version should be forwarded as 
well.

I have also assumed that Enron Japan's GTCs for Financial Trades will be 
substantially simialr to ECTRS's GTCs. Again, please advise if otherwise.

There is some reference to a more general memorandum on derivatives trading 
that Kim & Chang produced in 1996 and updated in 1999. I have attempted not 
to repeat questions that were already answered by Kim & Chang (in an attempt 
to save some cost) particularly on general issues of Financial and Commodity 
Derivatives, choice of law, dispute resolution etc.  which I thought were 
quite extensively covered. But I did request for clarification of some issues 
which I thought would be relevant to this exercise.

I have already contacted Kim & Chang to give them a "heads up". IR Huh has 
confirmed that he and SK Hong would be available to attend to our request.

Edmund, if you do not have the 1999 updated memorandum, let me know and I'll 
fax one across to you.







Thanks and regards
Matt

All,

I realise this is an aggressive timeframe, but it is important that we prove 
to both MG and outside observers that Enron can quickly and efficiently enter 
new businesses and put them onto EnronOnline.

Successfully putting MG onto EnronOnline in record time will pay dividends as 
investors start to appreciate the EnronNetWorks strategy and the broader 
Enron model.

Thanks to everyone who is working hard to make this happen.

Hi Guys

As a result of the change in plan detailed below we will need the following 
additional work to be completed:

- Legal counsel to be instructed to carry out due diligence for jurisdictions 
which are not currently covered and appear on the initial "A" list - see 
Justin's  email to Mark Taylor
- Metals due diligence for all existing jurisdictions 
- Finalisation of GTCs - need draft by Friday 16th i.e this week!

Please let me know if you have any queries.

Hi Guys

Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all 
metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties:

- All companies on new "A" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron 
copper list.doc below)
- All companies on the old "A" list (where we have a PA for the countries 
they are trading from)  (see tif file below)
- All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be 
forwarded as soon as avail)

Please be aware that the companies on the new "A" list may be a subset of the 
companies on the old "A" list.

Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above.

Both "A" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Regards

Amita

ALL:

Just to clarify a couple of points:

Paul/Denis below have clearly highlighted that london group cannot trade on 
behalf of ENA.  I understand that the First Union trade was done as they had 
an agreement in place with ENA but not .Com.  Bearing in mind, that London 
traders have transacted on behalf of ENA, I expect that we should BTB these 
trades with .Com ?  (Paul/Denis)   

If so, I suggest going forward that where we have to do a trade for ENA we 
get Mozam to do it with Markus' approval as he is based in Houston.  Assuming 
that we get the service agreement in place, we can do the risk mgmt from 
London.  If we do it like this then all other issues go away with the 
exception of service agreements which need to be put in place.

I do not believe that it is correct to say that there is only one book. 
(Paul)  We currently have one business,two books: one in london, one in 
houston.  Each trade is booked against a specific book.  Bryan is quite happy 
to have risk reside in each book assuming legal/tax/regulatory compliance.  
There is NO other reason for BTB that I am aware of.  

 All risk managment takes place here.  However we will not be able to pay out 
of ENA accounts and will have to request them to do so.  

It is quite clear that we have the necessary understanding of the issues to 
resolve so let's get this done ASAP.  Bryan can you ask Mary to arrange a 
meeting for Thurs/Fri.  Paul do you wish to conference in Houston on this ?


Regards

Dave

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided 
by the Tax group. 

London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron 
Credit.com  Ltd (not ENA.)

Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA 
(not Enron Credit.com Ltd).

Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd 
will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be 
laying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply 
laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the 
back to back. 

Assuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Credit.com Ltd an 
agreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for 
their activity and risk assumed. Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh 
Lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the 
future and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service 
agreements/fee arrangements in place.

I agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and 
hence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades. From a regulatory 
perspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not 
authorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated 
entity.  Hope this helps

Paul

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  


As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in 
ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware 
there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or 
EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should 
not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in 
Houston.  

>From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate 
trading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for 
EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the 
requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question 
for ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  

Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market 
risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate 
the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact 
that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all 
credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than 
EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA 
has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this 
internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of 
Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com 
which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection 
from.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms 
regardless of the Enron booking entity.

Mark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly 
where I haven't hit the mark !).

tks,

Denis

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

In reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should 
match across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two 
separate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed 
out of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into 
EnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control 
personnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.

We should try to close the open issues next week.  Could you coordinate the 
relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results.

thanks.

Bryan

Please could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA :

1.can be booked in London;
2. risk-managed in London 
3. do not have to be back-to-backed with Enron Credit.com 
4. there is a Service Agreement between the two entities.

My understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of 
transactions, for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Credit.com 
has bought protection on the same name. We would only need to match the terms 
where protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name.

Your response will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Elaine.

The Texas Gas Group will definitely be rolling out a "Super Peak" 5x8 product 
for gas delivery from 1300 to 2100 CDT.  If we decide to roll out another 
product, probably a "Peak" 5x12 (900 to 2100 CDT) we will let you know 
sometime today.
We will relay the prices to you on Monday.

Steve - 

One issue that immediately comes to mind is the 'General Terms and  
Conditions' ability to handle intra-day nominations. .This may require a new 
Product Type and GTC. 

Are we presently trading this product OTC, or is this unprecedented?

We are finalizing plans to introduce a new gas products(s) for July.  The

Even though we have not decided which product to introduce, I thought I would

ESA is in the middle of doing mid year reviews.  They have an automated 
system which I do not think I have access to because I work for ENA.  HR here 
is checking on how I can do the reviews for Andrea, Cecilia and Pia.  

With respect to ENA, if you are doing midyear reviews I would suggest the 
following reviewers, yourself, Lynn Aven, Andrea Calo, Maria Pia Beccaccini, 
and Mike Guerriero.

Let me know if I need to do anything else.

We are positioning ourselves to release a new Product Type that we will refer 
to as a Flexible Physical Gas product. Legal is in the process of drafting a 
GTC and Product Type description that will be used with this Product Type. I 
will start the building process once Legal provides the GTC and Product Type 
description; but in the interim, here's a broadstroke description of how the 
transaction works:

Party A and Party B exchange gas during the month of June 2000.

Party A buys 10,000 MMBtu per day (or 300,000 total MMBtu) at TCO Pool Index

Party B has the right to notify Party A of when Party B wants to take 
delivery during the month of June, and may take delivery in one of three 
forms: 3-day delivery, 5-day delivery, or 10-day delivery. The gas nominated 
for each such day would be a percentage of the total 300,000 MMBtu (i.e.; If 
Party B chooses 5 days for nomination, Party A would deliver 20% of the 
300,000 MMBtu on each of those 5 days for a total nom of 100%).  Party B pay 
TCO Pool Index PLUS a premium.

I understand that this type of transaction is currently done 
over-the-counter. Scott Mills has previously issued an explanatory e-mail of 
Sitara concerns and we should begin to address those issues.

Bjorn - if you could ask someone to prepare a Sigma Factor in advance, then 
my turn around time to for the Product Type should be reduced. Also, due to 
the varying 'optionality', do you think these three different products will 
require three different Product Types?

Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

This looks to me like it's just a wild rumour, but I thought I'd pass it 
along just in case anyone else has heard anything.

>From John Chismar:

" . . .I was out to lunch today with some traders and one of them questioned 
whether or not Platt's had contacted us yet.  His comment was that Platts was 
preparing to launch an offensive against all E trade systems that use Platt's 
as a settlement.  They want to claim a royalty or commision for each deal 
transacted.   Must be something to it as he claims there is a precedent - 
Platt's is owned by Mcgraw Hill and they publish the S & P index and 
supposedly  won a lawsuit for all trades done vs that Index.   Just thought I 
would pass this on to you as not sure if you were aware about this or if we 
had already had legal opinions about it. "

McGraw-Hill Sues Vanguard For Alleged Trademark Infringement On New Funds

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's 
Corp. unit, has filed a lawsuit in
federal court charging the Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and 
trademark infringement in connection
with the mutual fund company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or 
ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission.

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

McGraw-Hill's complaint states that Vipers differ significantly from shares 
of the open-end mutual funds that
Vanguard offered under the 1988 agreement.

Enclosed is the form of Enron Guaranty that we would propose using for 
multi-products.  Again, like the counterparty form that I sent around 
earlier,  this form will need to be modified depending upon the products that 
need to be covered and the parties involved.  Please distribute as 
appropriate to the credit group.

Mark,

In the context of our aim to introduce (physically-settled) base metals via 
EOL, I have reviewed MG's existing customer base.  There are a small number 
of counterparties from jurisdictions that have not been reviewed from here 
and I'd be grateful if you could let me know whether these have been reviewed 
by you , and also whether any of these jurisdictions are "restricted"  from a 
US perspective.  Many thanks.

Dianne, further to our conversation this morning, this e-mail will confirm 
the following:

1.  The current form of Master Physical Gas Agreement with Duke is an older 
master which indicates that transactions must be confirmed in writing and 
arguably provides that such confirms are not binding until executed by both 
parties.  However, the EnronOnline Electronic Trading Agreement indicates 
that, where a confirm is issued, it is deemed accepted unless objected to 
within three business days.  There is no indication in the EOL Electronic 
Trading Agreement how a conflict between the provisions of that agreement and 
any master agreement will be resolved, but I think that for the purposes of 
the EnronOnline transactions, we can rely on the terms of the Electronic 
Trading Agreement and, if Duke has not objected to the terms set forth in the 
EOL confirm within three business days, determine that such confirms are 
valid and binding upon the counterparty.

2.  However, with respect to any physical gas transactions entered into with 
Duke under the Master but not through EnronOnline, we still need them to 
execute and return the confirm.

3.  Regarding financial deals entered into through EnronOnline and made 
pursuant to the electronic form of GTC, the terms of the Electronic Trading 
Agreement will govern and, unless Duke objects to the terms of the confirm 
within three business days, the confirm is deemed to be valid and binding on 
Duke.

4.  Notwithstanding the above, I think we should still try to maintain our 
practice with other counterparties of obtaining executed confirms back from 
such counterparties.

Mark, if you have any concerns with these conclusions, can you please let me 
know at your earliest convenience.  Duke currently has approximately 350 
outstanding confirms entered into with ECC through the facilities of 
EnronOnline that they have not executed and returned and they have told us 
that they are relying on the Electronic Trading Agreement as providing there 
is no requirement to execute and return these confirms.

Thanks

Greg

The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided 
by the Tax group. 

London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron 
Credit.com  Ltd (not ENA.)

Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA 
(not Enron Credit.com Ltd).

Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd 
will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be 
laying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply 
laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the 
back to back. 

Assuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Credit.com Ltd an 
agreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for 
their activity and risk assumed. Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh 
Lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the 
future and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service 
agreements/fee arrangements in place.

Regards
Janine

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

I agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and 
hence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades. From a regulatory 
perspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not 
authorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated 
entity.  Hope this helps

Paul

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  


As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in 
ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware 
there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or 
EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should 
not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in 
Houston.  

>From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate 
trading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for 
EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the 
requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question 
for ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  

Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market 
risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate 
the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact 
that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all 
credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than 
EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA 
has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this 
internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of 
Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com 
which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection 
from.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms 
regardless of the Enron booking entity.

Mark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly 
where I haven't hit the mark !).

tks,

Denis

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

In reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should 
match across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two 
separate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed 
out of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into 
EnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control 
personnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.

We should try to close the open issues next week.  Could you coordinate the 
relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results.

thanks.

Bryan

Please could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA :

1.can be booked in London;
2. risk-managed in London 
3. do not have to be back-to-backed with Enron Credit.com 
4. there is a Service Agreement between the two entities.

My understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of 
transactions, for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Credit.com 
has bought protection on the same name. We would only need to match the terms 
where protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name.

Your response will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Elaine.

Mary:
Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Dear Jason

Currently, on our test site, we have

for Stock Quotes

 Current  Change  Time
ENE 68.81  +0.059  21:35 28 JUN 2000
DIS 39 5/32  -23/32  21:35 28 JUN 2000

for Headlines

UPDATE 1-US mulling best strategy in EU trade rows [Reuters (17:04)]
U.S. states urged to fight United Airlines merger [Reuters (16:57)]


What do you think?  I know we add text to the headlines when we give Reuters 
credit for them (hence the '[Reuters . . .').  Do you think we can get by 
with adding the time for the headlines?

About the stock quotes, what do you think?  I think the way it's currently 
set out makes it looks like the price on the stock market at 21:35 is exactly 
68.61 for ENE.  This is okay only if (i) that actually is the case (i.e., 
it's a Reuters time stamp from NYSE and not our own) and (ii) we're allowed 
to do that in the contract.  What's the verdict?

Sorry to bother you both, but we are at the coding stage, and the sooner I 
know that what we've been doing is correct or incorrect we can proceed or 
modify what we're doing accordingly.

Many thanks in advance

Jay

Subject: Re: Time Stamp on Stock Quotes  

We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our 
agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and 
restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are 
time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe 
that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It 
might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating 
when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a 
line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people 
using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.  
Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still 
feel like you need to add something you might check with him.

As I understand it, the answer is 'no'--we get a quote from Reuters but not 
the time stamp.  The time stamp that would appear is the one that we place 
next to it, telling the user when the quote was placed on the site.  So if 
you happen along at noon and you see 'ENE 70 9am', you know that you're most 
certainly not getting a recent price.

Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time

Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.

Two of the internet attorneys at Marval came over today to look at the system 
online.  They posed the following questions that I did not know the answer 
to.  Can you help me out on getting them a response today if possible?

1.  They would like to know the intent behind the sentence in Section (2) of 
the password application that prohibits the user form using the password 
outside their country.  I told them it was probably a tax driven issue but 
was not sure.

2.  They need to know if the user must scroll through and agree to the GTC 
each time they transact a trade.  I believe each product is represented by a 
separate line on the page and that each product has its own GTC even thought 
several related products will probably have identical GTCs.  I told them I 
thought that for each product that you only had to select it once, but that 
for each product, even if the GTC is the same as another produce you have 
reviewed, you must accept the GTC again.  Is this correct?

3.  Are the Enron trading entities signing service agreements with EOL for 
use of the system?

4.  They wanted to know if the trading entities providing the prices etc. for 
each product could be considered "content" for EOL and be considered value 
for which EOL should pay the trading entities.  I haven't heard of this issue 
before but I said I would ask.

5.  As a proof issue, what would be the process of proving and electronic 
trade?  How can we show we have not modified the screens or manipulated the 
data.  How would the data be presented to a court?  

6.  How long are the electronic trades retained in our systems and how are 
they retained?

Any help you can give me would be appreciated. 

Thanks,
Brent

Hi Guys

Please see below (and in Lara's email) some of the issues we thought needed 
to be addressed in the "back to back" agreement between Enron and MG.

Possibility of indemnity from MG re counterparty credit risk being held by 
Enron (in the event that no compensation is payable)?

Please notify Edmund if there are any other issues which need to be covered 
in this document.

Hi Janine,

As discussed here is our list of topics we feel the 'Sleeving' Agreement 
should cover.  We think that it should remain as broad as possible to avoid a 
delay in Legal negotiations over the finer details.

Please let us know your thoughts and we will send these up to Justin.  If you 
could please review this as soon as possible, we would appreciate it as 
Justin is out of the office next week.

Confidentiality - covering all EnronOnline applications and trading strategies
Performance of obligation to deliver / receive product
Invoices and Confirmations - confirmations for EOL deals should be processed 
by MG staff and sent out with proper Enron entity, also send confirms to Enron
Assumption of underlying position by MG - Enron fully transfers positions to 
MG
Provision of data feeds - i.e. information to the Credit Aggregation System 
and/or to the RAC value at risk system
Information provision- for Management Reporting purposes
Compensation for Credit risk taken? -  please advise if you feel this is 
necessary.

Thank you!

Hi Guys

Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all 
metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties:

- All companies on new "A" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron 
copper list.doc below)
- All companies on the old "A" list (where we have a PA for the countries 
they are trading from)  (see tif file below)
- All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be 
forwarded as soon as avail)

Please be aware that the companies on the new "A" list may be a subset of the 
companies on the old "A" list.

Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above.

Both "A" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Regards

Amita

Amita,

Credit Risk - I am of a mind for Enron to accept the credit risk of metals 
transactions done through EnronOnline, bearing in mind that it will be Enron 
credit  criteria which is applied, the short timeline and the fact that this 
sleeving agreement is intended to be a temporary arrangement until conclusion 
of the final purchase agreement. If it can be set up so they take the risk, 
then fine - but don't allow this to delay the process.

Confidentiality - I assume we are covered by the current C.A. Please confirm 
with Eric Gadd.

Performance - Enron's obligation is to the customer and MG's obligation is to 
us.

Invoices - Probably  prepared by MG and sent on Enron letterhead. We can 
download EnronOnline Transaction info. to MG if required. Please check with 
backoffice on this.

Position - Assumed by MG

Data Feeds - as normal for EnronOnline, with the addition of the financial 
product price and volume info. which we have discussed.

Compensation for credit risk - See above note

Dave

Mark,

We intend to relax the Read-Only restrictions on credit derivative products 
so that all customers will have Read Only Access (currently they do not).

We are not changing Execution status at this point.

Any objections?

Dear Dave

Thanks for forwarding this. It does look very good.

Just a couple of comments:

1. With respect to a disclaimer on content, although Enron does have an
indemnity, it may be worth putting in place some preventative measures just
in case -  I suggest something along the lines of "The information on this
site is provided solely by Sports.com [and its licensors]. However, neither
Enron nor Sports.com take any responsibility or make any warranty about the
accuracy or completeness of such information and any reliance you place on
it is at your own risk"

2. I tried clicking on the Minutemania link and nothing happened. I just
wanted to check the registration page, if there already is one.

PLease contact me if you have any questions.

Kind regards

Marly Didizian

Here is what the proposed site would look like following the link from the
EnronOnline quotes screen.  From a commercial and design perspective it
looks
great.  Any legal issues?

Louise raised the idea that we may want to add a disclaimer that the content
is
provided by Sports.com.  I told her that we had an indemnification from them
with respect to libel, etc.   Please let me know if you think we need to add
this.

Peter
got your voice but it was a little late to call. I will call you tonight. But 
let me briefly cover the points you mentioned

On insurance I have faxed across our legal opinion on weather. We prepared a 
detailed discussion on insurance in a schedule. But the main point is that 
there is no  nexus between damage/loss suffered by a party and payments under 
the weather derivative. 
On access to data Christian Werner in Sydney is researching alternatives. I 
was proposing to forward details of these arrangements so they could be 
double checked by B &M.
Mark Taylor has been copied in on our documentation (GTCs and product 
description form) for Australian weather. We have also been working with Paul 
Simon, Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd in London.  

Korea is becoming more of a possibility. Although not settled that we will be 
offering these products it is becoming more likely.  Hence we may have some 
work there.

Subject: EOL Weather Derivatives - Japan (Legal Advice)

Alan further to our discussion last week. Attached is request for further 
advice from Baker and McKenzie on trading weather products with Japanese 
counterparties through EOL. As discussed would you forward it to B & M. The 
date of the previous advice which indicated there are no regulatory issues 
with weather trading needs to be inserted in 2 places. (Would you be able to 
send me a copy of this advice.) 

We need to have all legal issues resolved prior to 23 June.   This is the 
scheduled date for function the public function to launch of EOL weather 
trading in Australia .  We plan to trade Tokyo and Osaka   in addition to 
Australian cities. There was discussion of  Seoul weather products but this 
has not progressed. If it does then will need to do the required due 
diligence for Korea.

How could they justify going after only electronic traded deals. Wouldn't 
they need to attack all deals done ever using a Platt's price as a reference 
price ? Good Luck..

Tana,
I'm with Risk Assessment and Control and I'm currently not trading in the 
account.  (It is an old account that was opened before I started at Enron.  I 
haven't traded in it because Enron appears to trade in everything! )  
However, since I have you,  I am currently considering buying some options in 
soybeans. Would this be against Enron policy?  
Thanks,

Thanks for your response.  Yes, I I do need to know two things.  First, the 
group you are in, and then second, what products you are trading out of the 
account.  The Enron Trading Policy prohibits employees from trading in any of 
the products the company trades in.

Enclosed is the Counterparty form that we have come up with for Multi-Product 
Guarantys.  Depending upon the products that need to be covered, each 
Guaranty will need to be modified to make sure that it describes the proper 
entities and products.  I will send along the Enron form of this shortly but 
please pass this along to the appropriate people in the credit group.

Jeff, Stacy and Harry,
Are you going to change the Physical product form of Guaranty to look more 
like this?  Power has changed their form and it may help for us to all be 
consistent especially when we are asked to amend an existing Guaranty to 
include more products.  If you do decide to amend your form, please send the 
new form to credit.

Thanks for everyone's input.

Brent: 

I have added language to Section 9 that addresses specific Argentine issues.  
My comments  are in blue in the document that I have attached.    

Since Marval will be looking at the legal issues  and since I know that they 
had good tax counsel as well, I will be using them for tax advice for this 
project so that the relevant legal and tax issues can be discussed among 
members of the firm.

The turnover tax will of course be an issue with the EOL physical trades in 
Argentina.   I have not raised that issue since it is being addressed 
separately.  I think it will be better to keep this work focused on the EOL 
specific issues.

This looks fine to me.  The tax section of the draft was a holdover from the 
initial survey done in Europe last year.  In this case, I assume that Lynn is 
taking care of the tax issues and may be using different counsel for tax 
issues.  In Brazil the entire tax section of the memo was deleted before it 
was sent to counsel.

Mark here is my markup to the survey.  I tried to be more specific in a few 
areas to adjust it to what is likely to happen in Argentina.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.

more specifically handle the unique tax situation in Argentina.

Rahil,

Attached is the powerpoint template that we (Viant) put together.  Mike and
Dave believe this is the version that we want to go with, but we should
check with Kal since he spent time on the ppt template that he developed.

Also attached is the functional spec for the FYINet powerpoint player.

In addition, you will want to have legal review the copyright trademark at 
the bottom of the template.  There was some concern that EnronOnline is not a 
legal entity.

thanks, Karen

Pursuant to our meeting the other day, I would like to lay out the approval 
plan for the EnronOnline content.

Legal and Public Affairs will compile a list of statements which definitely 
are restricted and a list of grey area issues. (such as no trading advise)

All content for Phase 2 will be forwarded to Mark Taylor, Mark Palmer, John 
Gilchrist, Mike Danielson and Bob Shults.  Mark Taylor and Mark Palmer will 
approve all content for Phase 2.

Legal and Public Relations will determine which components of the content 
create potential hot spots and will discuss with Bob Shults/Mike 
Danielson/Shah

Legal will provide disclaimer copy for the web site that is global in scope 
and provide the appropriate font and location requirements

Once Public Relations and Legal get comfortable, content providers will 
follow restriction list and use best judgement to determine the need for 
Public Relations and Legal review.

Bob Shults will visit with Mark Koenig to identify Investor Relations issues.


If you have any issues or questions with the above please advise.

Mark, I hope you can help me with two things further to our meeting last 
Thursday re the swap rep in our commodity agreements:

I'm trying to track down the evolution of EES's swap rep.  Would you send me 
a copy of ENA's swap rep so that I can confirm that EES uses the same one?
Paige is out on parental leave.  Georgeanne Hodges recommends I speak to Cris 
Sherman.  Do you agree, or would you suggest someone else?

Thanks for your help.

Melinda,

I'm sorry to pass you off to someone else, but I really am not the right 
person to answer this.  I would try the transaction accounting department 
either in ENA or EES.  In ENA, I would speak to Cris Sherman or in EES, I 
believe that it is Wade Stubblefied.

Subject: Customer Representation

Paige, Mark Taylor suggested I speak to you re the GAAP aspect of the bold 
language in the provision set out below.  This provision, which we refer to 
as the "swap rep," is based on a Commodities & Futures Trading Commission 
regulation and is in our commodity forms.  Could I calculate these amounts 
per GAAP, i.e, does GAAP define "tangible net worth"?  Does GAAP define "net 
worth"?  If GAAP does not define "tangible net worth" or "net worth," does it 
speak to the components that would make up these terms?  Which "value" would 
be applicable per GAAP - book, fair market or some other value?

Additional Representations and Warranties of Customer.  Customer further 
represents and warrants that (a) it has entered into this Agreement based 
solely upon the express representations and warranties set forth in this 
Agreement; (b) it has received a notice from EESI with respect to the 
disclosure of certain customer information to EESI by Utility(ies) and has no 
objection to such disclosure; (c) whenever EESI exercises an EESI Energy 
Sales Option, Customer shall purchase energy from EESI to satisfy the energy 
requirements of each Facility and shall not resell any portion of such energy 
to any third party; (d) it either (i) owns assets with a value in excess of 
ten million dollars ($10,000,000) or (ii) has a tangible net worth in excess 
of one million dollars ($1,000,000), in each case calculated according to 
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied; and (e) it is 
a producer, processor, commercial user of, or merchant handling the commodity 
subject to this Agreement or the product or by-products thereof, and it has 
entered into this Agreement solely for non-speculative purposes related to 
its business as such.

Please call me with any questions or to discuss further.  Also, please let me 
know if you want to forward this inquiry to anyone else.  Thanks in advance 
for your help.

As you work through these issues, please remember that even though the Mexico

expect many other products to appeal to their customers, the EnronOnline 
people will expect all products listed online to be available unless we can 
articulate a compelling reason to restrict them.

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through 
EnronOnLine and, potentially, a separate ENA Mexican entity.  I should be 
able to provide the results by Friday or Monday.  Please contact me at ext. 
35777 if you'd like to discuss in the meantime.

Best regards,

Jeff

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

According to legal, we have no jurisdiction over the domain name or its use.  

Therefore we have no reason to become involved ( notify either party etc).

Obviously we would not pursue any activity similar to this.

The spectrononline problem.

trader at Alliance Gas.  We have had no knowledge of this until one of our

Please could you advise if we need to do anything (eg notify Spectron ,

excellent ruse!  We heard about this through other brokers who heard it from 
a counterparty.  However I tried the same for ICAPonline and 
intercapitalonline after Derek joked with them that we'd done it for all the 
other brokers, and they had no sites.  I wonder if they'll reserve the sites 
for themselves now that their minds have been focused, if you were thinking 
of doing the same for other brokers names, we should get moving.

Hope Houston's treating you well,

Edmund,

These jurisdictions will be looked after by U.S. legal, however, we do not 
have any legal contacts there. Do you know if MG does?

Subject: Exempt Market Declaration - Australia

Today I spoke to the Jillian Segall, National Commissioner of the Australian 
Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC).   I have arranged a meeting  
with her and staff handling our application next Wednesday afternoon. Paul 
and I will go and we will take Mallesons. I have foreshadowed to her that we 
would be willing to withdraw and resubmit our application (addressing 
credit/prudential issues as ASIC staff had suggested to Mallesons). However 
we would like to explain face to face the circumstances. I said that we 
didn't want any impression that Enron had either lost interest or were acting 
in a fit of pique. Quite the contrary we see the grant of the Exempt Market 
Declaration as critical and appreciate their efforts to date. (Considering 
Paul Q's well known aversion to blunt talking I thought it wise to foreshadow 
what we wanted to cover, as follows.) 
We understand that unless we can comply with the exact requirements of Policy 
Statement 70 (para 50) then ASIC believes it is required to make new policy 
and could not act within the time frame we require. The Minister's office 
indicated he could not attend the launch of a product that was the subject of 
an EMD application. Withdrawing the application whilst we clarify the credit 
issues would remove this timing pressure from ASIC.
We have made the determination that an EMD is not required for us to launch 
weather products on EOL. That being  the grant of an EMD (especially with 
CLERP 6 coming early next year) is the regulatory certainty that Enron would 
require if its plans to develop Sydney as a regional centre were are to 
progress.
I indicated we would also be expressing our suggestions on ASIC concerns with 
procedures that purport to oversee creditworthiness of market participants.

In essence it was a most positive discussion. Assuming all falls into place 
we can maintain our strategy of using the political support to get an EMD 
whilst  allowing  the launch to go ahead next month. Enron Australia is also 
seen as conciliatory to ASIC's concerns whilst maintaining the pressure.

Paul (Simons) we appreciate your ongoing help. We also understand the 
sensitivity at present re an EEFT guarantee.

Subject: Counterparties to whom metals products will be available

Hi Guys

Slight change of plan on the counterparty front - we will be offering all 
metals products (currently two phys products) to the following counterparties:

- All companies on new "A" list  (see Enron aluminium list.doc and Enron 
copper list.doc below)
- All companies on the old "A" list (where we have a PA for the countries 
they are trading from)  (see tif file below)
- All exisiting companies on EnronOnline (list as in EOL - copy will be 
forwarded as soon as avail)

Please be aware that the companies on the new "A" list may be a subset of the 
companies on the old "A" list.

Please proceed with your review process on the basis of the above.

Both "A" lists are attached below for your ease of reference.

Regards

Amita

Dear Jonathan,

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries 
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading 
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are 
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals 
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - 
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for 
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals.  
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. 

Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently 
EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review.  
Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want 
to run with it?

Australia
Canada
Japan
United States

There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL 
access documentation.  
Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access 
documentation for these countries?

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Mexico
Korea
Republic of China

Regards, 

Edmund

it to this market.  Please review it so that there aren't any problems from

Dave,

We've had meeting today to discuss jurisdictions that we want to get up and 
running on EOL for seafreight derivatives.  The result is as follows:

1.  Conduct the quick follow-up derivatives due diligence for the existing 
EOL countries.

2. Commence internet regulatory, tax and derivatives due diligence for the 
following countries:

Greece
Israel
Turkey

3.  In addition we would like to add Hong Kong.  Mark may have already 
started this in Houston(?).

Let me know if you are happy wish this and I will set the ball rolling.  I 
will also advise if we wish to look at further jurisdictions.

Regards, 

Edmund

Subject: freight derivatives - EOL

I have trawled through the list of jurisdictions of potential counterparties 
to the freight swaps/options.

A list
Norway
Denmark
Germany
Switzerland
UK
Belgium
France 
Netherlands
Singapore 
Australia

We have already done full EOL due diligence on the above jurisdictions. The 
only issue which we wd just need to cover is whether for regulatory purposes 
freight is treated as a commodity. We shd be able to get answers on that 
issue quickly. 

B list
Turkey
Taiwan
Japan
Argentina
Israel
Gibraltar
S. Korea

We do not have much on the above jurisdictions here although Mark T may have 
done some due diligence on the non- European, non-middle eastern countries. 
Do you want us to undertake full due diligence on these?

C list
Liberia
Panama
Cayman Isl
BVI
Bermuda
Bahamas
BWI

I understand that decisions may have already been made not to include 
entities incorporated into these jurisdictions, because of money laundering 
issues, lack of corporate transparency etc. Cd this be confirmed. 

Many thanks

Robert

Carol,

I've been working with Jaime Williams and our outside tax advisors to 
determine the Mexican tax consequences applicable to those products that 
Jaime has informed me will be offered to Mexican counterparties through

Jeff:
As I think you are aware, the Meixco and online group want to implement 
online trading for Mexican counterparties.  Are there any tax issues taht we 
should be aware of?  If we conduct online trades using ENA and telephone 
trades with an Enron Mexican entity, will the exercise of setoff rights 
create any tax issues?   My understanding is that the Enron counterparty will 
be ENA.

Dear Alan and Mark,

I have attached a spreadsheet containing two lists: one containing existing 
EnronOnline counterparties; one containing existing Metalgesellschaft 
counterparties.  

Justin and I have been through these lists and have marked as unacceptable 
(with an "X") those counterparties from jurisdictions with which we are 
currently unable to trade physical commodities via EnronOnline.

In respect of US and Canadian counterparties we assume that there are no 
difficulties with trading physically settled metals commodities, but we would 
appreciate your thoughts and clearance on this issue.

Do let us know if you need any further information on this.

Best regards,

Edmund

I think that the new format is a big-time improvement over our previous 
method.  It is still confusing, but I think that it is logical and spread 
traders should be able to pick it up rather quickly.  Let me know what you

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Mark further our discussion today on Deemed ISDAs in Australia. 6 Deemed ISDA 
Agreements were signed over the period late 1998 through to mid 1999. This 
was due to I believe an unwillingness on the part of Enron to enter into a 
ISDA Master Agreement that did not meet the then corporate requirements. I 
have commenced a program of replacing these Deemed ISDAs with full ISDAs. 
Apart from the obvious documentary issues, the status of a Deemed ISDA re EOL 
is somewhat uncertain.

To date we have 22 settled ISDAs including 5 Deemed ISDAs.(see attached 
list). The Deemed ISDA with RMB was replaced last month.

FOREIGN NARCOTICS KINGPIN DESIGNATION ACT OF 1999

On June 1, 2000, the Treasury Department expanded its list of Specially 
Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking 
Sanctions Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and 
individuals designated as "SDNTKs" (Specially Designated Narcotics 
Traffickers under the Kingpin Act).  The Kingpin Act blocks all property and 
interests in property subject to U.S. jurisdiction, owned or controlled by 
significant foreign narcotics traffickers as identified by President Clinton. 

The targets of this measure are major narcotics traffickers and trafficking 
organizations based in Afghanistan, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, the Dominican 
Republic, Laos, Mexico, Pakistan, the People's Republic of China, Peru, 
Russia, and Thailand.

U.S. persons are prohibited from engaging in any transaction or dealing in 
property or interests in property of SDNTKs and from engaging in any 
transaction that evades or avoids the prohibition of the Kingpin Act.  These 
prohibitions affect trade transactions as well as accounts, securities, and 
other assets.

Reflecting the concern of many in Congress that current civil penalties 
related to the export control and economic sanctions violations (normally, 
$10,000 to $11,000) do not sufficiently deter prohibited conduct, the Act 
authorizes civil penalties of up to $1,000,000.

Lybia, Iran, Iraq, Yugoslavia, Cuba, North Korea, Angola, etc., can also be

Black/SA/Enron@Enron, Brett R Wiggs/SA/Enron@Enron 

Subject: PIS/Cofins taxes on Brazil Trading Operations

Under current Brazilian tax law, the general rule is that  PIS/Cofins taxes 
are due on the gross revenue that a a company receives.  In regards to 
certain activities, including the trading activity that Enron wants to engage 
in, there is a position that is supported by various law firms and by Arthur 
Andersen that the PIS/Cofins tax is payable only on the trading margin.  We 
have received a written opinion from the LaCaz Martin law firm supporting 
this position and Arthur Andersen has advised that they have a number of 
clients that are taking this position in filing their PIS/Cofins tax returns.

Discussions with LaCaz Martins have indicated that the position they advocate 
is not one that the Brazilian tax authorities will currently follow nor one 
that is without risk.    Arthur Andersen has confirmed that their clients who 
take this position are required to  book a reserve for financial accounting 
purposes pending the resolution of the issue.  Consequently, the earnings 
impact of the PIS/Cofins tax will be the same for financial reporting 
purposes whether or not the cash taxes are paid.  (LaCaz acknowledges that 
the reserve must be booked)

There seems to be a great deal of optimism in Brazil that the PIS/Cofins will 
be clarified as part of the pending tax reform.  The current proposals that 
are being considered clearly state that the PIS/Cofins tax will be a 
noncumulative tax similar to the ICMS (VAT) tax that exists.    Tax reform 
appears to be a priority right now and hopefully there will be a resolution 
of this issue so that we can move forward knowing that Enron's trading 
margins will not be negatively impacted by the imposition of the PIS/Cofins 
tax on the total revenue.

Unfortunately, the proposed legislation is anticipated to become effective in 
2003, based upon an ageement between the President of Brazil and the 
legislature that serves to keep the tax revenues high in the short term in 
return for implementing a tax regime in later years that will support 
business development.  This leaves Enron with the issue of how to treat 
trading transaction that are consummated before 2003.

If the Enron trading company pays the PIS Cofins tax on its net margin rather 
than on it gross revenue under the current law that is anticipated to be in 
place until 2003, there is a strong likelihood that the revenue authorities 
will asses additional tax.  Resolution of that tax dispute can be decided at 
the Supreme Court level.  Our advisors have indicated that the resolution of 
the dispute at the Supreme Court does involve some  political issues and  
that the taxpayer is more likely to get a favorable decision if the dispute 
is resolved after the law has been changed.  In other words, although the 
taxpayers have a strong argument to pay the tax on the net margin under the 
current law, the Supreme Court would likely not rule in their favor because 
of the current political climate but would likely rule differently once the 
law had been clarified and the intent clearly stated.

I am hopeful that we will get a resolution of the application of the 
PIS/Cofins tax before the end of 2000.    We can then know for certain that 
only the trading margins will be subject to the PIS/Cofins taxes.  However, 
even if we get a favorable resolution, we still need to assess the risk for 
the years prior to the effective date of the legislation.    Not only is 
their the possibility that the tax will be assessed for years prior to the 
effective date of the new legislation, there is the possibility that 
penalties and interest will be imposed.   I am working with Arthur Andersen 
in quantifying the exposure to interest and penalties and determining various 
legal processes to minimize those costs should the trading company get an 
assessment.   

Getting tax relief under our broad tax reform legislation will be the easiest 
way to achieve the goal of limiting the impact of the PIS/Cofins tax.  
However, if tax reform does not succeed, Enron may need to partner with 
financial institutions that are attempting to do similar trading 
transaction.  Financial institutions and their lobbyists in Brazil have a 
much better track record in getting industry specific tax relief.

I will continue to monitor tax reform.  Our advisors have indicated that the 
tax reform movement is so strong that Enron would likely have little impact 
on the process if it were directly involved in monitoring change.     The 
issue to get directly involved in tax reform needs to be made by ESA 
management.  I will be glad to help develop the issues so that the 
appropriate persons can present the case for tax reform if deemed necessary.

Regards

Lynn

own account of thr the account of any third party) where such Position 
relates to (i) any financial instrument, security, financial asset or 
liability whch falls within  such employee's responsibility at an Enron 
Compay or (ii) any other commodity included in any Commodity Group."

Administration of this policy has been limited to the efforts of Mark Taylor 
and Tana Jones in the Legal Department primarily consisting of employees 
"confessing" to trading certain products.    In the past, if the product has 
been one that Enron does not trade, the employee is told that it is ok.  If 
it is a product that we do trade, then they are informed to comply with 
policy.    Restrictions on the trading of financial instruments, such as 
equities, interest rates and foriegn exchange have been limited to those that 
are currently managing those books for an Enron Company or those who might 
have access to information that was not in the public domain.

Generally, we have found that people have traded yen, S&P futures, metals and 
agricultural products.   Now that we have authorized the trading of a wide 
variety of agricultural products and metals, we may need to advise employees 
not to trade them (immediately, soon, never???).   We may also consider 
changing the policy or altering our enforcement methods.

Please advise your guidance as to how to proceed.

Dave,

Everyone of these countries is important to physical and financial trading.  
Ranking the countries 

Chile - number one copper producing country in the world
China - very big consumer/trader/producer in copper, ally, zinc etc
Peru - very large producer of copper, lead, zinc precious
Brazil - large producer/consumer
Korea - very large consumer of all metals

To me it is an issue of time for all of these countries.

regards,
bruce

Subject: Metals due diligence

Dear Jonathan,

Following our earlier telephone conversation, here is the list of countries 
for which we need to undertake follow-up commodity due diligence for trading 
physical metals products.  As the initial two products to be offered are 
aluminium and copper we should restrict the due diligence to base metals 
only.  In addition, let's ask for the position on cash-settled derivatives - 
should involve only a follow-up question asking whether previous advice for 
energy commodity derivatives changes in respect of derivatives on metals.  
However, the initial focus should be on the physical trading questions. 

Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, 
Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, Slovenia, 
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom

Also, there is the following list of countries, for which there is currently 
EOL access documentation which will need to have the same review.  
Mark - do you want us to handle the due diligence over here, or do you want 
to run with it?

Australia
Canada
Japan
United States

There is a third list of countries for which we currently do not have EOL 
access documentation.  
Dave/Amita/Mark - Are we going to proceed with preparing such access 
documentation for these countries?

Chile
Brazil
Peru
Mexico
Korea
Republic of China

Regards, 

Edmund

excellent ruse!  We heard about this through other brokers who heard it from 
a counterparty.  However I tried the same for ICAPonline and 
intercapitalonline after Derek joked with them that we'd done it for all the 
other brokers, and they had no sites.  I wonder if they'll reserve the sites 
for themselves now that their minds have been focused, if you were thinking 
of doing the same for other brokers names, we should get moving.

Hope Houston's treating you well,

Team:

Attached is the last version of the memorandum from Pinheiro Neto addressing 
the questionnaire prepared by Mark Taylor. I suggest that we all take a look 
at it and identify questions and areas that we would like PN to expand or 
further explain. We could then schedule a conference call to share our 
thoughts and define next steps. I will be out of the office Monday through 
Wednesday next week. Thursday and Friday are holidays in Brazil. Please let 
me know how your schedule looks like from the 26th on so we can schedule 
something. Thanks.

I agree with Denis' remarks especially about there being a single book and 
hence the need for matching terms and back-to-back trades. From a regulatory 
perspective, you don't want to book ENA's trades in London since it is not 
authorised to deals here and is not acting through EEFT, our SFA regulated 
entity.  Hope this helps

Paul

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  


As I understand it from a tax and legal perspectibe transactions booked in 
ENA should be executed by a trader sitting in Houston.  As far as I am aware 
there is no brokerage or agency arrangement with either EFT or 
EnronCredit.com in this regard and therefore traders sitting in London should 
not execute these transactions independently of the traders sitting in 
Houston.  

>From a booking perspective in this type of situation generally a separate 
trading book should be mainatined by ENA.  It may be acceptable for 
EnronCredit.com to risk manage ENA's credit derivaties postions provided the 
requisite service agreement has been put in place - this is really a question 
for ENA - Mark ?.  I do not know if such a service agreement is in place.  

Where a transaction is booked into ENA and not bt-backed with .Com the market 
risk will reside with ENA - a btb with .Com would be necessary to consolidate 
the mtm of the ENA credit derivatives business in .Com.  In view of the fact 
that Bryan is viewing all credit derivatives business as a global book, all 
credit derivatives business entered into by Enron entities other than 
EnronCredit.com should be back-to-backed with .Com.  In situations where ENA 
has sold protection and .Com has bought protection on the same name this 
internal structure will permit ENA immediately Delivering on the Portfolio of 
Deliverable Obligations it as received as the Seller of protection to .Com 
which can in turn can Deliver on to the counterparty it has bought protection 
from.  As a result all hedged trandsactions should have matched terms 
regardless of the Enron booking entity.

Mark, Paul can you add further clarification as to the position (particularly 
where I haven't hit the mark !).

tks,

Denis

Subject: Re: ENA / Enron Credit.com  

In reality, I think of there being a single global book and terms should 
match across internal legal entities.  The only reason for booking into two 
separate entities is for Tax and/or regulatory reasons.  The risk is managed 
out of London, I don't think there is any reason to back-to-back trades into 
EnronCredit.com but will defer to the appropriate tax, legal and control 
personnel.  I don't think a services agreement has been set up yet.

We should try to close the open issues next week.  Could you coordinate the 
relevant parties to ensure satisfactory results.

thanks.

Bryan

Please could you confirm that CDS trades done by ENA :

1.can be booked in London;
2. risk-managed in London 
3. do not have to be back-to-backed with Enron Credit.com 
4. there is a Service Agreement between the two entities.

My understanding of this is that we would not need to match the terms of 
transactions, for example where ENA has sold protection and Enron Credit.com 
has bought protection on the same name. We would only need to match the terms 
where protection is bought and sold by the same Legal entity on the same name.

Your response will be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,
Elaine.

I have trawled through the list of jurisdictions of potential counterparties 
to the freight swaps/options.

A list
Norway
Denmark
Germany
Switzerland
UK
Belgium
France 
Netherlands
Singapore 
Australia

We have already done full EOL due diligence on the above jurisdictions. The 
only issue which we wd just need to cover is whether for regulatory purposes 
freight is treated as a commodity. We shd be able to get answers on that 
issue quickly. 

B list
Turkey
Taiwan
Japan
Argentina
Israel
Gibraltar
S. Korea

We do not have much on the above jurisdictions here although Mark T may have 
done some due diligence on the non- European, non-middle eastern countries. 
Do you want us to undertake full due diligence on these?

C list
Liberia
Panama
Cayman Isl
BVI
Bermuda
Bahamas
BWI

I understand that decisions may have already been made not to include 
entities incorporated into these jurisdictions, because of money laundering 
issues, lack of corporate transparency etc. Cd this be confirmed. 

Many thanks

Robert

I am working with outside counsel to prepare a standard set of guidelines to 
be applied in generating content for EOL.  However, I wanted to circulate a 
few general rules of thumb since the final guidelines are not yet ready.

1.  Use of CP names.  As a rule, I would advise against including 
counterparty names in EOL content.  Whether we have the rights to publish a 
name depends upon the contractual relationship with the particular 
counterparty.  As a general rule, I therefore recommend that we just don't 
use names.

2.  Publication of Third Party Content.  If we have a contractual 
relationship with a content provider, we cannot republish information -- 
either in its original form or in a compilation -- unless the republication 
is permitted by the underlying contract.  So, the information should not be 
used unless legal has reviewed the contract.  Since this review takes time, 
it's best to avoid using the information if possible.  With regard to other 
third party sources, I am also concerned about republishing either direct 
copies of or compilations of information derived from third-party sources and 
thus advise that if at all possible, internally generated graphs, charts, 
etc. is much to be preferred.  We need to discuss this issue in greater 
detail early next week.  If we determine that it is desirable to use a 
particular source for a good deal of content, it might make sense to approach 
the content provider to obtain express rights of republication.

3.  General Advisory Language:  We need to avoid language that leads to the 
implication that we are providing advisory services to our counterparties.  
We intend to beef up the Legal and Privacy Statement to make clear that Enron 
is an arms-length trading partner, not an advisor.  However, the content 
included in the site needs to be consistent with this statement.  
Accordingly, we need to avoid phrases like "we can help you" (compare to "we 
offer products that can help you"), "services", "partner", etc.   I'd like to 
consider deleting from Kal's presentations all information relating to 
Capital Financing, Debt and Equity and Project Financing.  For direct market 
literature, I think these types of discussions have a lot of value.  However, 
the EnronOnline garden may not be an appropriate venue for the information.  
Let's think about this one.

4.  Balance:  We need to avoid "puffery" and ensure that all presentations 
are balances.  Thus, we need to present the downside as well as the upside of 
utilizing various products in a balanced manner.  In general, I'm okay with 
the content I've seen thus far on this point, but it is a rule of thumb we 
all need to follow.

Leslie

Carol I'm having trouble with a few counterparties who, like Enron require an 
exclusion of "consequential" losses. Currently under our ETA  the exclusion 
for  liability consequential losses/damage only applies to Enron. There is 
however, a mutual exclusion of limitation of libility in the GTCs and our 
ISDAs. The major issue  I see is to ensure that we are covered for trades 
that are performed by persons with a password obtained through the 
counterparty. If we cover that point have we some scope to exclude the 
indemnity we require  from applying to  loss of profits?

David

Further to the Electronic Trading Agreement, hopefully the following can
move us closer to a resolution.

To summarise the position:
* I agree that we need to replace the deemed ISDA Agreement.  Please
forward a copy of the Schedule for our review.
* UE agrees to acknowledge a letter from Enron stating that the Deemed
ISDA Agreement is a master agreement for the purposes of the ETA.
* You have stated that counterparties can control their access to
Enron products, UE agrees to control the access to EnronOnLine so that at
this stage, UE only trades with Enron Australia Finance for Australian power
traders.  Prior to trading in other products, UE will ensure that a master
agreement is in place with the relevant Enron entity.
* With respect to Section 4(b) of the ETA, UE cannot agree to include
consequential losses.  As we have indicated before, we do not believe that
this is a risk which should be borne by UE, rather it is a risk that is
better dealt with by Enron in their insurances covering business disasters
etc.  Would it assist if further definition was included for consequential
loss to tighten this definition?  This would be along the lines of excluding
loss of profits etc.


Unfortunately this consequential loss clause appears to be holding trading
up.  If Enron is unable to agree to this amendment we may need to seek an
alternative method of trading.  For example, is it possible for UE to view
the EnronOnline site without any access rights - this may facilitate trading
albeit trading via the telephone?

Regards
Peggy

SUMMARY

                     Congress has enacted landmark legislation that for the 
first time will
establish national standards governing the validity of electronic signatures, 
contracts and records.
The "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act" is expected 
to be signed into
law by President Clinton this week or next.  Many provisions of the Act 
relating to the validity of
electronic signatures will become effective on October 1, 2000.  Other 
significant provisions relating
to the maintenance and retention of records will become effective March 1, 
2001.

Paul, further to our discussion last Friday. Attached is a complete copy of 
Policy Statement 70 referenced in my earlier email. Paragraph PS70.50 
contains the statement that authorisation under the SFA is considered to be 
an adequate regime for monitoring capital adequacy.   The SFA oversight  must 
apply to either the entity that is trading under the Australian Exempt Market 
Declaration as  or its guarantor. It is also in the this paragraph that the 
reference to "low risk firms" is made. 

Once you get a response to your enquiries we look forward to hearing whether 
the provision of the guarantee is feasible.

Subject: Guarantee from EEFT of Enron Australia Finance

Paul further to my email/voicemail on our attempts to get an Exempt Market 
Declaration issued to Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd (EAF).  I now have a 
specific request to put to you.

It appears that we would qualify for such a  Declaration thereby allowing EAF 
to use the safe harbour provisions under the Australian Corporations Law for  
trading through EnronOnline if EAF had get a guarantee from  Enron Europe 
Finance and Trading Ltd. We would be able to take advantage of a specific 
provision in the policy guideline of the Australian Securities and 
Investments Commission on the grant of Declarations known as Policy Statement 
70. (Below is a summary of the relevant provisions of the Policy Statement.) 
Would the provision of such a guarantee be possible? 

Clearly an issue to consider would be any possible impact on EEFT's 
prudential requirements under the Financial Services Act. If this were an 
issue perhaps could it be overcome if there was a back to back guaranty from 
say Enron Corp. to EEFT. This mean that effectively EEFT would have no 
additional exposure.

I am pleased to announce a new large scale steel piece completed for the
show "Once Removed" at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, New
York.  Almost 8 tons of steel, over 500 pieces of Cor-ten steel
attached by nearly 4500 stainless steel bolts and measuring 23 feet in
length and 28 feet in width, this flexible structure slumps and slides
across the landscape.  A continuation of an exploration of structures
that have a role in their own making, it is a simple system whose final
form is only semi-determined.

The exhibition opens June 4th from 2 - 5pm and remains onview through
the summer.  See the attached website for directions and hours

Socrates Sculpture Park is a 4.5 acre, waterfront sculpture park located on 
the East River in Long Island City, Queens. Socrates Sculpture Park is one of 
the few places In New York City where large-scale, outdoor sculpture can be 
enjoyed by the public. Since its opening In the fall of 1986 the Park has 
presented a constantly changing selection of work by the most exciting 
artists working today. Sculptors from all regions of the United States, 
Europe and Central America have been joined by musicians, dancers, painters 
and filmmakers to create a multi-media modern art showcase. 

Socrates Sculpture Park is situated In Long Island City, Queens, where 
private homes, factories and warehouses co-exist in an unpretentious 
neighborhood with breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. Appropriately, 
the park is located on the border of the largest population of Greeks outside 
Athens. 

Located at Vernon Boulevard and Broadway in Long Island City

History and Goals of Socrates Sculpture Park 

Socrates Sculpture Park Is a former illegal dumpsite leased from New York 
City's Department of Ports and Trade for $1 per year. The site required 
almost a year of work to clear and landscape before the first installation of 
sculpture was possible. Socrates Sculpture Park is the masterwork of the 
Athena Foundation, which was created In 1977 by the sculptor Mark di Suvero 
to encourage the arts, to expand the culture and to create a space for the 
harmonious interaction of people and art. 

After a year of clearing what was once an illegal garbage dump, the Park 
opened its first exhibition of contemporary, outdoor sculpture in 1986. Since 
that time, Socrates continues to revitalize the economic, social, 
educational, and cultural life of this community via activities that 
encourage creative interaction between artists, their art, and the community 
through visual arts and outreach programs. The Park's existence is based on 
the belief that reclamation, revitalization and creative expression are 
essential to the survival, humanity and improvement of our urban environment. 

At a ceremony on May 23,1993, Socrates officially became part of the NYC 
Dept. of Parks & Recreation. As the newest addition to Park land in over a 
decade SSP is the only NYC park dedicated solely to the creation & exhibition 
of contemporary sculpture. In 1995, Socrates was designated as one of sixty 
three "Great American Public Places," testimony to the fact that the Park is 
an exemplary model of the built environment. Although our new relationship 
with the City of NY guarantees our existence for years to come it does not 
provide support for our outreach programs for youth or community residents. 

Community Collaborations Initiative 

Since Its inception the Park has operated outreach programs for youth and 
neighborhood residents. In 1990 SSP founded the Education Department, 
offering a variety of innovative & alternative programs to some of NYC 
neediest youth from the local community, as well as off-site in NYC public 
schools. Many of our program target youth from high risk backgrounds. These 
workshops further the Park's goal to redefine the role of the art institution 
as a purveyor of alternative education in the schools, community and 
eventually society. 

Through our Community Collaborations Initiative, Socrates is able to design 
on a one-on-one basis special hands on art workshops. While many schools have 
lost funds for fine arts programs, Arts Education is now recognized as an 
essential part of healthy development and a rounded education.

Subject: Chiles/Seacor Smit Day Rate deal

Mark, 

Please prepare a term sheet which can be used as a Indicative Proposal for 
our potential first Day Rate transaction.  

The key issues other than call premium that need to be clarified are the 
"posting language" and the determination period.

We will (if we reach agreement) be purchasing a series of calls and Chiles 
Offshore LLC or Seacor Smit, Inc. (the entity which is currently the majority 
owner of Chiles Offshore, LLC - but after the Chiles IPO, their interest will 
be lowered to around 25%) will be selling the calls.

The Strike Price will be at a Day Rate of  US$70,000/day 

The volume will be One (1) Rig * Day (rig multiplied times day).

Determination Period:  Jan 1, 2001 through Mar 31, 2001 

Floating Price:  We need two sets of language here - to let the customer 
choose from.

 a.   The floating price will be the Median of the High/Low of Day Rates for 
Gulf Of Mexico, Jackups "Over 300' - C", as posted in the first printing of 
the month of the Offshore Data Services, Offshore Rig Locator, page entitled 
"Competitive Offshore Rig Day Rates",   (Mark, the day rates listed in the 
June 2000 posting will be applied to each day of the preceding month (May 
2000)).

or:

 b. The floating price will be the Median of the High/Low of the Day Rate 
Range ($) for the Rigtype listed as JU-Over 300'-IC as posted each Friday of 
the month.   (Mark, the price listed on Friday the 7th, will be for the first 
7 days of the month) 

I need to send this out Friday (tomorrow) afternoon.  As we discussed, we 
need to include language that identifies that this is not definitive and 
needs Enron Corp's board approval before becoming a deal.

I will carry a copy of the posting to your office before I leave this 
evening.  

John

1) Enron Net Work should probably be EnronOnline, LLC

2) 1. What is a Passport Application?

3) 3.  I agreed we wouldn't pass along any details of any bids to ENA 
employees. I don't know what all of this paragraph entails. Can you shed some 
light, or should we just ask them to reword it?

Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
redlined by hand. 

Thanks again for all your help.

Tony

Below please find the language that Mark & I propose for the EnronOnline 
Markets page as well as each commodity "home" page for the web site.  Please 
let us know if it looks like each such page is going to be limited in length 
so that it is not necessary to scroll down to see the entire page.

Your company should not enter into any transaction unless it fully 
understands the potential risks and rewards of that transaction and has 
independently determined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your 
company's objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and 
other relevant circumstances.  Please bear in mind that in providing this web 
site, Enron is acting as a potential arm's length counterparty and not as 
your company's adviser.  For further information, please see Legal and 
Privacy Information [link]

Let us know if this disclaimer language will work.

copy of her "project list" so that we can follow up on 
finalizing/redistributing her workload?  I have lots of questions which I'm 
sure can't be answered this minute, such as:  Shouldn't we help to prioritize 
her work?  Will she continue day-to-day work?  Who will take confirm desk 
calls?, How will this impact Samantha's training (maybe the lawyers should be 
involved now), etc.  

Please let us know when you'd like to "regroup".  Thanks.  Sara

Ken:

As we discussed this afternoon, I would appreciate your assistance in 
developing the basic guidelines for EnronOnline Phase II content.  
Specifically, I would appreciate the following:

1.  Please send me a copy of the CFTC no action letter that we discussed last 
week.

2.  Please prepare a memorandum outlining the issues to be addressed in 
reviewing internally-generated content, e.g. (a) CTA concerns; (b) general 
advisor issues; (c) other general resposibilities of a publisher, such as 
truth, accuracy.  (As I mentioned, I think it would be helpful to have some 
general insights from someone with a publishing background.)  Additionally, 
are there any particular issues to be addressed with regard to content 
generated by an outside consultant like Cynthia Case who prepares a case 
study for EnronOnline containing generic advise and who also provides 
advisory services to third parties.  

As you requested, I am faxing to you a few examples of content that has been 
developed for Phase II to date.  If you run into any red flags, please let me 
know at your earliest opportunity.  Time is of the essence, and the text that 
I am sending you has already gone out to the site developer for html 
formatting.

3.  Please review the current Legal and Privacy Information I am forwarding 
to you and revise to incorporate necessary modifications and/or additions.

4.  Mark and I have discussed the issue of appropriate disclaimers in some 
length.  Currently, the Legal and Privacy Information link is discretely 
tucked beside the copyright notice on the home page.  We have asked that the 
home page instead include an addition at the bottom of the text referencing 
Legal and Privacy Information:  "Please see Legal and Privacy Information 
[link] for terms governing your use of the web site."  

The home page links to a page entitled "EnronOnline Markets", which links to 
various commodity "home" pages.  On each of the EnronOnline Markets and 
commodity pages, we would like to add the following text as well:  "Your 
company should not enter into any transaction unless it fully understands the 
potential risks and rewards of that transaction and has independently 
determined that the transaction is appropriate in light of your company's 
objectives, experience, financial and operational resources, and other 
relevant circumstances.  Please bear in mind that in providing this web site, 
Enron is acting as a potential arm's length counterparty and not as your 
company's adviser.  For further information, please see Legal and Privacy 
Information [link]."

These additions to the site are pending EnronOnline approval, but I would 
welcome any general thoughts you may have.

I am receiving 2-5 pieces of content for review, and after my review, each 
piece of content is forwarding to the site developer for formatting.  As you 
can appreciate, timing is critical so that we can minimize the required 
reformatting.

Thank you so much for your assistance!

Tana, Enron Canada is currently negotiating a transaction with 6 major 
municipalities in Ontario (the "G6") to provide various services to a company 
those 6 entities are setting up, which services will include physical and 
financial trading (both gas and electricity).  John Suttle is working with 
Jan Wilson of our Toronto office to set the credit terms applicable to this 
entity on both the physical and financial trading side, but they have not yet 
made a final determination.  In the interim, the G6 has requested that we 
send them a copy of our precedent form of master financial trading agreement 
(both the ISDA and our short form financial GTC).  I assume you get requests 
like this all the time and was hoping that you could e-mail to me (i) the 
ISDA, credit support annex, Paragraph 13, etc. that we would typically put in 
place between ECC and a Canadian counterparty to financially trade gas and 
electricity in Canada (ie. incorporating the Canadian provisions), leaving 
the credit terms blank for the time being and (ii) the financial GTC we use 
for Canadian counterparties.

Call me if you have any questions or if there are any problems with preparing 
and forwarding these documents to the counterparty.

Thanks

Greg

Gary

There follows a summary of the key information required in order to be able 
to estimate, under SFA capital rules, the likely regulatory capital 
requirements of the proposed bond and equity trading businesses in London.  
The summary has been prepared by Andy Cornfield who is our resident expert on 
the SFA's capital rules.

As previously discussed, EEFT - our SFA regulated agent through which we 
currently propose to run this business - is subject only to very modest 
regulatory capital rules since it does not take any principal positions.  Our 
view, however, is that a bond and equity trading desk of the type discussed 
will (sooner or later) become subject to SFA capital requirements and so it 
makes sense now to estimate the likely extent of that capital.

It would be very helpful at this stage if you (or someone in your group) 
could provide a guestimate (based on the US model, but modified where you 
think the European positions might be different) of the likely volumes and 
constituent parts of these businesses:

after 12 months of trading 
after 24 months of trading
after 36 months of trading

Please contact Andy or myself if you would like to discuss this. I look 
forward to hearing from you.

Best regards

Paul

Robert,

Please be advised that Japan already has ETA's and PA's.

It costs approx. GBP 15,000 to add each new country. Please let us know which 
ones you are happy to have charged to your RC and we'll commence legal due 
diligence on any you specify.

Dave

Subject: freight derivatives - EOL

I have trawled through the list of jurisdictions of potential counterparties 
to the freight swaps/options.

A list
Norway
Denmark
Germany
Switzerland
UK
Belgium
France 
Netherlands
Singapore 
Australia

We have already done full EOL due diligence on the above jurisdictions. The 
only issue which we wd just need to cover is whether for regulatory purposes 
freight is treated as a commodity. We shd be able to get answers on that 
issue quickly. 

B list
Turkey
Taiwan
Japan
Argentina
Israel
Gibraltar
S. Korea

We do not have much on the above jurisdictions here although Mark T may have 
done some due diligence on the non- European, non-middle eastern countries. 
Do you want us to undertake full due diligence on these?

C list
Liberia
Panama
Cayman Isl
BVI
Bermuda
Bahamas
BWI

I understand that decisions may have already been made not to include 
entities incorporated into these jurisdictions, because of money laundering 
issues, lack of corporate transparency etc. Cd this be confirmed. 

Many thanks

Robert

Vanguard Files To Offer Exchange-Traded Shares For Five Index Funds

05/12/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Mutual-fund giant Vanguard Group is seeking regulatory 
permission to offfer a new type
of share class for five of its nine stock-index funds that would act like 
exchange-traded funds. 

Vanguard, which has thrived for years by offering low-cost stock funds, said 
the share class, called "Viper" shares
for Vanguard Index Participation Equity Receipts, will be listed on the 
American Stock Exchange. The funds which
filed to register a Viper class of exchange-traded shares are Vanguard 500 
Index Fund, Vanguard Growth Index
Fund, Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, Vanguard Value Index Fund and 
Vanguard Small-Cap Index
Fund.

Index mutual funds, traditionally the lowest cost provider of mutual fund 
portfolios, are being challenged by
exchange-traded funds, which are mutual-fund-like vehicles that trade over an 
exchange like a stock.
Exchange-traded funds cost less than index funds because the asset-management 
firms that sponsor them don't
deal directly with the individual investor through expensive telephone 
centers and retail offices. 

The Viper shares differ from conventional mutual fund shares in that they 
trade continuously at market prices on the
American Stock Exchange rather than the calculated net asset value of the 
fund determined at the end of the
trading day. Given this flexibility, Vipers shares are expected to appeal 
primarily to short-term investors. Vanguard
has yet to determine the expense ratios for the Viper shares. 

The move by Vanguard, the second largest mutual fund company, comes amid 
heightened competition in the
marketplace for index investors. Barclays Global Investors, a huge presence 
in the pension-investing world. is
preparing over the next four weeks to unveil 28 new index funds that will 
also trade on the American Stock
Exchange. The exchange-traded funds will track everything from the total U.S. 
stock market to industrial and
Internet sectors. 

The flagship Barclays product, iShares S&P 500 Fund, will mirror the 
big-company Standard & Poor's 500-stock
Index and will have an annual expense ratio of 0.08% to 0.10% of assets, 
people familiar with the situation told The
Wall Street Journal. That's about half the price currently paid by investors 
in the $105 billion Vanguard 500 Index
Fund.

Daily Update -- McGraw-Hill Sues Vanguard Over Planned Vipers Funds

06/08/2000
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Dow Jones Interactive
Financial Services Update
For June 8, 2000
Today's top stories as of 4 p.m. EDT:

- McGraw-Hill Cos., on behalf of its Standard & Poor's Corp. unit, has filed 
a lawsuit in federal court charging the
Vanguard Group Inc. with breach of contract and trademark infringement in 
connection with the mutual fund
company's proposed new Vipers exchange-traded funds, or ETFs. 

McGraw-Hill's suit alleges Vanguard breached the companies' 1988 license 
agreement by using Standard & Poor's
proprietary indices and trademarks for the Vipers exchange-traded products 
without permission. 

Officials from Vanguard, the nation's second largest fund firm, weren't 
immediately available to comment on the
lawsuit. 

Exchange-traded funds are a hybrid version of index mutual funds that can be 
bought or sold during the day at
market prices instead of at the once-daily 4 p.m. price used by traditional 
mutual funds. ETFs are single shares of
stock that replicate an index such as the Standard & Poor's 500. 

Standard & Poor's currently has more than 400 license agreements for uses of 
its indices and trademarks, including
agreements related to ETFs, according to McGraw-Hill. 

McGraw-Hill wants to prevent Vanguard from using S&P's indices and trademarks 
in connection with Vipers or any
other exchange-traded security. The complaint also seeks an order requiring 
Vanguard to withdraw its Securities
and Exchange Commission application for Vipers, and seeks an order declaring 
Vanguard liable for unspecified
damages and attorneys' fees. 

- Liberty Financial Cos. confirmed it is in talks to acquire Wanger Asset 
Management L.P., which operates the
Acorn mutual funds. 

The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that Liberty (L), a Boston-based 
asset-management company, would pay
about $450 million for Wanger, a Chicago investment company that has been on 
the SELLING block for several
months. 

The Journal said the reported price of the transaction, which equals about 6% 
of Wanger's $7.3 billion of assets
under management, would be considered a healthy one for a mutual-fund company 
and follows a recent trend of
well-priced deals. Pioneer Investment Management was bought last month for 
$1.2 billion, about 5% of assets, even
as the firm's management was being sharply criticized by shareholders and its 
funds were suffering big withdrawals.

The typical price for a fund firm had been about 3% of assets, depending on 
how the assets were invested. Wanger
was considered attractive because most of its assets are in highly profitable 
stock mutual funds. 

Liberty, majority owned by Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., has about $67 
billion in assets and 95 mutual funds. 

- Midwest bank National City Corp. will sell about $2 billion in student 
loans as part of a restructuring of its balance
sheet. The company said the sale, expected to close in the second quarter, 
will result in a pretax gain of about $75
million. 

In addition to the student loan sale, National City is also evaluating other 
alternatives. Some would require the
recognition of losses, given current market conditions. 

Cleveland-based National City (NCC) reported a decline in first quarter net 
income as borrowing costs rose more
than loan rates. Last November the bank warned analysts to reduce profit 
estimates as the spread between its
borrowing costs and lending rates shrank. The problem for National City and 
many banks is the failure of deposit
growth to keep pace with loan demand. That forces them to fund loans with 
money borrowed at higher rates in the
capital markets. 

National City expects its balance sheet reorganization to be complete by the 
end of the third quarter. 

- Led by a fall in the typical interest rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage, 
rates declined in a weekly survey from
Freddie Mac. 

The mortgage buyer (FRE) said the average rate lenders were seeking on a 
fixed, 30-year mortgage fell to 8.32% for
the week that ends Friday. That is down from 8.54% last week. 

The average rate for a fixed, 15-year mortgage was 8.04%, down from 8.24%. 
The rate for one-year, adjustable rate
mortgages, or ARMs, slipped to 7.24% from last week's 7.25%, which was the 
highest since April of 1991. 

The Freddie Mac survey appears to confirm that mortgage rates, which rose to 
their highest level in five years in
May, may have eased a bit. 

HSH Associates, a Butler, N.J. financial publisher, said the average rate for 
a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to
8.4%, down from a high of 8.79% for the week ended May 19. 

"I wouldn't call it a rally, but we are getting some relief," Keith 
Gumbinger, an analyst at HSH told The Wall Street
Journal. 

Recent economic data - including a Labor Department report last week showing 
a rise in the unemployment rate -
suggest the economy is cooling. That has calmed fears about inflation, 
sending interest rates for Treasury bonds
and mortgage-backed securities - which mortgages follow - lower.
