Can we talk about what we want to pay for this capacity?  PSEG has released 
at $0.16 and $0.15.  Con Ed has released at $0.14.  Do we want to pay those 
prices?  Con Ed will do prearranged non-biddable with us at $0.15 (maybe 
$0.14).

Thanks,
Maureen

Scott & Chris-

This is mainly just an FYI so everyone has all the same information.  Earlier 
today I had lunch with Ken Capp and Mike from CNG Sabine and they brought up 
the point that Enron is the only customer that is not using Sabine any 
longer.  Most of their customers are using a combination of Sabine (IHT 
Contracts) and CNG Transmission (TTT Contracts) for their daily business.    
Ken is concerned about losing Enron as a customer since in the past we did a 
lot of business through them.  Ken is now interested in doing some 
negotiating.  As of today, CNG Transmission will not be charging any fees 
until October at the earliest- if ever- for the service they are providing, 
but after October, the fee could be up to 84 cents per transaction, applied 
to the seller only.  Ken said that he would be willing to talk about lowering 
his rates for Enron if that's what it would take to bring us back into their 
customer list.  Of course, this is an exception to what they do for their 
other customers, so Ken is requesting that we keep this negotiation process 
confidential in the best interests of both parties.    If you have any other 
questions about this conversation, please let me know. 

Scott-  Ken's number is 713-752-4018, in case you don't have it.   

Just as a side note:  Ken also mentioned that they are looking into providing 
a hub service for Transco right now.

 Thanks!  -Angie

We parked 25,000 dt/day on the 25th-27th (deal 225515) on CNG and we will be 
taking it out during April (deal 225534).  ENA will pay CNG $.02 x 75,000 dt 
= $1,500.00 in April.

Angie/Chris

Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 
were cut 364 MMBtu's (from 24,502 to 24,138) @ Canajoharie on the evening 
cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 
trickle down, i.e. Beth @ CNG notified Iroquois on 07/26, & Iroquois notified 
us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 
11,284 MMBtu's @ $0.0154 = $173.77).  Per Angie's previous e:mail on this 
item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
Verification at present.  

Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

Brad-

I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie

FYI  --  Press Release received this morning:

Cove Point LNG to Begin Open Season Process For Capacity at its LNG Receiving 
Terminal 
? 
02/16/2000 
PR Newswire 
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire) 

HERNDON, Va, Feb. 16 /PRNewswire/ -- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a 
subsidiary of Columbia Energy Group, announced today that it will conduct an 
open season from February 16 to March 16, 2000, for a firm LNG tanker 
discharging service at its Cove Point LNG terminal. The new service will 
include the unloading of LNG from tankers, LNG storage, vaporization, and 
delivery of natural gas to points along Cove Point's existing pipeline.   

Cove Point LNG is offering 750,000 dekatherms per day of deliverability and 
4.25 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of vapor equivalent storage capacity initially. 
The service includes a proposed expansion of the available storage capacity 
to 6.75 Bcf approximately one year after the start-up of the LNG receiving 
operations. Pending approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 
Cove Point LNG plans to begin the LNG tanker discharging service by late 
2001. 

Located in Lusby, Md., the Cove Point LNG terminal includes liquefied natural 
gas storage and terminal operations, and an 87-mile natural gas pipeline that 
connects with gas pipelines in Northern Virginia. The terminal has installed 
send-out capacity of 1 Bcf of gas per day. With the proposed storage 
expansion, total LNG storage at Cove Point will be 7.5 Bcf of vapor 
equivalent natural gas. The Cove Point LNG terminal currently provides "peak 
shaving" services to customers in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions.  

Columbia Energy Group, based in Herndon, Va., is one of the nation's leading 
energy services companies, with assets of approximately $7 billion. Its 
operating companies engage in virtually all phases of the natural gas 
business, including exploration and production, transmission, storage and 
distribution, as well as retail energy marketing, propane and petroleum 
product sales, and electric power generation. Information about Columbia 
Energy Group (NYSE: CG) is available on the Internet at 
www.columbiaenergygroup.com.   

This press release contains "forward looking statements" within the meaning 
of the Federal securities laws, including statements concerning, on a 
consolidated, segment or subsidiary basis, Columbia's plans, objectives and 
expected performance. There can be no assurance that actual results will not 
differ materially due to various factors, many of which are beyond the 
control of Columbia, including, but not limited to, the regulatory approval 
process, competition, weather, supply and demand for natural gas, and changes 
in general economic conditions.

I thought you all may be interested in a summary of the FERC Conference I 
attended on Tuesday.  The comments below are from Becky Cantrell and Shelley 
Corman.  I will also forward the comments from our Washington attorney, who 
also attended the conference.  We have 30 days to file comments on the 
meeting.  There are a couple of issues I want to discuss with you that will 
help us decide whether we should file certain comments.  I will arrange a 
meeting soon.

Subject: Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today

I generally concur with Shelley's summary.    On the fourth bullet in the 
first section (tighter tolerances), a lot of parties (more than I expected) 
kvetched about the fact that pipelines seemed to be using the Order 637 
filings to make their penalty provisions even worse -- higher fees, tighter 
tolerances -- and then proposing new default or mandatory services that 
looked a lot like penalties.  

There was the usual affiliate bashing, particularly on the 
shipper-must-have-title rule discussions.  Southern Company also brought it 
up in connection with LNG import facilities, e.g., Cove Point and Elba 
Island.  It seems pretty clear that the January conference, which is to 
address marketing affiliates, will be pretty heated.  Based on their comments 
in this conference, I expect BP/Amoco is going to be particularly aggressive 
(rabid, even), and Dynegy will almost certainly be chiming in.  We need to 
start developing a strategy to counter some of their most virulent arguments.

Subject: Memo from Shelley Corman: FERC Staff Conference Today

Today, FERC Staff held its conference to discuss what regulatory changes are 
necessary to promote further market liquidity.  The conference was fairly 
well attended by FERC staff, including Dan Larcamp and  Shelton Cannon.  

Some common themes:
Gas markets are generally well functioning and major changes are not 
necessary.
Commodity markets are very liquid.
FERC policies, GISB and Order 637 have helped to make capacity markets more 
liquid.
Shippers are unhappy with tighter tolerances and new balancing services in 
Order No. 637 compliance filings.
Standardization is necessary to promote liquidity (with pipelines making the 
distinction that standardization of transactional protocols is a good idea, 
standardization of product offerings is not).
There is very little consensus on further areas for change.  In nearly every 
case, a change advocated by one shipper group is opposed by another.  
In any event, most said that now is not the time for sweeping changes.

Areas without consensus:
Shipper-must-have-title rule.  LDCs argue it should be removed; while Process 
Gas and producers think that removal will undermine the capacity release 
market.
Production area rate design.  LDCs argued that they need the ability to buy 
service downstrream of a market pool.  Reliant and Koch also argued that 
pipelines should have to have separately stated production and market rates.  
The producers opposed any attempt to shift costs to the production area.
SFV.  East Coast LDCs, Michcon, and APGA argued for moving off of SFV.  The 
producers and industrials oppose.  Illinois Power/Dynegy also argued for 
moving off SFV.  


LDC Positions
The LDCs main themes were removing the shipper-must-have-title and enabling 
LDCs to hold space downstream of market centers.  However, they also argued 
that  pipelines should not be permitted to offer new services to the electric 
generation market that reduce the flexibilities LDCs have historically 
enjoyed since the system was built for LDCs .   This is the point that AGA 
raised in the blanket intervention to all Order 637 compliance filings.    
Carl Levander of Columbia did a nice job of refuting the notion that LDCs are 
entitled to unwritten flexibility that they have enjoyed in the past on a 
best efforts basis, perhaps in part due to the fact that the pipeline may not 
have been fully subscribed.  LDCs, generally stating that 637 compliance 
filings did a poor job of allowing capacity segmentation, continued to stress 
the need for segmentation, including "geographical segmentation of ROFR 
capacity."  

Some Specific Proposals
NGSA called for more targeted information to be included in Form 2 filings.  
A number of customer groups noted the need for more and better information, 
though specific needs were not well defined.
Several parties ask FERC to reconsider national standardized penalties 
(especially given expected high prices this winter and the possibility for 
arbitrage).
Alliance of Energy Suppliers (marketing arm of EEI) called for a dialogue 
between power generators and INGAA to develop a new firm tariff with hourly 
variability.  They also called for a change in GISB nomination deadlines to 
match the power grid (Dan Larcamp asked whether EEI is open to efforts to 
standardize scheduling times across the power grid as well).
The GISB End-User group (represented by Salt River Project)  complained about 
the need to standardize the confirmation process and called for gas 
transactions to be "tagged" like electric transactions.  

E-Commerce and Capacity Trading
Dave Neubaurer did a great job of driving home the themes that capacity 
trading can occur if FERC and industry are willing to allow more speedy 
transactions, remove posting periods and long contract execution periods.  He 
made an effective case that no major regulatory changes are necessary.  
Robert Levin of the NY Mercantile Exchange echoed this theme, admonishing the 
FERC not to micro-manage the types of trading platforms or to try to insist 
on a single platform.  He said that liquidity cannot be legislated.  From his 
perspective, natural gas markets are the best functioning commodity markets 
in the world.  FERC should worry about transferring the "good stuff" from 
natural gas to electric markets, not the reverse.

It seems like we should unless there is any outstanding business that still 
needs to be resolved before we do this.....

I just noticed that ENA is still agent for CES and CEM on Transco.  If we no 
longer have a need to be agent, I think we should terminate those agencies.  
What do you think?

Were we given a different demand charge from CES than what the contract 
actually is, or was this our error?  Is this contract passed through and 
payable by Devon or are we at risk?  Please advise.

I will be emailing all of you with any capacity issues I find.

CGLF k#64502 ;  This is an offshore FTS2 contract that we use with the West 
Cam Devon production.  The demand charge is $1.4381 on a volume of 29,000 dts 
and the commodity is $.0024.  According to my notes; this is a volumetric 
demand contract and the volumetric demand charge in my sheet is $.0648

I am changing this to a regular demand charge contract in Sitara and the 
worksheet.

I talked to John Singer this morning, who was been working with Jim Javins on 
the applachian supply process. They are putting a proposal together on how 
the back office should be handled. The proposal should be done early next 
week and he will fax me a copy.  I will hold off on researching this matter 
right now, until the proposal is done. Thanks.

Subject: Appalachian Supply

I'm sure that most of you have recently heard some discussions on how to best 
get our hands around the Appalachian supply and bring that into
the Enron business.  So, I wanted to update you on the direction I'm 
currently taking.  I have asked Joanie Veselack to do a bit of research.  She 
is
going to be talking to John Singer, Jill Linkenauger, Kim Cottle, and 
whomever else she may feel appropriate including some of our own in house 
support people to get a feel for what they do in relation to the supply and 
what all is going to be required to bring that into our own systems properly.
Once she gathers this information, we will be holding a meeting, hopefully 
next week, to develop a plan of action and to identify any further support 
needs that we might have.  I'll keep you posted as to our progress.

Thanks!

PPL Energy Plus II     30,000  10  Princeton Junction $0.18

 Phase 1 begins 11/1/01.  Phase II begins 11/1/02.  The rates shown are for 
the demand and are the rates that Transco had been marketing for the 
project.  Each shipper is responsible for fuel and the electric power 
commodity charge and ACA.  There will be no GRI or Great Plains commodity 
surcharges.  The Manhattan and PSEG delivery points are Transco Zone 6 NY 
points.  The Camden, Trenton-Woodbury and Princeton Junction points are 
non-NY.
 Williams reduced their precedent agreement volume from 210,000 Dthd to the 
100,000 Dthd.  Williams' rights to PSEG points are north of the Linden 
allocation point.  Virginia Power is buying a project from Statoil on the 
Trenton-Woodbury line.  Virginia Power's commitment to MarketLink replaces 
one of Statoil's two precedent agreements.  Statoil has also sold another 
project that was underlying their second precedent agreement.  The new and 
unnamed project owner has requested and been granted an extension to the 
90,000 Dthd precedent agreement for a later phase of MarketLink.  Sunset 
Energy Fleet has requested and been granted an extension for their 95,600 
Dthd precedent agreeement.  LFG, a landfill gas developer, has also been 
granted an extension of their 5,000 Dthd precedent agreement to enable LFG to 
finalize a sale with a new owner or to locate an alternative landfill site.  
PPL Energy Plus has the right to deliver into a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL Interstate Energy Company pipeline system in Lower Mt. Bethel 
Township, Northampton County, Pennsylvania or a proposed new interconnect 
with PPL's Eden plant in East Drumore Township, Lancaster County, 
Pennsylvania on a primary basis.  They also have the right to extend their 
agreement at the $0.18 rate for an additional two five year terms.  Dynegy 
(30,000 Dthd) and Engage (210,000 Dthd) terminated their respective precedent 
agreements.  Due to these terminations and reductions,  Transco only has 
announced precedent agreements of 190,600 Dthd for later phases.  If these 
precedent agreements become contracts, MarketLink would have 486,600 Dthd of 
shipper volume.  Transco has stated that all 700,000 Dthd of MarketLink would 
be built by 11/01/04.

Dan and I spoke with Jim Eckert at Tenn - VNG is his customer.  Following are 
the MDQ's and rates on the Tennessee contracts effective 11/1/2000


Contract MDQ  Delivery Point Demand Comm  Comment
47  16,373  S Webster $6.0800  $.0500  Demand is $6.08 for daily volumes 
below 4,723 per day. 
          Demand goes to $7.61 for daily volumes above 4,723 per day.

21881  4,599  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below

21882  518  S Webster $7.61  $.0500  See below


Comments:
If we flow to any points other than the primary delivery point, the demand 
charge goes to max rate which is about $9.80.  

Questions for Tennessee;
What are the rates for October?
Do the differences in demand and commodity apply to daily quantities or 
monthly quantities?

Chris,

Operational note on DPL Columbia Gas SST contract for April:

The total contract volume will decrease from 241,000 to 120,000 on April 
1st.  By the terms of the deal, Dayton will take what they need on a daily 
basis and Enron will have the remainder of the contract MDQ.

Assuming normal system demand at DPL, Enron should have from 70,000 to 95,000 
of this SST contract during the month of April.

ECONOMIC NOTE:

Enron will not have to pay any variable cost (demand or commodity) to Dayton 
until the cumulative usage of the SST contract by DPL and Enron reaches 
9,239,520 /dth.  Based on the historical data compiled by Columbia during the 
course of the asset management deal, this 9.2 dth figure  will not be hit 
until sometime in June or early July.

It is to our advantage to fill this contract up to the max. allowed by DPL on 
a daily basis until this 9.2 figure comes into play.   It is an immediate 
saving of the commodity charge, which will be about $0.015.

I can provide a copy of the actual contract for your review upon request.

Mark - below is TGT's offer for a 1, 3, and 5 year deal.  Please note that 
the (crappy) quote below does not include a fuel adder.   Fuel is approx. 
3.4% in the winter and 2.7% in the summer.  You will probably get a better 
quote from the desk.  My guess is they will offer something in the area of I 
plus $0.28 or $0.29, but you'll need to get a quote from them directly.

Chris:

Sorry for the delay in this response things have been crazy.  Outlined below
is a quote for pricing from TGT Zone SL to Zone 4 with the various terms you
requested.  Keep in mind that this capacity is subject to the bidding
process and this is simply a proposal based on capacity available to date.
The proposed rates are as follows:

  Demand Charges per MMBtu
Term  Summer Winter
1 Year $.21  Max Rates which are currently $.3074
3 Years $.20  Max Rates which are  currently $.3074
5 Years $.19  Max Rates which are currently $.3074

The rates above do not reflect the currently filed commodity charge of $.0417
and do not include the applicable fuel retention.  The max rates listed for
service in the winter will be adjusted according to the currently filed max
rates at the time service is rendered.

65534 is 149349 in Sitara
 65403 was 149346 as ENA agent for CES.  I created deal 214854 for April 1 
forward, since Joann has pathed it for March.
 The demand was not correct on the first so I fixed it also.
I will update the sheet when you exit the original.

Subject: Iroquios - Model Type Change Needed  

In order to prepare for EDI, I have reviewed the February invoice from 
Iroquios and determined that this contract (125099) is indeed billed as the 
pipeline stated - a non-pathed service.

Sylvia, please modify similar to National fuels by creating a new service 
type - "Park and Loan - Non Pathed" to be effective 6-1-00.  Are there any 
others? Please notify the above when done.

Chris, will you set up a new deal ticket on this new service in Sitara when 
available and notify Angie?  Terminate the old deal ticket effective 5-31-00

Angie, it  appears you are already pathing this contract correctly, it will 
be necessary to select the correct service from the service list for June 1st 
nominations.  There are some other contracts that I believe we need to change 
the pathing methodology on in the near future.

Richard,

Could you look at the invoice and verify that the park & loan service is 
really non-pathed for Iroquis contract 125099.

Unify has contract 125099 as pathed.  The pipe says they are non-pathed on 
this service.

If this needs to be changed, could you get Global to add this, and let the 
Scheduler know about the nom basis/model type addition.  The Scheduler's are 
Molly LaFuze and Victor LaMadrid.

Thanks, Diane

TCO decided to reverse the penalties Enron incurred in January and February. 
The credit is on the TCO's invoice for April.

January = $13,424
February = $13,775

Total Credit = $27,199

TCO Team discussed this penalty situation with TCO's VP, Marsall Lang. TCO 
decided that Enron had not abused the system and did not overrun the TFE 
(Total Firm Entitlement). YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Subject: CALP & GELP

We now have paper for CALP (Commonwealth Atlantic Limited Partnership) and 
GELP?? (Gordonsville Energy, L.P.).  I believe what I have is the original 
contract between CES and these 2 counterparties and the "consent to waive the 
confidentiality" letter.  I don't see anything that looks like an assignment 
of the contract to ENA.  Robin and I discovered today that ENA will be 
responsible for negotiating the transport agreement on behalf of CALP for the 
next year starting 7/8/2000.

Also, neither counterparty appears to have been set up in Sitara.  Do these 
counterparties need to be set up in Sitara?

Mr. Mills, all I care about at this point is getting the CALP transport 
contract set up in Sitara.  Joan Veselack will get Scott Goodell to find out 
exactly who receives the bills on this 40,000/day OPT-60 transport 
agreement.  Scott will forward that information to you and everyone else on 
this email.  I welcome your suggestions.

Paper:  I made copies for Robin Barbe, Stephanie Sever, and Sylvia Campos.  
Sylvia, I left your copies with Brenda Fletcher - I don't know where you sit.

To ensure everyone is on the same page for maximum dispatch.

80,000 for Hopewell Dispatch:

10,000 nom'd on Secondary FTS TCO contract. Secondary nominated to reserve 
place in the queue
20,000 Hopewell Transport (idle right now, if TCO constrains, will need 
inground storage transfer with CGV)
7,000  Leach to Richmond Transport (pending release)
30,000 to 50,000 Dayton Transport (secondary transport, depends on available 
capacity from Dayton, and if TCO lets it flow)

67,000 to 87,000 Possible TCO transport.

We should get an IT discount rate on TCO (CES had 1.5 to 3.5 discount rate 
last summer). We had to use IT several times last summer.


40,000 for Calp Dispatch:

40,000 Calp Transport 
May need Broadrun gas, if TCO contrains. John Hodge is talking to Brian Adams 
at TCO to have Leach as receipt point before July 7th.


Like Joann says below, we will need a game plan and especially one for the 
weekends. Every Friday afternoon, we will meet with Robin/Dick to clarify TCO 
transport availabilty, TCO flow constraints, and supply sources to meet this 
maximum dispatch load.

Thanks for everyone's help in getting the Cogen's 
running!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Robin, to keep everyone updated for April 2000 I have baseload 10,000dth on a 
secondary contract just for TCO's queue process.  As you know we have a  SST 
contract{k66965} primary for Hopewell of 20,000dth which I have no volumes on 
as of now.  I will do a retro each day to match Hopewell's burn.  Calp has 
the 40,000dth Broadrun to Calp again I have no volumes on it.

If Hopewell dispatch more then 30,000 a day i have no capacity.  whats the 
game plan???


thanks

It depends when we pay the fee, but if it is on the way out we would just 
make the commodity fee .04 cents.

These numbers will change a little but this is what we currently have in the

Parking in May  55,150 dth/total (deal 281565)
Taking out in June 1,837 dth/day  (deal 281556)

I'm not sure if the May numbers are net of fuel and we don't have an exact 
parking number for today as well.

David, where do I show the $.04 parking fee.  We are paying $.04 times the 
total volume parked, not the daily balance.

Answers to your quetions:
Yes; no; maybe

Just kidding....
Interconnects for Calp and Dayton handled the same...just add those meters to 
the sell tkts to CES and the buys are the delivery points.  Don't path the 
actual contract in Unify...When we hold that capacity and EDI, we'll path in 
Unify.... We don't get the bills from TCO  in January for that contract.  Get 
em in February (when we hold the capacity).  They are set up in Unify but we 
won't actually use....We are providing that service for those guys.

Try  your best for trueing up the transport tkts and the CALP and Dayton tkts 
in Sitara.  Impact is on P and L for the desk daily and later on for the 
(O/A) operational analysis where the accountants compare what we estimated 
our costs and revenues for the desk were and what they actually came in 
at.......We know January will be messy...

Go ahead and true up the PAL agreement to match physical flow......

BUY/SELLS with ENA and CES.  We talked at the beginning of the month about 
this.  Sales/buys  to/from ENA on the CES reports and sales/buys to/from CES 
on the ENA facilitation by location reports should just be pahted as 
buy/sells.  (hopefully should be done already......)

I have a meeting from 3-4 today...other than that I'll be downstairs with 
y'all to answer any questions....

THANKS!!!!

Subject: Re: Dayton Stuff & Calp & other fun stuff  

You were a busy little bee last night!!!! Thanks for the help.

FSS 63304 - we are not using. I'll ask John Hodge what this storage had been 
used for in the past.

Clarification needed for the Dayton and Calp sell at the pool. How is the 
interconnect gas supply done... we had some on Calp with Virginia Power and 
Coral. In the past we have some on Dayton... don't think we have any in 
January yet. Does this through another monkey wrench into the works?

We will probably have to run some report out of navigator to true-up 
transport tickets. There are a ton of cuts lately and Joann receives daily 
request from CES retail for volume changes. Not sure the best, efficient way 
to maintain these tickets daily.

PAL for CES was physically flowed on January 1. Should we change the tickets 
to match physical flow???

I'm bummed about the storage ticket change again... but will redo the paths. 
This will be a couple hours of rework for me... not sure about Joann.

You have lost me on the ENA to CES and CES to ENA buy sell tickets. Can't 
think of any examples yet. Hope this doesn't cause repathing.

Subject: Dayton Stuff & Calp & other fun stuff

Hello my favorite TCO people:  Here's what we here at team TCO have done so 
far....Let's recap shall we..........

Dayton and Calp get the invoices from the p/l and we re-imburse them for the 
transport differenentials so......

Dayton capacity buy at the citygate = Sitara #151878 - path as buy/sell with 
your markets.
Dayton capacity sell at the pool = Sitara #151877 - path as buy sell from 
pool.  These 2 tkts  should be released  by Stephanie tomorrow morning.  True 
these up as best you can daily.
  
Also:
Calp capacity buy at the citygate = Sitara #149776 - path as buy/sell wth 
your markets.
Calp capacity sell at the pool = Sitara #149775 - path as buy/sell at pool.  
These 2 tkts should be released by Stephanie tomorrow morning.  True these up 
as best you can daily.

Our transport tkts from pool to city gate for all other transport still 
remains Sitara# 95448 and Sitara# 95449.   Please true up as best you can.

NEXT:
Do ya'll have 2 FSS Storages Contracts # 51407 and 63304?  

Deal # 151879 covers storage K# 63304 and deal # 151880 covers storage K# 
51407.  The Sitara gods have to approve, bounce the server and then it will 
appear in Unify for you to path....  

Deal # 149778 is the storage w/d ticket for both K# 63304 and K#51407.   Deal 
# 151882 is the storage injection ticket for the same.  The counterparty had 
to be changed back to CPR storage.  You guys have to unpath and re-path that 
piece showing the purchase from CES for the storage w/d.  Really SORRY about 
this!!!  Counterparty could not be CES --- We can't path on stg. contract and 
out of inventory and buy from CES at the same time w/o the point not being 
balanced. 

Park and Lend contract #64031 and # 64041 are being set up by Chris in Sitara 
but we have to get the Sitara gods to set up PAL contracts as ENA agency 
deals for CES so he can't put the deals in the system just yet.  They should 
be available tomorrow hopefully!!!!  They are for 250,000 on the first and 
the 300,000 on the second of January.  Path them accordingly depending on 
where that PAL gas went.

In addition all deals that are ENA to CES or CES to ENA should be pathed as 
buy/sells.

I think that is it for now.  Let me know if anything else stops you from 
pathing, running tracking and balancing and finally from bridging back the 
first  to Sitara. Let's set a GOAL to have the first totally pathed and 
tracked and balanced and bridged back and clean by close of business the 
19th. YEAH BABY!!!! 

By the way, we really appreciate the monumental effort you three have made in 
meeting all logistical requirements of the old and new TCO business and 
keeping track of the volumes in Sitara, Unify and Navigator...We're are 
zeroing in on end of month balance tie outs between Navigator and Sitara for 
the 4 CES pools and the 2 ENA pools.  We've kept a bunch of balls in the air 
for the last 4 weeks and to my knowledge haven't dropped one darn ball yet.   
Thanks.........

A quick summary of the Dominion Transmission Pool Operators Meeting:

1.  Two Pooling/Aggregations points:
  Appalachian Northpointe( Finnefrock & Misc) 
  Appalachian Southpointe (Bridgeport, Cornwell, Hastings & Misc)
2.  Two pool types:
   Transmission pool when the gas is delivered into a transmission line;
   Gathering pool when gas is delivered into gathering line.
3.  Pool operatores can do pool-to-pool tranfers between Transmission pools 
or between Gathering pools.  NO pool-to-pool transfers between a Transmission 
pool and a Gathering pool. 
4.  Pool-to-pool transfers will be allowed between North and South Points.  A 
transportation fee will be incurred. 
5..  Seperate agreements for Gathering (pooling & transport) and Transmission 
(pooling & transport) are needed.
6.. MARQ disappears Jan 1,2000.
7.  New "PROPOSED" gathering/extraction rates are:
 Gathering: $.3726 .
 Extraction:  $.3261.
 Fuel remains @ 2.28%
(IOGA WV is attempting to force Dominion into lowering these rates)
8.  Nominations for flowing gas moved back one business day.
9.  Appalachian Notices will be posted at www.dom.com

 I will bring the handouts with me  Bid week.  
John

Chris, we are not going to be able to repair this problem in the next few
days.  We need to do some programming work.  If you guys would go ahead and
pay the bill, it'll be washed out in an adjustment hopefully next month.
The bill itself is correct, it's just on the wrong contract.
Let me know if this is ok with you.   Thanks, ii

Depends on how the deals were entered originally.  If the sum of both deals 
will make up the total expense that will be paid to pipeline, then the 
waivers/discounts need to be included on both tickets.  If the tickets have 
been entered by some other method, a review might be necessary.  

Even though we know that we will pay the pipeline based on the net activity 
across all deals, each deal will be treated independently in Unify when 
determining the expense.  If two deals are entered assuming the tariff rate 
applies, then later one deal is modified to a negotiated price, only the 
volumes that are moved on the negotiated price deal will be valued this way, 
the volumes that move on the other ticket will still be valued at tariff rate.

Hope this helps.

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

Subject: Iroquois Gas

As noted in the Order 637 summary you received a couple of weeks ago, 
Iroquois Gas is proposing to limit overlapping nominations on segmented 
capacity.  Shippers will only be able to overlap segments to the extent the 
overlapped segment is within the path of both the releasing and replacement 
shipper.  Iroquois has made a number of arguments (some persuasive, some not) 
about why any other procedure is operationally infeasible.  For instance, 
they state that they would have to eliminate umbrella accounts because the 
process of reviewing contracts for interrelated releases would be too lengthy 
to complete within GISB timelines.

Is this issue of major concern to any of you in transacting daily business on 
Iroquois' system?  Have we tried to do any segmenting outside of the paths?

Please give me a call at X.35840 by Friday morning if we should file comments 
on this issue.  I did not see anything else of significance in their filing.

Thanks.

Hi All--

Attached is the Inside FERC summary of the FERC's order in the Transco 1Line / Order 637 proceeding and in the Texas Gas cash-out proceeding.

Transco is saying they won't implement "prior to April 1" but haven't decided on an implementation and training schedule as of yet. .The Order did not specify a date by which Transco had to implement.  Transco will have to make another filing to comply with this Order, so it may still be a little while before everything is finalized.  Given that the FERC did not speak to the cost of the system in this order (almost $80m), it's likely that the dollars will be subject to the on-going negotiations taking place in Transco's RP01-245 rate case proceeding.   I'll coordinate with Tammy to insure that we've got the necessary EDI testing plan in place and that we make the necessary Unify changes.

On Texas Gas, this represents a minor win for us--we had argued that Texas Gas' proposal was not consistent with Order 637 and that they should adopt a more "Transco-like" scheme that creates uncertainty w/o creating undue penalties.  Texas Gas will have to refile & we'll have another go-round between the marketing companies/producers and the LDC's on the Texas Gas system.  Will keep you posted.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

=============================================================================================================
TRANSCO GETS GREEN LIGHT TO IMPLEMENT 1LINE SYSTEM, OTHER RATE CHANGES

Capping a long-running debate over the 1Line proposal, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp., with only a minor exception or two, received approval from FERC to implement a new online, interactive computer system. Last month's ruling also went a long way toward completing Transco's effort to comply with orders 637 and 587.  The 1Line system was proposed to enable Transco and other subsidiaries of The Williams Cos. Inc. to put in place new practices and services, including ones related to compliance with orders 637 and 587.

According to Transco, its new scheme cannot be supported by its existing computer systems. But the commission last spring said it was not satisfied with Transco's proposal and asked for a more detailed explanation of how 1Line complies with orders 637 and 587 (IF, 2 April, 16). Looking at the 1Line plan from an order 637 and 587 perspective, FERC in the Sept. 27 order (RP01-236, et al.) found most of the scheme to its liking. It accepted Transco's proposal to change the capacity-release bidding and awarding processes, to incorporate pooling services in its tariff as a new pooling rate schedule, and to provide that any adjustments to a demand bill will be included in a subsequent demand bill, rather than the subsequent commodity bill.

The commission approved Transco's proposal on scheduling equality, which allows shippers acquiring released capacity to submit a nomination at the earliest opportunity after the acquisition of capacity. To raise its comfort level about the provision, FERC directed Transco to change the tariff to permit a shipper's nomination to coincide with the notification of the capacity release transaction and to remove restrictions on the releasing shipper's ability to specify when the release will become effective. FERC also generally was pleased with the provision directing customers to indemnify and hold harmless Transco against all claims. In response to one protester, the commission told the company to remove language that would force customers to indemnify Transco's affiliates as well.

On order 637 matters, FERC was mostly sympathetic to Transco's positions on issues such as imbalance services, operational controls and penalty revenue sharing.
FERC was less enthused with Transco's preferred approach to interaction between the pipeline's segmentation and discounting policies. Refuting the claim that it already complies with order 637 on this issue, FERC directed Transco to add language to its tariff creating a presumption that Transco can rebut a segmenting shipper's right to retain a discounted rate as long as Transco demonstrates that a segmented or secondary point is not similarly situated to point identified in the original transaction. Transco also must add a procedure to its tariff that requires requests to retain discounts to be processed within two hours.

FERC also accepted Transco's existing imbalance cash-out tolerances and tiered cash-out mechanisms, but wanted more information on proposed unauthorized overrun penalties. The pipeline has not ad-equately justified "why such substantial overrun penalties should apply on non-critical days," said the
commission. FERC rejected Transco's proposed transportation charge for imbalance trading, which the pipeline said was needed to recover what it asserts are lost transportation charges. The commission ruled that "Transco has failed to demonstrate that imbalance trades between zones necessarily results in a loss of transportation revenue." But the commission went on to say that it "may be willing to reconsider a remedy if Transco can show that shippers are abusing imbalance trading" to avoid certain charges.

Transco also was directed to justify its proposal to prohibit shippers from trading transportation imbalances and operational balancing agreement imbalances. FERC said that "it is not clear from Transco's explanation why OBA imbalances are so different from shipper transportation imbalances that the two cannot be traded."

=============================================================================================================
FERC ACCEPTED TEXAS GAS' PROPOSAL TO ELIMINATE IMBALANCES on its system by revising its cashout mechanism, while rejecting the proposed use of high/low daily pricing for cashouts. The revamped mechanism, which was developed during and after a technical conference, would enable Texas Gas Transmission Co. to "remove the incentive to engage in price arbitrage on its system," FERC said.

To stop customers from gaming its system, Texas Gas in March proposed (RP01-278) a plan to create a new monthly imbalance tier that would not be subject to cashouts, to eliminate pool-to-pool transfers in the calculation of customer imbalances, and to do away with the provision allowing a processor replacing
plant volume reduction to have its imbalances cashed out at 100% of the applicable index price. Seeing the need for the proposed changes, the commission noted that Texas Gas "has demonstrated with its data a close correlation between the imbalance and price arbitrage that has been taking place for years and has not subsided."

However, FERC rejected the idea of changing the applicable cashout price index at all tier levels to a percentage of either the highest or lowest daily price during the month. Directing Texas Gas to drop the proposed language, the order explained that daily high/low index prices "may unduly increase penalties for imbalances, which is contrary to order 637."

The order went on to say that "a less draconian measure" may be appropriate. For instance, Texas Gas could propose a mechanism "that would inject an element of uncertainty regarding the eventual price" if it wanted to provide "an incentive for shippers to remain in balance," FERC said.

Actually, the service is called "Parkfolio" by the hub.  Sylvia just needs to 
verify that this is a point based service like the IHT service to finish.  If 
you could call sylvia ASAP and all will be finished by today.

As per our conversation today, we will set up a new service for contract 
I00059 that will be "Park and Lend".

I talked with Scott Mills regarding the Sitara end; he said two tickets were 
necessary:

 1.  An Exchange ticket with the counterparty "CPR PIPELINE EXCHANGE" (when 
done with the pipeline) and
 2.  A Storage Capacity Ticket with the pipeline (CNG Sabine Hub Services) as 
the counterparty.  This is where you
  will set up the rate you have negotiated with the pipeline and the service 
that Molly can path on so as to
  get the correct rate for the service.

I will check with Kirk Lenart to confirm the correct way for Global to set 
this up and I will let you know so you may select it on your deal ticket.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was 
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed 
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have January 
and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Paulette

Roman and Paulette,

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday
March 24th. As soon as Mark Feldman (Enron payment God) receives February's
bill, he can pay this one too.

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

The Egan storage contract expires on August 31,200.  This is an evergreen

DTI have reached a 637 settlement with it's customers, they have filed with FERC for approval, the first pipeline to reach a settlement. The settlement includes the netting and trading of imbalances, intraday recalls on released capacity, and other GISB mandates that took years to implement but in reality have no application to the industry.
Liquidity has increased on the system, TTT volumes have increased from 3 Bcf/d to 5 Bcf/d over the last year with a 5:1 ration of physical to traded volumes. 
The interconnect with Empire @ Lysander currently flowing 30-60,000dt/d has a maximum capability of 100,000dt/d.  Empire is now allowing secondary deliveries to Lysander therefore volumes have increased at the location.  Note:  Empire recently bought out by Union from ANR.
DTI have an new pipeline project called Green brier.  A new company will be started that will consist of DTI as part owners and operators and other equity interests.  The new pipeline will flow 600,000 dt/d from Cornwell (interconnect with Tennessee and DTI) and run down through VA, into Granville County, NC.
DTI are offering winter only (30cents) and summer only (13cents) service, the project is designed to compete with Transco's Momentum expansion into Zn4.  
DTI have remarketed all the 55 Bcf of GSS that was turned back over the past year and also reconstructed for 90% of the 2.2 Bcf/d of transport.
Another project they are looking to release to the market is an expansion of deliveries to Leidy in conjunction with Marketlink.
DTI have a current transportation offering, Lebanon to Leidy capacity 29,100dt/d, for one year starting 11/1/01.  DTI are looking and will probably get max rates (approximately 30 cents).
DTI will be increasing the transportation fuel rates from 2.28% to 2.78% as per a TCRA settlement recently agreed to by it's customers.  The net effect of this will be a small reduction in the delivered quantity at the delivery locations and a small amount of stranded receipt point capacity on peak days.  This news has not been released to the market, I'm not sure when this will take effect.

For spot delivered or transported deals, as tickets keep getting bigger with 
more and more meters and more and more days on them, they take  longer and 
longer to save (release).  For now, Chris keep doing what you 're doing.  As 
Chris creates deals (buy /sells/ or spot sales), he'll send  e-mails with 
quick descriptions for CES Retail notification and enter them into Sitara as 
buy/sells.  THanks Chris and thanks TCO team

Well, they will probably file a court appeal, but it doesn't look good.


NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
 published : April 19, 2000

               ANR Gets Green Light for Transco Interconnect

      ANR Pipeline last week won a two-year battle at FERC to build a direct 
interconnect to Transcontinental
      Gas Pipe Line's mainline facilities at Evangeline Parish, LA --- near 
the site of an active natural gas sales
      market. 

      On rehearing, the Commission upheld a July 1998 order granting a 
complaint in which ANR accused
      Transco of discriminating against it by denying a request to construct 
minor interconnection facilities that
      would provide its shippers with direct access to gas sales markets on 
Transco's system at Evangeline. 

      Specifically, the Coastal Corp. pipeline has fought to obtain a direct 
connection to Station 50, which is one
      of several compressor stations on Transco's mainline serving as pooling 
points. There, producers and
      marketers sell gas to LDCs and other buyers who hold firm capacity on 
Transco for shipment to
      downstream markets. The gas sale market at Station 50 is said to be a 
"premium one." 

      In order to get their gas to Station 50 now, ANR shippers must deliver 
gas via ANR's existing
      interconnection on Transco's Central Louisiana Lateral at Eunice, LA, 
and then purchase interruptible
      transportation (IT) service on Transco for a distance of about 7.4 
miles. So, in effect, ANR shippers
      currently must pay "stacked rates" for service on ANR's existing 
interconnect and for service on Transco's
      IT feeder to reach Station 50. 

      But the Commission last week found that ANR's request for a direct 
interconnection at Evangeline was
      reasonable under three different analyses. "First, the evidence shows 
that Transco has provided no
      reasonable justification for denying ANR's request, given Transco's 
history of granting such requests made
      by similarly situated parties," the order said [CP98-74]. Six pipelines 
other than ANR currently have direct
      interconnections on Transco's mainline in the Gulf region that were 
established prior to Transco's
      restructuring under Order 636, and none of the shippers pay an IT rate 
in order to get gas to Transco's
      mainline markets, according to the order. 

      Secondly, evidence suggests the denial of an interconnection for ANR 
has led to "specific competitive harm
      to the operations of sales markets on Transco's mainline," the 
Commission said. That's because buyers at
      Station 50 have been barred access to the competitively priced gas 
supplies that ANR's shippers seek to
      offer, FERC noted. Lastly, it said the establishment of the Evangeline 
interconnect for ANR was required
      under the new five-step interconnection policy for gas pipelines, which 
FERC unveiled last week. 

      In upholding the July 1998 decision, the Commission overturned an 
administrative law judge's (ALJ) initial
      findings that competition hadn't been adversely harmed at Station 50, 
and that FERC's prior approval of the
      IT feeder system provided "appropriate support" for Transco to deny ANR 
the Evangeline interconnect. 

      "We are persuaded by the record in this case that ANR cannot offer a 
pipeline transportation service
      reasonably competitive with those provided by Transco and other 
interstate pipelines, without the
      Evangeline interconnect, a minor facility consisting of valve access to 
Transco's mainline," the order
      concluded. 

      The Commission also rejected Transco's claim that it partly denied 
ANR's request for the Evangeline
      interconnect because it would have led to a revenue loss on its IT 
Feeder system. As the FERC staff noted,
      "six other interstate pipelines currently use mainline interconnects 
[on Transco].....but no evidence indicates
      the extent of even arguably identifiable business loss from these 
pipeline competitors," the order noted. If
      anything, "Transco has accorded itself an anti-competitive 
preference.....to assure that its own IT service is
      used in lieu of the potential alternative proposed by ANR."

To ensure everyone is on the same page.... Steve Stonestreet at TCO and I had 
a conversation on how TCO works its storage ratchets. Steve, if I have 
misstated something, please let us know.

There is a FSS schedule that tells the ratchets, minimum injections, maximum 
withdrawals, etc. This FSS schedule has been updated in the attached 
spreadsheet with Enron's SCQ and Enron's MDSQ, which enables Enron to know 
its different volume requirements.

Based on the attached schedule, each month there are different Maximum 
Monthly Injection Quantities (MMIQ)  based on Enron's SCQ. There is no 
Minimum Injection Quantity required by TCO.

TCO Injection Session and % of SCQ;

April = 15%
May = 20%
June = 20%
July = 20%
Aug = 20%
Sept = 13%
Oct = 7 %

If you add these months up, the total Injection is 115%. Essentially, 
shippers have an extra 15% that does not have to be used during the injection 
period. Please note, Shippers can inject all year around on TCO (November is 
5% and December through March is 10%... typically not done).

For example, Shippers do not have to inject the ratchet amount in April 
(15%). If the Shipper falls behind on the STOI, and the Shipper needs to 
catch up on STOI in the future months, and the Shipper wants to go over the 
ratchet level for that month, then TCO will need to give its prior approval 
(I sound like a lawyer). Typically, TCO is more willing to approve 
overinjections in the early months of the injection session versus 
overinjecting in September and October, when TCO is full. 


Some other basic rules;

Shippers do not have to fill storage 100% by October.

Shippers cannot have more than  60% in storage by June 1st, unless 
overinjection is approved by TCO.

Shippers can have daily net withdrawals in the summer, and it works the same 
way it did in the Winter. Depending on the % SCQ, this will determine the 
MDWQ. As of today, 8.3% is in the ground so Enron can net withdraw 54,324. 
Once Enron is between 10% to 20%, then the MDWQ is 70,521... but remember 
Enron's SST is only 54,324 until October 1st... so other transport will need 
to be used to avoid overrun charges.


Why do we care about all of this....

Enron wants to slow down on the injection into storage. Because choice still 
uses storage withdrawal in April and storage withdrawal is used for 
Hopewell... there may be days that we are net withdrawing. As long as we stay 
below 54,324... there will not be penalties. If we go over this amount, we 
will need to get gas controls approval... the same drill we use for 
overinjections above 36,304.

TCO Schedulers... we have been doing a great job monitoring this so far. 
April is a very hard month to monitor storage. Remember, if we have problems 
running Storage reports from our PC's or Laptops, TCO has the ability to run 
the reports and TCO will run it on the weekends if necessary. From these 
reports, we can determine if we need to get the overwithdrawal or 
overinjection approval from TCO's Gas Control. TCO's gas control will need a 
volume amount to place in their book... which is the bible for TCO enforcing  
penalties. The penalties are pretty steep... max is $10 dkt.

Chris - 
The 2000tran03 spreadsheet appears to have all the rates correct in the CES 
wholesale tab, except the the Pennfuel TETCO stuff and the Transco IT 
contract.

After talking to Victor, he said this was the correct process. I'm thinking 
Joann  can update the CES and Calp tickets in the morning when she runs the 
new navigator reports. Joann can also update Dayton's ticket in the afternoon 
from our spreadsheet or Steve's. 

Joann, let me or Robert know if you need some help in updating these tickets.

Thanks.

Subject: Transport Usage Tickets - Daily Updates

Now that TCO has slowed down... want to ensure everyone is on the same page.

Chris helped TCO out in January by updating the Transport Tickets. Chris 
thought we were updating the tickets in February. We thought Chris was 
updating the tickets. Unfortunately.. they were not updated.

Starting with March Forward... please advise if this is the correct process.

Sitara #

95448 = 180,000  This ticket will be used for Enron North America as Shipper??
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

165985 = 50,000  This ticket will be used for Dayton as Shipper??
   We have a daily Dayton spreadsheet that we use to schedule from and Steve 
Gillespie also sends out a daily sheet.

165984 = 20,000  This ticket will be used for Calp as Shipper??  
   Joann can get this number off her daily navigator reports or maybe we can 
modify a navigator report.

Let me know if we are thinking this through correctly.

Thanks for your patience!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Scott--
Something for you to consider:
If the transport people are to have their own books, my belief is that the 
curve setting used for the transport values ought to be as unbiased as 
possible.  This means using as few "formula based" curves as possible and as 
many Gas Daily publication postings as possible.  I'm not sure how you or 
your traders feel about the following postings, (how realistic they are), but 
I think they bear watching to see if they could be used for calculating 
transport p&l.  In Gas Daily, under Citygate, Pooling Point Prices, there are 
Mid Atlantic Citygates postings for both CNG and Columbia Gas.  These could 
potentially be used for CNG North & South Citygates and TCO citygates.  The 
only thing I have to confirm is how these would load since there is no index 
posted each day--it is a range of prices instead.

Historically TCO and CNG citygate postings haven't been much of an issue 
because we haven't held much transport on CNG and TCO, but with the CES 
business in our portfolio, the times have changed.  Currently we are using 
"formula based" curves set by the traders to calculate CNG and TCO transport 
p&l, and there sure seems to be a huge difference between the postings and 
how we are marking the curves.  For example, today's Gas Daily postings 
compared to our curve markings are as follows:
GAS DAILY   GAS DAILY SPREAD   SPREADS per TRADERS CURVES
TCO pool $2.985   $1.565     $.10
TCO citygate $4.55

CNG North $3.39   $  .585     $.16
CNG South $3.305   $  .670     $.16~
CNG Citygate $3.975

Obviously there are huge differences, so someone must be wrong.  There are 
two solutions that I see.  One is to switch to the Gas Daily posting, which 
in my mind is preferable if you believe the postings are accurate; the other 
solution is to have the traders change their curves more often to more 
closely reflect the actual spreads in the marketplace.  That's up to you.  
Obviously if we believe the postings are completely off base and our spreads 
are more accurate, then nothing needs to be done, but if you want to know 
what you're really making on your transport (and you now have a lot of it), 
we need to focus on it being accurate.

Anyway, let me know what you decide and I'll either forget about it or work 
on getting the Gas Daily postings pulled into the calculations.

Colleen,

Mark wanted me to let you know where a few city gate points are settling 
daily:

CNG North City Gate = GD CNG North +.16
CNG South City Gate = Settles at what the intra-month trader sets their 
intra-month curve at.
TECO Citygate = GD CGT/App +.10

Please note that CNG North City and TECO City settle prices come in at a one 
day lag.  After we receive gas daily settles, we reload prices for any 
derived curves.
If you have any questions please let me know.

Hello Everyone-

Attached is an updated version of the expiring transportation contracts by 
Pipeline and by Expiration Date.

I f you have any questions about this worksheet please give me a call.  I 
have sorted it three different ways for you, but the base data is the same in 
all three versions.

Thanks,

Attached are two documents containing the regulatory summaries for this 
period.  The first is the same document you are used to seeing--a summary of 
all types of filings made by the pipelines to FERC.  The second is a special 
document that contains only the Order 637 compliance filings that have been 
made.  As I'm sure most of you are aware, each pipeline must make a filing 
indicating how it intends to comply with the new Order 637 regulations.  For 
your convenience I have included in the second attachment an explanation of 
the new Order 637 requirements, followed by the compliance filings that I 
have received to date.   I will update this document as new filings are 
received.  If you have any questions, I may be reached at x35514.

AGL just sent me a copy of an existing contract on Transco that has been
converted to a new type of contract. I assume this is one that is released to
us for their Choice program. Who should get the copy and could you please give
me a fax number?

I talked to John Hodge this morning and here is the scoop.

51407 is the master agreement for CES for Storage withdrawals and injections. 
This master agreement is contract number used for scheduling. This contract 
tracks the withdrawal and injections charges.

Any FSS storage deal that is done will appear on a separate contract number. 
Only the accountants will see this contract number. For billing purposes, it 
will track the demand and capacity charges. This is the case for 63304, which 
is the CES Retail Storage deal. We never use this contract for scheduling. 
Don't think Victor created a separate Sitara deal ticket, so should be okay 
in Sitara.

This concept is similar to Transco, where you have one nominating contract 
for your transport and there are individual contracts for billing purposes.

Hopefully I said this correct... we can ask John Hodge for better 
clarification if needed. His number at enron is X37276.

Thanks.

I created deal 159513 to capture the IT gas we are flowing on IROQ for Jan 
and Feb.  Here is how it works.

Rate Comment
 1.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Waddington to Wright
 2.  Flow gas through our parking contract at Wright
 3.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Waddington to Pleasant Valley
 4.  Flow gas through parking at Pleasant Valley
 5.  Schedule gas on our IT contract from Pleasant Valley to S Commack.


The total cost is about $1.00.  I will follow up with the exact cost later.

Please let me know if you are interested in learning how to run the 
transportation model to assist you in pricing long term transport deals.  The 
model is not difficult to run once you understand what inputs are necessary.  
Also remember once you've learned to use this model that it is not "cut and 
dry"--it is just one of the tools that we have for pricing forward 
transportation.  

For anyone that would like to learn, I will be more than happy to come by 
your desk or, if you do not currently have access to the model, you can come 
by my desk for a demo.  I believe the instruction will work better either one 
on one or in very small groups.

Also, if I have missed someone that you believe would benefit from the 
transportation model instruction, please advise.

Hello all:

We will be out of the office June 5 through June 8.  On the mornings of
the 5th and the 8th we will be airborne during the usual IT trading
time.  As such, we would like to sell for Tuesday's gas day on Friday,
June 2 (much like this past Memorial Day Weekend) and for Friday's gas
day on Wednesday, June 7.

Fri June 2 - sell for Sat June 3 through Tues June 6 gas days
Tues June 6 - sell for Wed June 7 gas day
Wed June 7 - sell for Thurs June 8 and Fri June 9 gas day
Fri June 9 - back in the office, sell for Sat June 10 - Mon June 12 gas
days, business as usual

While we are away you can beep us at 860-260-6741.  If you call
203-944-7006 and leave a message, please make it a DETAILED one, because
the voicemail automatically beeps us at the above number, and we call in
to listen to the messages.  Please don't leave a message and then beep
us anyway, you will just be delaying our response to you.  You can also
try us directly at the hotel - 602-955-6600.

Please call either of us at the numbers below if you have any questions.

Robin & Maria

Crystal,

I know that you have already set up the TAGG deals, I just wanted to be sure 
that you had all of the information.

We are able to park up to 300,000 over the month of October.  The gas is to 
be returned to us in January 2001.  The fee is .04 per MMBtu, but it will be 
negotiable on a daily basis.  This will be billed prorata from October to 
January.  The volumes can also flluctuate daily.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Just for your information--this may highlight the reason for the difficulty 
for the East Region dividing its transportation usage tickets by contract 
number.  For the entire month of May, the Central region's transport p&l 
report is 20 pages long (and that's after splitting up transport tickets by 
contract number); the West report is 34 pages long; and the East + Market 
East report is 90 pages long without splitting transport tickets by contract 
number.  If the East began breaking up usage tickets by contract number, it 
could result in a five to seven fold increase in tickets.  

Any thoughts ?

ENA pays 89.17% of the demand  and commodity charges and 100% of the fuel.  
Now we pay the pipelines 100% and Boston Gas reimburses us the difference.  
Our Canadian producer group is charged the whole 89.17% of the transportation 
charges and all of the fuel in their netback pricing.

Hope this answers your question...

I will let you know a final time for our follow up meeting regarding position 
reporting on transportation capacity.  As you recall, I wanted each of you to 
pick one pipeline (a difficult one) and let me know how you would go about 
assessing an initial position for that capacity, and how you know on a daily 
basis what has been used and what is remaining.  Hopefully this will assist 
us in translating that information into a formal position reporting system.

If you are not planning to be here on any days next week, please let me know 
that so that I can plan the meeting accordingly.  As always, I will set the 
meeting up sometime between 11:00 am and 1:00 p.m.

Thank you.

Paulette,

It's not Enron's intention to have Calp fund the OPT 60 payment. Enron
would like for Calp to release the capacity in Enron's name during the
winter period, and this would send the bills directly to Enron and
eliminate funding by Calp and reimbursement of Enron to Calp. We can look
at this again next winter. I'm not sure why there was a delayed payment
once Calp gave Enron the bill a month ago. I'll ask Mark Feldman about wire
transfers.

Thanks again for your patience.

Joan,

The deal with CES was that the invoice would be paid upon receipt.  It was
never
CALP's intent to fund the OPT 60 payment.  As requested, I will faxed
February's
bill to Robin.  Since the January payment is so late, could you have
January and
February's payments wire transferred to CALP's account?

Thanks!

Sorry for the delay. January's check will be sent out tomorrow, Friday

Thank you for your patience during this transition.

Revision in bold.  Pass on to any who may need this.

In order to provide the ability to track transport expense by Desk, Sitara 
was modified to allow multiple Transport Capacity tickets for the same 
Service Contract provided that they are for different desks and only one is 
tagged as "Primary".  Here is the procedure for setting up new Capacity 
tickets to reflect the "other" desks:

a.  You will probably first notice this via a warning/error message in Path 
Manager when building a new path.  The message will read something like   
"Source/Destination 123456 for desk IMCT does not match Service contract 3434 
and will be removed."
b.  Make note of the deal number in the Service List of the Service contract 
that you were using in the new path.
c.  Open that Transport Capacity deal in Sitara.  Then hit Copy.
d.  On the new deal:
 Change the Buyer from the old desk to the new desk that matches the Supply 
or Market deal that you are pathing with.  If it a deal for which we are 
  agent, then don't change the Buyer but instead change the Agent to the new 
desk.  The "primary" deal will carry the actual Agent.  The Agent
  contract will get cleared.  Re-select the Agent Contract.
 Changing the Buyer causes the Contract field to get blanked out.  Re-select 
the Pipeline contract.
 Just above the various exchange line items is a Primary Deal check box.  
Un-check it.
 On each exchange line item, change the MDQ to zero and for any Negotiated 
rates, uncheck them as well.  The "primary" deal will carry the MDQ and
  any negotiated Demand, Commodity or fuel.
 Hit Release.
e.  You may need to re-retrieve Path Manager.  You should see the Deal number 
in the Service list now read "Multiple".  Right-click/Service Deals will list 
the  specific deals.
f.  Re-build the path as you originally desired.  The warning/error message 
should not appear again.

This could occur for any combination of Desk and Service Contract.
Please file this in your "Call Dave If I Can't Find This" folder.

Thanks, d.n.

Melissa,

I'm not sure if you are the correct person to receive this message.  We have 
been checking with all the applicable pipelines to make sure the transport 
and storage capacity is back in BUNY's name as of April 1.  All of the 
pipelines appear to be on board, but Texas Gas and TETCO specifically seem to 
be expecting some correspondence from BUNY to this effect.  We want to make 
sure all of this goes smoothly next week, so could you guys let us know where 
this stands in your shop?

Thanks.
Kate

This was response from Tom on question about  the deal # for Bug contract 414 
on Tenn that you were unable to terminate.  I've cleaned up the other 3 deals

Somehow they broke the program rules - I will have to check that out - deal 
229101 was supposed to be ENA-IM EAST as a secondary desk to the BUG deal.   
They were able to save it as BUG as the secondary - which they should not be 
able to do - as this breaks the one deal rule per business unit per contract 
per time perod. 

I cleaned up the deals for you - it is the only way I could make sure it 
worked - and removed the evergreen flag off the the BUG deal. 

There are 3 more deals that have May forward activity - can you follow up on 
these - don't forget to cancel the evergreen on the service deals or they 
will just keep rolling.

Molly - Chris Germany preferred to have new deals for these.  These are 
necessary due to there being two different transportation adjustments for the 
producers' group of meters (points).  The existing deals are OK for certain 
meters, but new deals are needed for the other meters.  Please modify 
existing deals and provide new deals as follows:

The term is March through Oct.
For March, you use K# 910076
For Apr-Oct, you use K# 910077

The demand is .03,  the ACA is .0022 and the commodity and fuel is
different depending on what zone you use.

If you use STX to M3, the commodity is .0623,  ETX or ELA  to M3, the
commodity is .0570, and the commodity WLA to M3, the commodity is .0586.
 let me know what else you need????

This is just FYI-

I think we really need to ask Dan, Judy and Chris to dedicate some time to 
map the market area points accurately.  (What I mean is making sure each 
location has the proper valuation attached to it in Sitara.)  Just so you 
know, when I print out the market area transport p&l, there are 85 
tickets/paths set up, and only 19 of those show a positive p&l.  I know that 
we are not using that much transport that is out of the money--I'm sure this 
is just a case of no one going in and making sure the mappings for each 
location in the market area are accurate.  I would just go ahead and do this, 
but I I do not know the market area points and valuations well enough.  There 
are a few simple things I could point out that need fixing (i.e., TCO pool vs 
TCO citygate--as prices go up and cost of fuel goes up, no one is adjusting 
the curves between the two points, so your transport starts out in the money 
and ends up out of the money; another example is CNR--the gathering charge on 
CNR is now $.44, but we still have our curve set at TCO pool minus $.32.)

Anyway, I know the market area is a bit more difficult because of valuation 
issues, but I have to believe we could do better than 19 out of 85.  (And on 
some pipes, like Tennessee, the ration is 0/33).

I know this is a pain to fix, but one day I do envision that we will have 
automatic notification of capacity being in or out of the money, but that 
will be meaningless if we are not set up to value points properly.

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel 
waivers on the primary capacity deal in Sitara.  Do I need to enter them on 
the secondary capacity deal ticket?

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing 
from the Gulf (East Region) to CNG (Market East Region).  Which transport 
capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

Thanks for the info!  Do you know what the key is to make sure the tickets 
show up in Unify on the right desk?  Also how do we assure flash is on right 
desk or is this not going to be an issue if we are using the Service P & l to 
flash?  If we use the Service P & L to flash, will the transport info in 
Unify and the flash amts. be the same and on the same desk?  How this makes 
sense!

Effective April 1st, we will have several Transport Capacity tickets set up 
under 2 desk, Market East and East.  All longhaul capacity on Tetco, Trco, 
and Tenn will be set up under both desk.  

All capacity on CNG, Iroq, Equit, Nat Fuel, and CGAS will be Market East.  
Now, all of our current capacity on these pipes is either Bug, which goes 
away on 4/1, or East.  So even on these pipes you will probably see the same 
contract under both desk.


Comments/questions?

I was wondering if this would work:  

Problem:  Third party demand reimbursements for transport are kept on 
spreadsheets.  I would like to automate this process.  

Solution:  Is it possible to enter a capacity ticket with a counterparty 
(like ConEd), not a pipeline, and show a negative amount (or the opposite of 
what we enter in when we are paying out a charge) therefore resulting in a 
credit to the desk for that amount?    Would the system accept such an entry 
and would this generate the proper documentation for accounting?

For example, if the East Desk has a deal where ConEd releases capacity to ENA 
at max rate, but then reimburses ENA for the demand charge (ENA pays the 
commodity costs), the tickets would be entered as follows:
 1) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charges of $.10, 
Counterparty = Transco   -   ENA will pay $$$ to the pipeline
 2) a transportation capacity ticket showing demand charge of -.10, 
Counterparty = Con Ed        -   ENA will receive $$$ from ConEd

It seems like this should work and would eliminate one more manual piece of 
this transport p&l.

I have spoken with Rick Ward at CES about this.  We will provide CES with 
copies of any invoices that have pre 1/2000 charges on them.  We will 
pay/take the credit after CES has agreed to the adjustments.  We will then 
bill/pay CES monthly for these adjustments.  If this is inconsistent with any 
agreements between CES and ENA, please let me know.  Otherwise, we will 
continue down this path.  Thanks.

Subject:	Possible Change to GRI Rates in Jan 2002

The Gas Research Institute has filed a proposal to revise the GRI surcharges from the level previously authorized in the 1998 Settlement.  GRI's filing has not been approved yet, but the Settlement provides for an adjustment under certain circumstances so there is a good chance it will be.  We will advise you of the outcome when FERC issues an order on GRI's proposal.  The new rates would still be below the current rates.  Both sets of rates are provided below for your convenience.



Rates (cents per Dth)	Current 2001	Settlement 2002	New Proposal 2002	
Commodity	0.7	0.5	0.55	
High Demand*	9.0	6.0	6.6	
Low Demand*	5.5	3.7	4.07	
Small Customer	1.1	0.8	0.88	
  				

*refers to high load factor or low load factor customers.

If FERC approves this proposal, the rates for 2003 will likely change from those in the Settlement as well.

Chris, Faye has completed moving all of the facilities on your request, 
EXCEPT meter 006335 because a deal that is booked on that meter had volumes 
with a status other than "expected" which means we have to work on that 
behind the scenes.  Below is a list of deals that were impacted by her moving 
all of the other meters.  I am bouncing the server and it wil take about 15 
minutes to complete.  After that, you will have to get completely out of all 
open Sitara applications (including the Launch Pad) and get back in.  Open 
the deals listed below and make sure the location field on the deal exchange 
says "inconsistent".  You should only be concerned with the exchanges for 
6/1/00 and forward.  Click Edit and then go to the location field and click 
on the ellipsis.  Click OK when the Facility dialogue box opens and the 
correct zone should appear automatically.  Before you tab out of that field, 
make sure that the deal volume equals the expected volume.  If the volumes 
are not equal, make a note of the expected volumes and how they are broken 
out because they will default to the deal volume as soon as you tab out.  If 
the volumes are different, update them as necessary and then release the 
deal.  Repeat this for all exchanges for 6/1/00 and forward and for all 
deals.  The second thing you need to do is identify any swaps that are linked 
to the physical forwards.  If none are linked then that's great because you 
won't have to worry about that.  If some exist, you will have to update the 
swap to reflect the correct zone.  To do this, you need to edit the swap, go 
to the field location, remove the current (inconsistent) one and add the 
correct zone.  Hopefully this makes sense.  Please call me if you have any 
questions.  I will follow up with you on the meter 006335 tomorrow.

I have fuel waivers on my CNG transport contracts.  I am entereing these fuel

Also, I have an IT discount on one of my Tennessee contracts on gas flowing

capacity deal ticket should I enter the discount on?

Yesterday, Logistics, Volume Management and the CGAS Trader met to discuss 
pathing arrangements for the CES Storage deal.

 C R I T I C AL   I N F O R M A T I O N   F O R   V O L U M E   M A N A G E M 
E N T
  * All Storage Account Balances for contracts 67713, 51407 and 39607 should 
not be valued as an ENA asset
   - The storage inventory is CES's inventory and NOT owned by ENA.
   - The storage inventory on contracts 67713, 51407 and 39607 should NOT be 
part of the UA4 calculation
   - Fuel associated with storage injection should be part of 
  * The "Select Point" feature will be used to create the sale to CES in 
storage.  This pathing process will allow deal
     to be settled. 
   -The "Point" balances should NOT be part of the UA4 calculation
   

Logistics is in the process of correcting pathing arrangements for the 
injection season to match the schematic as provided below.  Once this is 
completed, Volume Management can complete the actualization process.

Logistics did make part of the corrections needed for the withdrawal season, 
to allow actualization on the storage contract; yet did not redo the 
transportation piece.   Due to this, the pipeline is not in balance.  

Logistics would like to meet with Volume Management and discuss this clean up 
process.  I will try to set up a meeting for next week (Anastas, Kelly, 
Lamadrid, Collins, Fuller, Superty & me).   How does Wednesday afternoon 
(9/20/00 at 2 p.m.) look for you guys?  

Please get with me if you have any questions.  If you could also please 
forward to anyone I may have excluded from this email.

Thanks,

dg

Pathing arrangements for CES Storage deals should be created following the 
schematics below.

To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve 
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ. 
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my 
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a 
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been 
approved.

Subject: CGAS Storage

I made some big changes to the CGAS storage deals 268094 (no changes on this 
ticket), 268090, and 268093.

Over the 4 day weekend we are over injecting 195,600 dth.  We will show this 
volume coming out in June.  I also made about a 7,000 dth change to the 
volumes coming out in August.

I am still showing most of the withdrawal of the ENA balance in August.

Let me know if you have any questions.

To ensure everyone is on the same page.

500,000 over May's MMIQ was already approved and in TCO's gas control records.
200,000 to 300,000 additional was approved on Thursday, May 25, with Steve 
Stonestreet, Julie Watkins, and Brian Adams, verbally on the phone.

Enron should have a total of 800,000 on gas control's books over May's MMIQ. 
Joann needs a total of 822,000 to overinject for the month. Per my 
conversation with Mike Ng, he will ask for the incremental 22,000; for a 
total of 822,000. Mike will let us know if the incremental 22,000 has been 
approved.

Joann also needs the 59,520 for May 31st for a daily overinjection which has

Good Afternoon.

Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
at
PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
you
the option to inform Chris.

The January check just arrived at Chantilly. Kathy is fedexing it directly to
Cash Management for morning delivery.  The late receipt is due to the fact 
that
it was addressed to the old Fairfax office and not to the Irvine CA address
requested on the invoice.   I just spoke to Robin Barbe (who checked with 
their
accounting staff) and understand that Enron feels that the effort to stop the
check, and immediately execute a wire transfer would not be productive.

Roman

Joan,

CALP has received the wire transfer payment for the month of February (thank
you).  However, January's check , which was mailed on March 24th, has still 
not
arrived.  I have to make both a debt payment and a partner distribution on
Monday, April 3rd. Since the partners only receive distributions twice a year,
it would be helpful if CALP received Januarys payment.  Could Enron put a stop
payment on January's check and have the funds wire transferred to CALP's 
account
tomorrow?  Anything you could do would be helpful.

Thanks!

Paulette

On the 31st we parked a grand total of 37,503.  That will change the number

These numbers will change a little but this is what we currently have in the 
system.

Parking in May  55,150 dth/total (deal 281565)
Taking out in June 1,837 dth/day  (deal 281556)

I'm not sure if the May numbers are net of fuel and we don't have an exact 
parking number for today as well.

David, where do I show the $.04 parking fee.  We are paying $.04 times the 
total volume parked, not the daily balance.

I met with Jeff Kiester of DTI yesterday regarding the storage offering they 
have on the market.  They have 3 Bcf storage capacity and 30,000dt/d of 
FT-GSS up for bid by 2/12/01. However there will be up to an additional 10 
Bcf of storage capcity available before 4/1/01 depending on additional 
turnback.  All of this capacity is utility turnback mainly, East Ohio, 
National Fuel and RG&E.
Potential uses for DTI storage:
1.  Desk use - If we buy the storage without the transportation we would 
inject and withdraw at SP.  If we do submit a bid, I would recommend that we 
try to incorporate free intramonth injection capability, effectivly giving us 
a no-notice type service that we could use to take physical positions in the 
cash market.  The current park/loan rate is $0.07 /dt/d, it seems we utilize 
this 2-3 times a month.
2.  VNG - AGL could want to look into adding storage to the VNG portfolio,  
the drawback is that the PL1 line has no excess deliverability, VNG's need is 
more a peak day issue.
3.  Partner with EES - Paul Tate from EES also sat in on our meeting, he 
expressed an interest in looking into potential partnering oppourtunities 
with the East desk regarding markets on TCO and DTI.  This storage offering 
for example could be something we partner on.  I plan to meet with Paul at 
the beggining of next week to discuss further (Dick I will check with you on 
your availability).

Jeff also indicated there will be more transportation capacity turned back in 
the near future.  There will be a posting for 75,000 dt/d of Lebanon - Leidy 
capacity coming out in the next few weeks.  

Market view on capacity release:
With the utilities turning back transportation, the economics of the capacity 
release market will change.  The utilities have historically released 
transportation in the summer months for $0.05 or less (as low as $0.01) in 
order to recover something from their asset.  DTI will now be the marketer of 
the turned back capacity.  Historically the pipeline has been very reluctant 
to sell capacity below max rate in the winter and less than 50% ($0.12 at 
current rates) in the summer.   Jeff indicated that his view is that capacity 
values will increase slighly this summer and significantly next summer due to 
the new power gen load coming online 2002.  As part of DTI's last rate case 
settlement FT-GSS holders can no longer release transportation in the summer, 
that went into effect last summer-00.  Although the capacity release market 
was a little tighter last summer it did not significantly drive up capacity 
release prices in the summer-00.  My view is that two of the three power gen 
loads will be interuptible and therfore will not sigificantly increase the 
overall load factor of the system.  The bottom line is that DTI is competing 
with capacity release and I feel there will be enough capacity release 
available on the market this summer to force DTI to sell it's capacity below 
50% of max rate.  However capacity release prices may increase next year as 
more utilities turnback capacity and the new power generation may be in the 
capacity release market.

Market View on Basis on CNG for Summer 01 & Summer 02:
With the increased load and potentially low storage inventory level going 
into this summer, basis could be strong vs historical prices. However, with 
the inception of M&NEP delivering 400,000dt/d into the Northeast last year 
CNG basis (summer strip) was less than $0.20 in Jan-00 and Feb-00,  even 
though the April 1 storage inventory level was the lowest since 1996.  In 
1996 CNG Apr-Oct strip traded as high as high as $0.31 in Feb-96 and dropped 
as low as $0.21 by May-96.  DTI summer load is averages 2.5 - 3.0 Bcf, I 
don't think the 100,000dt/d load of the new power gen load will be 
significant this summer considering the additional supply coming in from 
Dracut.   However with American National Power Inc (34,000Dth/d) and El Paso 
Gas Services Co (139,000dt/d) both coming online in 2001, that have 
contracted for around half of the Dracut supply, this may cause sumer basis 
prices to increase from current levels (Apr-01-Oct-01 strip $0.33) this 
summer and depending on storage inventories 4/1/02,  Apr-Oct-02 basis may be 
also get stronger.

Tetco held a 637 "settlement" conference last Fiday to discuss their latest 
proposal dated March 8th.  Their new proposal involved the institution of a 
weekly cash-out mechanism along with a daily variance penalty based on 
overall system position.

In brief:
PENALTIES
Stage One--on any day where a shipper's imbalance in greater than 7% in any 
zone, the "daily imbalance charge" would be 2x the maximum PAL rate for the 
entire balance (not just the piece that's over 7%) in each zone.
Stage Two--on any day where either the Market Area or Access Area is out of 
balance by greater than 4%, Tetco would have the discretion to issue a Stage 
Two notice, establishing a tolerance level (which could be 0, subject to 
Tetco's sole discretion) that all shippers would have not less than 12 hours' 
notice with which to comply.  Under Tetco's propsal, any volumes in excess of 
the level stated in the notice would be assessed a "daily imbalnce charge" 
equal to 4x the maximum PAL rate.
In a Stage 2 situation, if your imbalance is in the opposite direction of the 
pipe, no penalty would be charged (but you'd still cash-out)

CASH-OUT
Weekly monetization of cash-out positions based on a Sunday to Saturday week 
(Tetco needs to revise this so that the weeks are managed depending on how 
the calendar falls so that they minimize problems like a 2-day week).
Monetization by Zone in 2 tiers
 0-4% to be cashed-out at the average of each day's mid point price for the 
weekly period
 4%+ ENTIRE IMBALANCE cashed-out at the weekly highest/lowest common price 
for the week 
This is a significant change since under the current tariff, shippers pay a 
staggered fee, such that volumes with in the first tier are charged that 
tier's price, then overflow into the next tier is charged at that tier's 
price, etc.  Now, the entire amount would be assessed the higher price.

NETTING & TRADING
would be limited to the week in which the imbalance was incurred and would be 
limited by zone (contrary to Order 637)
Any netting or trading would not decrease the daily imbalance charge (the 
positions would be frozen each day) but could decrease the cash-out exposure 
(completely contrary to 637 which indicates that netting & trading should be 
a tool used to limit penalties)

Results:
it would be possible, in fact likely, that a shipper would pay both an 
imbalance penalty and a cash-out fee on the same volume (contrary to Order 
637)
under the Zero tolerance Stage Two scenario, Tetco would have complete 
discretion to set the level (not itself a bad thing, they need to be able to 
control their system)--they've indicated that they'd set a 2% floor for 
penalties but that doesn't really solve the problem.
not only would the cash-out mechanism be more difficult to administer, it 
could significantly increase our cash-out liability and subject us to 
penalties that do not exist today.

Dynegy, PGC and Indicated Shippers indicated to Tetco that we don't see any 
progress towards settlement, or even a foundation to go forward on and that 
we're ready at this point to go to the Commission for a decision on their 637 
filing as a whole.  Several of the LDC's stated that they want to continue to 
pursue settlement so we agreed to submit a status report to Staff indicating 
that we'll continue to talk, setting an April 30th deadline.  At that point, 
I expected that Tetco would attempt to establish an aggressive negotiation 
schedule in an effort to make some progress--instead all they did was agree 
to my request to provide a comparison of the different offers and scheduled a 
follow up meeting for April 10th.

Tetco indicated that they don't plan to make another offer and would not 
agree to entertain counter-offers.  At this point, I doubt that we'll make 
any significant progress and believe that this issue will end up being 
litigated, or at least submitted to  the FERC for a decision.  Based strictly 
on the letter of the Order (or at least our interpretation of it), I think we 
have 

Please let me know if you have any questions / concerns / comments.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Just had a thought, according to Joanies worksheet, we can inject a max of 
1,210,121 into storage for the month of May.  For now, our target injection 
volume in storage for May will be 1,210,121.  When we overinject, like we did 
for the first four days, we need to decrease the volumes on deal 231214 for 
the rest of the month so that the total volume on this deal will be 
1,210,121.

I will try to monitor the deal volume.

Thanks.

What's this - according to Navigator, we only have this contract for 1 day on 
Feb 23rd?  I just entered it in the ces retail sheet.  MDQ = 5000 and the 
rate is $.01?  Who did this deal?

The receipt points are Exxon-Chalkley, NGPL, and Tenn-Egan.   The delivery 
point is Rayne.  It looks like we nominated gas on this contract.  I'm 
setting up this up in Sitara and on our 2000tran02.xls worksheet and I 
entered it in Sitara deal 223022.

Jesse, this will need to be scheduled in Unify.

We have learned the following from a talkative DTI rep:

DTI intends to  modify its existing 637 proposals.  Apparently, in light of 
customer opposition, DTI intends to withdraw its proposal to shorten the 
imbalance make-up period from 20 days to 72 hours and will instead develop a 
new rate schedule for electric generators, who it claims are the entities 
that drove DTI's need to shorten the make-up period in the first instance.

ENA nominated Reliant Energy Field Services contract 96034155 on the third 
party pipe for January business.  This contract is set up with an effective 
date of 02/01/2000 rather than 01/01/2000 in the Global Contracts system.  Is 
it possible to change the date in the Global Contracts system, or should we

Just a note to let you know Columbia Gas has some capacity postings on the 
EBB for next winter.  BIDS ARE DUE 3/15 AT 9AM.
Attached is a spreadsheet showing the parcel numbers.  I highlighted the 
meters that you did not have enough capacity to serve your load this winter.
I would be happy to bid on this as your agent, but let me know what rate 
works based on your economics.  This is a bid process, so the current low bid 
is just an indication of the market value of the capacity.

Chris,

A couple of years ago the East and the Central Desks decided that Empire 
State Pipeline in NY would
be changed from an "East Desk pipeline" to a "Central Desk pipeline" in our 
scheduling and accounting
systems.  The reason for that decision was to fix the significant OA 
variances both desks were experiencing
by the Sithe book liquidations, and to better control and manage all the 
subtle little issues under the gas
sales agreement.  Since the only transaction that was being done on Empire 
was the Sithe deal, this 
approach has worked great and the OA and contract problems have been 
corrected. 

Over the last month or so, Sithe pointed out to us that some days CNG North 
Point gas prices were high 
enough so that Chippawa gas could be shipped over to CNG Lysander and still 
make a margin.  I talked 
to Geoff Storey about it and told him to keep that trade in mind.  At the 
time I assumed that Sithe's IT 
contract would be used to ship the volumes from Chippawa to one of the new 
interconnects with NFGS 
at Pendleton or CNG at Lysander and that we would just schedule it on the 
Central Desk and report the 
transactions under our monthly revenue sharing transactions with Sithe.

If ENA begins shipping gas on Empire under our own agreement, there are a 
couple things that I am very
concerned about:

 o   ENA has a contractual obligation to optimize Sithe's transportation 
assets & to split
       the incremental revenues with Sithe,
 o   Empire desperately wants to Sithe's new 750 MW plant to be served 
through Empire
       and if we start doing alot of IT business on Empire the word will 
probably get back to Sithe,
 o   I hope that Empire Pipeline continues to be a "Central Desk pipeline" in 
our systems.  We can
       not go back to that mess we had before when the Sithe deal was split 
between two desks.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, maybe we can get everybody together 
an make sure that we can
come up with a plan that works for everybody.

Thanks,
Ruth

CNG TRANSMISSION FILES APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE TO BUILD NEW PIPELINE AND
COMPRESSION FACILITIES AS SUBSTITUTE FOR TENNESSEE'S LOOP SERVICE 
  
01/06/2000 
Foster Natural Gas Report 
7 
(c) Copyright 2000, Foster Associates, Inc. 

On December 29 CNG Transmission Corp. (CP00-64) submitted a certificate 
application to FERC
requesting authorization to construct facilities in Pennsylvania and New York 
in order to substitute its own
transportation capacity for market area service entitlements that CNG 
currently holds on Tennessee Gas
Pipeline Co. pursuant to terms of an expiring contract. CNG's contract with 
Tennessee has a primary term
until 11/1/2000 with a one-year notification requirement to terminate. Acting 
quickly on terms of a
settlement (RP00-15) approved by the Commission on 12/21/99, which capped 
CNG's upstream costs
and freed CNG to build its own facilities to replace capacity currently 
purchased from Tennessee, CNG
proposes to construct approximately 13 miles of 30-inch pipeline (TL474x2), a 
loop of its existing pipeline
in Armstrong County, Pennsylvania; to install approximately 13,250 horsepower 
of additional compression
in three Pennsylvania counties and approximately 7,000 hp of compression at 
Brookman Corners Station,
in Montgomery County, New York; to construct and operate approximately 800 
feet of 30-inch pipeline,
known as the Connector Line (TL-510), between TL-474x2 and lines LN-26 and 
LN-380 in Armstrong
County; and to abandon approximately 12.9 miles of a 12-inch diameter 
pipeline in Armstrong County
known as LN-9 (CNG's existing parallel pipeline, LN-19, purportedly is 
sufficient to maintain existing
services to the markets served by this part of CNG's system). These 
facilities are designed to re-create
south-to-north delivery capacity on the CNG system to substitute for looping 
service that has been
purchased from Tennessee.

In support, CNG claims, first, its proposal results in near-term and 
long-term savings to its existing firm
service customers, without degrading service. Second, by not requiring 
assignees to maintain firm
upstream entitlements to service on the Tennessee system, the project will 
reduce the fixed cost burden for
consumers downstream of CNG's LDC customers. Third, CNG's proposal eases the 
constraint for
deliveries on CNG's system from southern receipt points to northern delivery 
points, across the Valley Gate
Junction located in central Pennsylvania. CNG, thus, will be able to 
eliminate its "standing must-flow"
operational flow order. After placing the proposed facilities in service, CNG 
will modify its tariff to eliminate
the requirement that customers with "North of Valley" receipt points -- 
primarily CNG's interconnection with
Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corp. at Leidy, Pennsylvania -- can be 
directed to use their capacity to
tender quantities of gas to CNG throughout the Winter Period. Fourth, the 
proposed construction will
enable CNG to meet its existing market commitments. During the first three 
years after the projected
in-service date of this project, less than 15% of CNG's firm transportation 
capacity will be eligible to expire.
Fifth, to the extent that markets can be served in the future either by CNG's 
own facilities or by the
turned-back capacity that Tennessee accrues in its Zones 3 through 5, the CNG 
construction presents a
competitive alternative. 

Background: CNG's long-haul contract with Tennessee provides for delivery of 
natural gas from the Gulf of
Mexico, plus reliance on an operational loop of CNG's system, operated by 
Tennessee, that allows CNG to
offer more storage and transportation capacity than CNG could provide on its 
own. In the aftermath of
Order No. 636, however, CNG unbundled its storage and transportation services 
and exited the merchant
function. CNG, which no longer required a significant portion of the 
Tennessee capacity from the Gulf to
Tennessee's interconnections with CNG in Tennessee Zone 3, agreed to assign 
its upstream capacity on
Tennessee from the production area to a Zone 3 transfer point (South 
Webster), while retaining the
capacity from South Webster to delivery points interconnecting with CNG in 
Tennessee Zones 4 and 5 to
facilitate dispatching and no-notice service to CNG's customers.

In conjunction with CNG's restructuring settlement, one transaction on the 
Tennessee system thus was
separated into two parts, with CNG and its assignees paying Tennessee 
reservation and usage charges
for the capacity as if Tennessee had a single customer from the Gulf to the 
market area. Tennessee
charged CNG's converting customers the applicable Zone 3 delivery rate for 
transporting gas from Zones 0
and 1 to West Virginia and the South Webster transfer point. CNG, in turn, is 
charged an incremental rate
for transporting gas from South Webster to CNG's delivery points in Zone 4 
and 5, determined by
subtracting the maximum reservation and usage rates applicable to Tennessee's 
Zone 3 (including
applicable surcharges) from the maximum reservation and usage rates 
(including surcharges) for the haul
rate from the Gulf to either Zone 4 or 5. The incremental rate is 
approximately one-third of Tennessee's
maximum tariff rates for Rate Schedule FT-A service from Zones 3 to 5 or 
Zones 4 to 5, respectively.

In negotiations to examine the fate of the expiring contract, Tennessee 
conveyed to CNG that, in order to
preserve revenue neutrality, the assigned upstream contract that feeds the 
CNG/Tennessee market
contract (No. 3919) must match exactly the maximum daily quantity (MDQ) of 
the downstream contract. Any
mismatched quantities will be priced to CNG at Tennessee's maximum tariff 
rates for FT-A service. Unless
CNG were to require all assignees to continue to hold upstream capacity on 
the Tennessee system,
therefore, CNG would no longer qualify for the incremental rate on Tennessee 
on the mismatched capacity
retained by CNG. Meanwhile, as CNG's assignees have elected to turn back 
upstream Tennessee
capacity, CNG's costs would go up unless CNG chooses to turn back an equal 
quantity of service
downstream of South Webster. The cost increase on CNG to its customers, if 
all assignees turned back,
would be approximately $27 million per year.

CNG notified Tennessee on November 1 that it will extend only a portion of 
its current contract for a
one-year period in order to accommodate a new CNG construction schedule. The 
initial termination dates
for CNG's customers' upstream contracts (all assigned from CNG's original 
contract with Tennessee) were
the same. Absent the termination notice, the contract provides for an 
automatic extension for a primary
term of five years.

Proposal to Build Facilities: Given the circumstances, CNG proposes to build 
the facilities needed to serve
its existing market without having to rely on Tennessee for the traditional 
looping service provided under
this contract. Thus, CNG's customers would avoid the anticipated Tennessee 
cost increase that would
result if CNG renewed the contract at Tennessee's maximum rates. Instead, 
CNG's customers will
experience an annual cost decrease as a result when compared to the 
transportation costs approved by
the Commission in CNG's Docket TMOO-1.

CNG proposes to roll the costs of this project into CNG's general system 
transportation rates. Such
treatment, the applicant argued, is supported by the projected cost decrease 
to existing customers as well
as by the system-wide benefits that will result. The benefits outweigh any 
adverse impacts on the affected
interests, as examined pursuant to FERC's policy (PL99-3). No subsidies exist 
under the circumstances,
as the facilities actually will prevent a cost increase to existing 
customers. The proposed construction "also
makes certain cost reductions possible for all of the CNG customers that took 
assignment of upstream firm
services on Tennessee during CNG's restructuring proceeding . . . ." 
Accordingly, CNG has met the
Commission's policy threshold requirement to establish that its project 
satisfies the public convenience
and necessity standard.

Pursuant to the Transportation Cost Recovery Adjustment (TCRA) terms in the 
settlement approved by the
Commission on December 21, CNG will continue to collect its TCRA at agreed 
levels, a specified portion
of which will be attributed to the costs of the project. The annual cost of 
this project to CNG's firm
transportation customers will be $19.8 million, which corresponds to the 
incremental payment that CNG
had been making to Tennessee for Zones 3-4 and 3-5 firm transportation 
services through the TCRA.

CNG related that turnbacks are due to state retail unbundling initiatives 
that reduce the LDCs' need to
maintain pipeline capacity in support of a merchant role. In addition, 
increased liquidity in the commodity
market, largely because of Commission policies supporting market centers, has 
increased opportunities
to purchase gas in the market area. These developments, coupled with the 
potential for significant
fixed-cost savings, motivated CNG's assignees to want to terminate upstream 
capacity contracts.
Therefore, while CNG could have required its assignees to maintain upstream 
Tennessee capacity, the
proposed construction offers a more effective long-term mechanism to enable 
CNG to manage the risk of
future cost increases for its customers.

The applicant said a recognized potential adverse impact on the captive 
customers of Tennessee (who
might face cost shifting) is outweighed by the public benefits of CNG's 
proposal. Moreover, Tennessee
need re-market only a portion of the former CNG market-area capacity in order 
to recoup CNG's
contribution to Tennessee's revenue requirement. Tennessee also has expressed 
confidence in its ability
to secure markets for this newly available capacity.

In order to avoid unnecessary construction, CNG indicated it conducted a 
reverse open season for two
weeks during October, 1999, in which CNG solicited customer interest in 
turning back firm service
entitlements through an announcement on its electronic bulletin board. No 
customer sought to turn back
service entitlements in support of the proposed project. To address potential 
landowner concerns, CNG
plans to construct this pipeline adjacent to an existing natural gas pipeline 
right-of-way, for which CNG
already holds easement agreements. CNG has also directly contacted each 
affected landowner and
secured landowner authorization to conduct both engineering and environmental 
studies on 100% of the
proposed right-of-way.

Steve--who will follow up on this to make sure the Retail volumes get 
booked?  Per Scott's e-mail below, he does want them booked for the remaining 
term.

I definatley think we should book these volumes for all of your reasons below 
plus each month we don't seem to have a decent estimate until the 30th or 
31st.

Scott--
Here is your problem in getting these booked.  You can do what you want, but 
I still think we should book it.  The flexibility in takes is only 10% so 
your flash to actual will not be that great--certainly less than if you don't 
book anything.  Plus, at least if we book something it will be easier to tell 
if they do not take the volumes they are supposed to.  In addition, per our 
discussion with Retail--which Dick was in on that meeting--it is unlikely 
that the sale of the CES-Retail business would occur before September or 
October, which in my mind means it may not be til the end of the year.  This 
would pretty much get us to the end of the deal term.  And finally, what if 
Chris and/or Dick is gone at some point in time--we need the volume info in 
there.

Obviously it is just my recommendation to book it---you can do what you 
want.

FYI,

I talked to Chris and Dick about the issue that the CES index positions are 
not reflected in the books.  Chris was concerned about what (firm) volume to 
book since there is flexibility in the takes.  Also, he said he has a strong 
feeling that CES-Retail may go away in the near future so why book it.  Dick 
agreed that maybe we should not book anything on this right now.  So Chris 
said he will look into this issue early next week and get with me.

Colleen/Chris:  I'm working from memory here, but I'm pretty sure that the 
new Order 637 reporting requirements require the Index of Customers to list 
the primary receipt and delivery points.  However, in checking the FERC web 
site, the pipelines are only required to update the Index of Customers 
quarterly.  Therefore, the indices filed under the new reporting requirements 
won't be out until early October.  I will look into this more closely when I 
get back.

Chris -- Is your Penn Fuel release on Transco or Tennessee?  I couldn't find 
"Penn Fuel" on either the Transco or Tennessee Index of Customers as of 
7/1/00.  Do they have another "legal" name?

P.S.  Here in western North Carolina, the high today was about 70 degrees.  
It's sure going to be rough coming back to 100.  But I understand y'all will 
have a cool spell tomorrow.  It's supposed to be way down to 92!!  We'll be 
warming up to about 72.

Subject: Transco capacity issue

With the change in segmentation rules on Transco, it has become much more 
critical to know the primary receipt and delivery points for the capacity we 
are buying.  Mr. Goodell said that Tennessee's EBB will indicate if the 
points on the capacity you are buying are secondary or primary.  I would 
prefer to know the actual primary points on the contract, especially the 
delivery points.

I just bought some Z6-Z6 capacity from Penn Fuel for the balance of the 
month.  Steve Gillespie verified that Penn Fuel released the primary receipt 
and delivery point on the contract.  But, I'm taking Penn Fuel's word for it 
and I am unable to verify the information myself.  It could have a big impact 
on what we flow in Z6.

Colleen, can we do anything about this through the regulatory process?  Let 
me know if you need specific capacity examples.

                                 JUNE CAPACITY
     The anticipated capacity for secondary and interupptible receipts and
deliveries on our system for June,  2000 has been posted in E-Script.  Notice
that the amount of receipt capacity at our Oakford (Tetco) and Lysander 
(Empire)
interconnects has been decreased.  Oakford has been cut to 150,000 DT and
Lydsander has been cut to 60,000 Dt.


                               STORAGE INJECTIONS

     Customers are urged to review their current storage injections.  To 
insure
you are able to get your storage accounts full by November 1,  it is important
that you maintain uniform injections throughout the injection season.
     Dominion Transmission

?s Rate Schedule GSS,  GSSII or GSSTE  Section 7.4
provides that if Storage Gas Balance is less than or equal to 50% then the
maximum storage injection is limited to 1/180 of storage capacity.   When
inventory is greater than 50%,  then the maximum injection is limited to 1/214
of storage capacity.  In addition, our Tariff allows that customers may over
inject during the summer months as follows:

                      April thru July                 115%
                          August                      107%
                         Sept. thru Oct.          102%
