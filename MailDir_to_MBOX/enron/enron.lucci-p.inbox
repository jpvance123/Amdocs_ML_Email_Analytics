Hello,

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

26 Feb - Leave Dallas around 6:00 p.m. 
26 Feb - Pick up the OKC boys
26 Feb - Drive, Drive, Drive
27 Feb - Rest, Rent Gear, Party
28 Feb - Ski
29 Feb - Ski
1 Mar - Ski
2 Mar - Drive back to OKC / Dallas
3 Mar - Take Day off and rest

The Brazilian ski team will be in town unto the end of the month, so we have plenty of time.

hello!!! 

Ok, I'm going to keep this short (it's after 1:00am Colo time--after 3:00amEST and I've had a few drinks....) but I wanted to try to keep up my unprecedented streak!! Besides, I figure if you're skiing tomorrow, you've bought me another day to respond for real.... 

I'm sooo sorry to hear about all the layoffs, etc. What a mess. There was a sizeable ad in the Journal today for any shareholders wanting to join the class action suit... Then later today, we all got a memo from the firm leadership addressing the comments and perspectives of the big 5 accountancies... crazy. 

Well, hope you made it to the mtns and when reading this are home in one piece! 

:-)

Hello again,

MAN, two emails in just as many days! What's gotten into you, did you fall and hit your head? Anyway I do enjoy them and don't worry I won't hold you to this routine.

No new news to report today, only a list of the casualties; over 5,000 out of 7,500 in Houston and 1,100 out of 1,500 in Enron Europe.....ALL GONE! The people in our London office have the best story so far. They were given their last paycheck on Friday, laid off, and because Enron had arranged for their housing told they would be evicted from their homes in two weeks, and that they needed to find their own way back to the States.(That's a long sentence) Now that's strictly rumor, but that's how we are getting all our information, and it normally turns out to be ture. Unlike all the BS our management is spraying.

So we have been out talking to the local folks about life after Enron. It's actua! lly very promising. I think we can relocate our whole group of 5 pretty easily. In fact we think we have almost 10 job prospects and so far 3 out of 3 would hire the whole group. Two of us are under contract so we can't do anything until they release us but that may be just a matter of time.

I think I'm taking Friday off and going skiing. I bought new skis and just picked them up last night, so I really want to go! These skis are a little longer than I wanted, 190's vs 187's, but what's 3 centimeters anyway. That's a rhetorical question, don't answer that.

I'll let you go for now, but know I want to hear your story. Or at least what your willing to tell.

Paul

Hello,

I ran across you picture and found you to be very attractive, and after reading your "bio" I thought I'd drop you a line.  My name is Paul, I live on the north side of town and work downtown.  I noticed you work downtown? 
Anyway I'm sending you my profile, if there is any interest I'd love to hear from you!

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Marlene,

Thanks for the email.  Ok, I'll tell you more; I'm 36, I live in Broomfield but work downtown.  I'm currently looking to sell my place in Broomfield and move west into the area around Golden.  Maybe Lookout Mountain or Genesee, Broomfield is ok when you're married, which I was for 4 years now divorced two, but alittle far from everything when you're single.  Athletic but only competitive when provoked.  How am I doing so far?

I moved to Colorado from Texas (San Antonio) in 1992, and I don't think I'm going back, although I'm in the energy business which is run primarily out of Houston, TX.  No pets or kids due to the fact that I travel somewhat frequently for my job and pleasure.  Well at least the travel and pets part the kid's part is for other reasons, which I'm sure you can imagine.  I like to ski but prefer the summer better.  And finally, if I get this job I'll work very hard to insure this company remains profitable and loyal to it's customers.  Oh sorry I got off on a tangent.

So now it's your turn, "tell me more."


Paul

Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband wants a threesome with my best friend and me.


A: Obviously your husband cannot get enough of you! Knowing that there is
only one of you he can only settle for the next best thing - your best
friend. Far from being an issue, this can bring you closer together. Why
not get some of your old college roommates involved too? If you arestill
apprehensive, maybe you should let him be with your friends without you.
If you're still not sure then just perform oral on him and cook him a nice
meal while you think about it.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband continually asks me to perform oral sex on him.


A: Do it... Sperm can help you loose weight and gives a great glow to your
skin. Interestingly, men know this. His offer to allow you to perform oral
sex on him is totally selfless. This shows he loves you. The best thing to
do is to thank him by performing it twice a day. Then cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband has too many nights out with the boys.


A: This is perfectly natural behavior and it should be encouraged. The man
is a hunter and he needs to prove his prowess with other men. A night out
chasing young single girls is a great stress relief and can foster a more
peaceful and relaxing home. Remember, nothing can rekindle your
relationship better than the man being away for a day or two (it's a great
time to clean the house too)! Just look at how emotional and happy he is
when he returns to his stable home. The best thing to do when he gets home
is for you and your best friend to perform oral on him. Then cook him a
nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband doesn't know where my clitoris is.


A: Your clitoris is of no concern to your husband. If you must mess with
it, do it in your own time or ask your best friend to help. You may wish to
videotape yourself while doing this, and present it to your husband as a
birthday gift. To ease your selfish guilt, perform oral sex on him and coo
him a delicious meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband is uninterested in foreplay.


A: You are a bad person for bringing it up and should seek sensitivity
training. Foreplay to a man is very stressful and time consuming. Sex
should be available to your husband on demand with no pesky requests for
foreplay.  What this means is that you do not love your man as much as you
should he should never have to work to get you in the mood. Stop being so
selfish!Perhaps you can make it up to him by performing oral sex on him and
cook him a nice meal.





Dear Mr. Abby:


Q: My husband always has an orgasm then rolls over and goes to sleep never
giving me one.


A: I'm not sure I understand the problem. Perhaps you've forgotten to cook
him a nice meal.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.  Copies of the joint proxy statement/prospectus and the SEC filings that will be incorporated by reference in the joint proxy statement/prospectus may also be obtained for free by directing a request to either:  Investor Relations, Dynegy Inc., 1000 Louisiana, Suite 5800, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 507-6400, Fax:  (713) 507-6808; or Investor Relations, Enron Corp., 1400 Smith Street, Houston, TX 77002, Phone:  (713) 853-3956, Fax:  (713) 646-3002.

In addition, the identity of the persons who, under SEC rules, may be considered "participants in the solicitation" of Dynegy and Enron shareholders in connection with the proposed transactions, and any description of their direct or indirect interests, by security holdings or otherwise, are available in an SEC filing under Schedule 14A made by each of Dynegy and Enron.

Hello,

That is except for your religious match, are you really looking for a Buddhist?  Anyway take a look at my profile and drop me a line if there is any interest.  I hope to hear from you soon!

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

I have been in a new position (orientation) for the past 4 weeks, and been VERY busy myself.  How about Thursday or Saturday. The only days Carolyn can't would be Wed.'s  
 I think we should all meet somewhere for drinks and go from there. Please e-mail Tim, and also give me his address for Carolyn.
Let me know what you think so I can at least alert Carolyn as well.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Hi Paul,
I am finally here in Denver. The move was sooo hectic, but I am glad its all 
over with. Unfortuntely, if it wasnt for the job, I would not of moved 
around this time.  Its really weird, that I am away from the family around 
this time.
Hope your holidays are going well.
Marlene

The following is my profile text:

Dear Paul,

Hope you are ok. I keep hearing about Enron on TV and I'm worried for you.
I've had the flu...my first time in 30 years so I'm grounded for a few 
days...It's been warm here....that's the way I like it!! Take it easy...

I spoke to Allie and Jessie..they are cute to say the least.

Love, 
Kay

Mark, pls encourage everyone to talk to their customers today and let's let the street know we are as busy as always and that the overall issues are behind us. I have no new info regarding this matter but believe that the proper vehicles are in place to maintain liquidity.  

I am very interested in what the wholesale customers have to say about our issues.  Do they have a mandate to not trade, are they wanting to turn down their exposures etc. If any customers say this, then let me know.

Pls keep me posted.

Hiya-- 

I don't know who's telling to you tales, but I grew up in a household where my mother's nagging reigned supreme--to the point that it seems like I only respond to nagging!! And as for excuses: damn straight! I love excuses!  

With regard to your header: I'm glad to hear that you're thin,ing of changing it b/c I started to run through the permutations of where you might have been going with that, ie: hung like a horse, etc... not exactly what I think you're trying to convey. Then again, maybe you were... 

Ok, away from that subject... I should have realized that there was a good chance that you work for Enron; what a nightmare! ugh.  Of course, I think there's a good chance they'll hang out in bankruptcy for awhile so hopefully the workforce impact won't be terrible. Although I'm surprised to hear that they're looking at trying to spin your your group off so quickly; those things usually have to get approved by the bankruptcy court and take awhile to go through. In any case, I would like to hear how that progresses... I can't wait to hear the lawsuits against AA. 

Ok, I promised myself I'd aim for > 5 hours of sleep at least one night this week and tonight is it; if I don't end  this I'm going to miss that window, so I'll just say good night.

Hello again,

MAN, two emails in just as many days!  What's gotten into you, did you fall and hit your head?  Anyway I do enjoy them and don't worry I won't hold you to this routine.

No new news to report today, only a list of the casualties; over 5,000 out of 7,500 in Houston and 1,100 out of 1,500 in Enron Europe.....ALL GONE!  The people in our London office have the best story so far.  They were given their last paycheck on Friday, laid off, and because Enron had arranged for their housing told they would be evicted from their homes in two weeks, and that they needed to find their own way back to the States.(That's a long sentence) Now that's strictly rumor, but that's how we are getting all our information, and it normally turns out to be ture.  Unlike all the BS our management is spraying.

So we have been out talking to the local folks about life after Enron.  It's actually very promising.  I think we can relocate our whole group of 5 pretty easily.  In fact we think we have almost 10 job prospects and so far 3 out of 3 would hire the whole group.  Two of us are under contract so we can't do anything until they release us but that may be just a matter of time.

I think I'm taking Friday off and going skiing.  I bought new skis and just picked them up last night, so I really want to go!  These skis are a little longer than I wanted, 190's vs 187's, but what's 3 centimeters anyway.  That's a rhetorical question, don't answer that.

I'll let you go for now, but know I want to hear your story.  Or at least what your willing to tell.

Paul

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

I've consolidated the presentation slides we decided on (and added a few).  It is still very rough and probably too long, but at a good point to dig in and really discuss what we want to say and how we want to say it.

I have been in a new position (orientation) for the past 4 weeks, and been VERY busy myself.  How about Thursday or Saturday. The only days Carolyn can't would be Wed.'s  
 I think we should all meet somewhere for drinks and go from there. Please e-mail Tim, and also give me his address for Carolyn.
Let me know what you think so I can at least alert Carolyn as well.

Hi Paul,
 
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
 
Take care,
Debbe.

Are all the good men REALLY already taken? 
I sometimes think I'm a walking contradiction: I'm feminine but like
being "one of the guys", cynical but trusting, opinionated but
accepting, set in my ways but adaptable, shy but outgoing. I've been
told I'm very "real" -- what you see is what you get.

Steph,

Hey you! Still trying to get in touch with you, it's no big deal, I know you're probably very busy. I know when I'm on the road it's pretty hectic. Or maybe your doing it on purpose to build the suspense. (Just kidding) Here's a thought, I will be passing through DIA tomorrow (Friday) on my to San Antonio for the holidays, schedules permitting, would you want to meet for a quick drink at the airport? I don't know if that's even realistic, just a thought. Anyway my flight is at 4:30 PM, and depending upon security and other issues, I'll probably have time to kill. If you get a chance call me at home (303) 469-6768 or on my cell (303) 810-5708. If you get this message too late have a GREAT holiday and I'll try and talk with you later.

I liked what I read in your profile, but I'm wondering why you didn't include a picture?  I think you have me at a disadvantage.

Hi Paul-- 

Thanks very much for your email!  I would have to say that I'm not an extremist in any sense of the word, so you're pretty safe there... My only potential concern is that I've been described (not infrequently) as being sarcastic and I'm afraid it's a trait that won't change all that easily. If it's not going to be a deal-breaker for you, I'd love to chat. 

Thanks and happy Wednesday!

Hello Again,

Thanks for the email.  I'll try and tell you more about myself.  My name is Paul I currently live in Broomfield but I'm thinking very seriously about selling my place and moving out into the area around Golden.  Maybe Look Mountain or Genesee, Broomfield is ok when you're married, which I was for 4 years now divorced two, but a little far from everything when your single.  Athletic but only competitive when provoked.  How am I doing so far?

Let's see I moved to Colorado from Texas (San Antonio) in 1992, and I don't think I'm ever going back, although I work as a Natural Gas trader for a company that's based in Houston.  No pets or kids due to the fact that I travel somewhat frequently for my job and pleasure.  Well at least the travel and pets part, the kids part is for other reasons which I'm sure you can imagine.  I like to ski but prefer the summer better.  And finally, if I get this job I'll work hard to insure this company remains profitable and loyal to it's customers.  Oh sorry I got off on a tangent.

I've been doing this internet dating thing for a couple of weeks and so far it's been a lot of fun.  I think as long as you take it for what it is; in my case, a way to flirt with pretty girls during down times at work, you can have fun with it.  So far, I've only met one girl in person after meeting her on this service.  We wrote emails back and forth and one night coincidentally ran into each other at a bar. (Little Bear in Evergreen) She actually was very nice but had these hands that were giant, they looked like men's hands and everytime she would touch me I would freak out.  I think she worked in a meat packing plant.  Anyway we hung out for awhile but have not seen each other since.  Thank God because the therapy I would have to go through to get those hands out of my mind would have cost a fortune.  I do have another bad date story but I'll save that one for later.

Now as to what caught my attention, it was your picture!  What are those, Rams?
So now it's your turn, what's your story.  Include all your darkest secrets complete with all your "bad date" stories.

Paul

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

 I think we should all meet somewhere for drinks and go from there. Please e-mail Tim, and also give me his address for Carolyn.
Let me know what you think so I can at least alert Carolyn as well.

Hi Paul,
  
Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be.  
  
Take care,
Debbe.

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Hello,

I was surfing through the pictures on this web site and ran across yours.  I found you to be attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along mine so you can take a look and see if there is any interest.  I hope there is and that I hear from you later.

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Ruth,  Attached is a redline and clean version of the amendment.  I added the language we discussed on the phone.  I also added paragraph and associated changes to make it clear that this pricing doesn't comment until December 1, 2001.

ATTENTION ALL PLANT OPERATORS , SHIPPERS AND NOMINATING AGENTS: 

IMBALANCE PAYBACK GAS AND/OR OVER-DELIVERY RESTRICTION UPDATE 


Due to continuing warm weather and operational issues, PSCo's restriction on imbalance payback gas and/or over-deliveries into the system will remain in affect until further notice.  In order to avoid the need for upcoming weekday and/or weekend OBP's, it is critical that Shippers, Nominating Agents and Plant Operators do not schedule imbalance payback gas or deliver more than confirmed nominations during this period.

Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY during this restricted period.  If over-deliveries become a problem, PSCo will activate flow control valves on any plants involved.

Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback gas to PSCo for the duration of the restriction.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.

Hi - I'll be honest - I thought you were cute.  Hopefully you are as interesting as you are attractive :)  

Take a look at my profile and send me an e-mail if you'd like.  Hope to hear from you!

Click the following link to view the sender's profile:
http://www.match.com/doubleblind/showprofile.asp?UserID=4943474C4B474D&trackingid=0

The following is my profile text:

I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.

Hi Paul,
Well lets see - where do I start- first of all I am in the process of moving 
to Denver- I am still in Scottsdale, AZ. I am moving next week to the 
Littleton area.  It been very annoying to move around this time but I had 
to. I took a position with the Denver Federal Center and they wanted me to 
start asap.  So I decided to make the move!

About me- I am 27 yrs old- very ambitious.  I work very hard but love to 
play hard as well. I feel that lifes to short and to be stressed out is just 
not worth it.  I like to be around professional people but they have to have 
a great sense of humor and like to have fun.  Someone with no personality is 
just not for me!!! I've been told I have a very warm personality- I pretty 
much can get along with everyone.  It surprises people but I never could 
understand that. They usually say that if they didnt know me, thats not what 
they would think.
I actually like to do about anything once.  My philosophy on what I like to 
do is - its not "what" we do its "who" we do it with. I do enjoy very much 
to go out and experience the nicer restaurants. I enjoy the theatre and 
musicals.  I can go on and on....
So if I havent answered your question.  Do ask...
DO you have any other pics to share?
Marlene

Paul, thank you for replying.  I did read over your profile and noticed one
HUGE problem. I am very very sarcastic and you said you didn't like that.  I
am not sure if this was an oversight or you were being sarcastic.  Let me
know for I would be interested any getting to know more about you if we can
get over this technicality.  Talk to you soon.  Christine



Hello,

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time.
I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading
house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in
prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching,
but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or
college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and
doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Hello Paul,

Thanks for your message.  I am just trying to catch up from the holidays.  I was in Steamboat Springs visiting my Aunt and Uncle's ranch with my cousins.  It was a big crew, and fun!  We were snowmobiling and sledding, but didn't get a chance to go skiing.  Hope your holidays were fun.

Hello,

I don't know if you received my first email, but since I'm new to this service I figured I'd write again.  Anyway, I found you to be very attractive and your profile to be interesting.  I sent along my profile so you can get an idea as to who I am.  

I have been divorced for about 2 years and although I don't have any children of my own, I don't have a problem with girls that do!  

I would like to talk to you more, so if you feel the same way drop me a line.  I hope to hear from you.

hiya-- 

Sorry I never sent back the  longer email I said I would... I don't seem to get a lot done these days without a fair amount of nagging, etc. Did you only ski on Friday? Why are you skiing on Thurs this week when you have to turn around and go back to work on Friday? As for Keystone: yuck. I have to say that I would be happy if I never skied at that place again. (I generally don't like the mtn, PLUS it was the scene of the crime re: my knee injury...)  I did make it up last weekend: skied Vail on Sat and it was GREAT. The snow conditions were amazing and certainly the weather was just beautiful. A friend from business school needs to burn a few vacation days so he flew to Denver last night and is skiing today and tomorrow with some random friends from Ft. Collins, then I told him I'd take Friday off and ski with him Fri and Sat. Hopefully it'll be Copper on Fri and Vail on Sat. 

As for the next step... I'm sort of a fan of meeting sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, this weekend is looking a little messy (and yes, I'm in Philly right now, will return tomorrow night, then out again on Sun...)  Maybe we can try talking  in the interim?  My cell # is 720-244-5976 and I'm usually around in the evenings... 

:-) 

Steph 

ps--how were the new skis??  Funny, my new parabolics (ok, really they were new 2 seasons ago, but I didn't ski last year, so they're still new to me... :-)  are 187's. At this rate, I'm afraid I'd actually notice the 3cm difference! :-)

Hey,

How have you been? Are you on the road again? As I said I went skiing last week and the conditions were actually very good. We skied Keystone and although they didn't have the majority of the runs open, the ones that were open were nice. I think I may ski again either tomorrow or this weekend. 
What about you have you skied yet.

So what's the next move with us, are we ever going to talk in person? I'm not sure how you advance in the internet dating scene, any ideas?

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Julie,

Thanks for the email!  I do ski and sometimes even snowboard.  I prefer to ski due to the fact that I'm better at skiing, but normally take the snowboard out once or twice a year.  Do you ski or snowboard?  Judging from your profile I bet you do both.  So you say you have been in town the last 16 months, how do you like it so far?  I'm from Texas, San Antonio, and in fact just came back from visiting my family over the Christmas holiday.  What about you, have you had very many chances to get back home?  South Carolina must be nice this time of year.  I like going back to Texas in the winter; it's the summer that's too hot.

What do you have planned for New Year's.  I have a couple of friends coming into town this weekend and staying through the 1st.  We are planning to ski Vail for the weekend and then party at the downtown Hyatt for New Year's.  I hope we get a few more snowfalls before the weekend.  Vail's nice but the other resorts could use more snow!  I skied Keystone about two weeks back and they didn't have many of the runs open.  I hope that starts to change.

Hey-- 

Congratulations on making the cut (I think!)  Seems like it's a good idea to wait things out through the holidays and the start of the year. I've heard a lot of not nice rumors about more layoffs in January... 

Hope you had a nice weekend. Mine was ok; definitely had better weekends, but suppose I've had worse, too.  Now I'm happily ensconsed in my home away from home, awaiting yet another fun week. 

Happy Monday!

Hi,

I did make the cut, in fact I've got to stay around for awhile and wait and see what Enron has in store for me. I think I'll stay put through the holidays and look to make a decision during the first part of January. It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday, then cold and snowy on Saturday. Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the "prolific" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as "a liquid point of supply," Williams asserted that "presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure."

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., "thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid."

To "further enhance its supply options," the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

"Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers," said the application, adding that Williams was "confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months." With the addition of compression, the project could "facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth," the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to "stagnant to declining supply" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with "projected demand increases." As in many areas of the country, "much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation," it said. The 11,439 Mw of "active winter generating capacity" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four "anchor" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub.

Paul,
 
Attached is a schedule showing what our worksheet amounts came to for the CIG and the PSCo invoicing.  To the right of that you'll see the date we (Nicole or Theresa and Mark or myself depending on which month) agreed on the amount and sent the wire transfer request to our A/P and the date the wire paid.  
 
Some months I sent the Colorado payments to A/P the same day as the Arizona payments and A/P put them together since they were to the same vendor.  Hope this helps.
 
I still maintain that this complete payment review is a separate issue from the LGS/Woodward volumes which you can clearly see that we didn't deduct (the CIG volumes are exactly what we paid) while for the same months you were billing LGS/Woodward for those volumes as well.  Please do everything you can to expedite resolution of this matter and we look forward to working with you on your payment review.
 
Sincerely,

first because I wasn't really gung ho about doing this
- I sort of just filled out the profile and sat back. 
But I think it's actually pretty cool.  I'm surprised
there are so many normal people doing this, aren't
you?  So, what made you decide to do this?  And will
you ever tell anyone that you did/are???

RE:  NOTICE TO CLAY BASIN CAPACITY HOLDERS

Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) is planning to perform Clay Basin inventory verification and deliverability tests beginning April 2, 2002.  These tests will involve a 14-day shut-in of Clay Basin for reservoir gas inventory verification followed immediately by a 2-day field deliverability test. 
D
 uring the 14-day shut-in, Clay Basin customers will not be able to utilize their storage service.  However, in order to facilitate the 2-day deliverability test, an Operational Flow Order (OFO) will be issued and storage capacity holders will be required to take a pro-rata share of their withdrawal capacity from a total volume of 300,000 dth in a 32-hour period.  

Questar will work with storage customers to facilitate transportation of their gas supply during this time period.  Questar is interested in finding ways to minimize the impact of this testing on its shippers.  Please contact your Questar marketing repesentative to discuss the testing process.

This is an alert that FERC will be more critical in the future of negotiated rate deals.  The orders discussed below dealt with buyout provisions in negotiated rate deals that Tennessee, ANR and Columbia had done.  These provisions had previously been permitted as negotiated rates, but FERC has decided that there is "significant potential for undue discrimination" and the recourse rates do not provide an adequate alternative.   Thus, anything in a negotiated rate deal that is not strictly rate-related will most likely be subject to intense scrutiny.

FERC ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO POLICY ON NEGOTIATED-RATE AUTHORITY

Acting on a series of contract-specific cases, FERC last week sharpened its policy on what is, and is
not, allowed under negotiated rates. In further defining its policy, the commission continued to lean
heavily on the "linchpin" of negotiated-rate authority - that a customer not willing or able to negotiate a
deal must always have the option of obtaining needed capacity under cost-based recourse rates.
During discussion of the orders, Chairman Pat Wood III said it was "important to keep in mind, as we
rush into the brave new world on the gas side," that "all customers must be treated on a nondiscriminatory
basis by pipelines." Last week's proclamation should be considered "a reaffirmation of that nondiscriminatory
trend," he asserted.
In representative language, the commission said it wants to ensure that parties "are clear about contracting
practices that we find unacceptable because they present a significant potential for undue discrimination and those
that we find acceptable because they can be permitted without substantial risk" of such unequal treatment.
FERC declared that a "key factor" in determining whether a negotiated provision is considered an
"appropriate material deviation" from a pipeline's filed tariff schedule is the extent to which recourse rates
provide "adequate alternatives" to other shippers.
In cases involving rates negotiated by ANR Pipeline Co. (GT01-25, RP99-301), Tennessee Gas Pipeline
Co. (RP96-312, et al.) and Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. (CP01-70), the commission ruled that the
buyout provisions are not allowed unless they are offered to all shippers as part of the pipelines' generally
available tariffs.
The provisions at issue allow customers to buy out or terminate their contract demand levels prior to
the end of the deals. While the commission previously has held that such provisions can be included in a
negotiated-rate package, "we have reconsidered that holding" because similar buyout opportunities are
not available to more traditional shippers operating under recourse rates, it said in the Tennessee order.
Where a customer is seeking service for a set contract term and quantity, recourse service provides an
"adequate alternative," the commission observed. "However, if the customer desires a special contract
demand reduction or early termination right not provided in the generally applicable tariff, the availability
of service at the recourse rate does not provide an adequate substitute, since recourse service would not
include any such provision." A shipper obtaining such a provision would be insulated from a certain
degree of risk, giving it "an advantage over recourse-rate shippers," the commission pointed out.
"A shipper's right to reduce, or terminate, its contract demand before the expiration of its contract is a
valuable right, since it can enable the shipper to avoid significant liability for future reservation charges,"
FERC said, adding that "such a valuable right must be granted in a not unduly discriminatory manner."
Requiring pipelines to file generally applicable tariff provisions setting forth the conditions under
which they will offer contract demand reduction rights "is the best means of assuring that those rights will
be negotiated" in a fair manner, FERC reasoned. Once approved, the tariff language "will require the
pipeline to grant similar rights to similarly situated customers."
Commissioner Linda Breathitt applauded the policy shift, characterizing it as a much-needed shot in
the arm for a program that had become "muddled." Through a "tortured line of cases," FERC's definitions
of allowable contracting practices were "obscured," Breathitt said in welcoming the new "common-sense"
approach. The "tug of war" that parties have engaged in over the past few years "really hasn't served our
objective of ensuring that nondiscriminatory rates and service" are available to all shippers, she said.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

Hello!
I'm a fun, 33 year old Boulder native, CU grad and work in advertising.  I'm funny, independent and outgoing.  I love my life but desire to have someone to share it with, now since most of my friends are married and starting to have children.  It makes the social opportunities less available and spontanious...I'm sure you can relate.

I love my life and own my own place in Boulder which I share with my adored dog, Buddy.  I'm a huge Buff fan and wish I could go to the Fiesta Bowl for new years.

WHat about you?  WHere did you go to school?  Do you love working in Denver?  The social scene is so great!  Lots to do, great restaurants, fun bars.  I worked there prior to taking my job here in Boulder...I really miss it.

Anyhow, I hope you are having fun and a good repsonse from your ad.  You have a great smile and eyes!  I hope to hear back from you so I can learn more about you!

Take Care,
C

The following is my profile text:

I am a fun, creative, honest, grounded, outgoing Colorado native, CU grad and work in advertising. I love Colorado and enjoy the beauty of my state everyday driving to work looking at the Flatirons. I am lucky to be culturaly diverse and well traveled. Although I am not very athletic, I do enjoy spectator sports but prefer the cultural arts. My friends describe me loyal and true blue.

Hi there -

Thanks for the compliment on the picture.  It's a little unnerving putting a 
digital image of yourself out there and hoping it is a true representation.

So tell me more about yourself.  You must work hard in your job - but what 
else do you enjoy.  Are you skier or mountain enthusiast?  What brought you 
to Colorado?

I love it hear and take advantage of as many activities as I can...

Do you have big holiday plans?

S

Paul,
Hi. I never got your email, but I do remember emailing you. I'm a little 
under the weather today and I am heading to bed. I think I have the dreaded 
winter cold, yuck! I will write more tomorrow, but wanted to let you know, 
that I did get this email. I look forward to talking with you more.
Valerie

Anyway, this is where I compliment you on how attractive you look and how interesting your profile is. (I hope it's working) I've included mine so you can get an idea as to who I am.

The following is my profile text:

Hello, I'm a down to earth person that likes to laugh and have a good time. I work in downtown Denver as a commodities trader for a large energy trading house. I do enjoy my career but understand life needs to be kept in prospective and be balanced. I enjoy activities over sitting and watching, but I have been known to sit in front of the TV and watch football or college basketball all day. I'm looking for someone who enjoys life and doesn't take themselves too seriously.

Hey (insert name here),

Thank you for your response, it's very nice to meet you!  By the way, my name is Tracy or you can call me tp081996, ha ha!  So, what was it about me that caught your attention anyway?

Take care,

Are they going to build it if it is not fully subscribed?  Or is Williams going to take the risk?  I wonder why Entergy is taking space?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

Hey,

Got your email, I'm sorry your weekend didn't turn out as well as you might have expected, at least that's the message I'm getting.  I thought about you this weekend when the weather turned out to be nice, and we had fresh snow on Saturday night.  I hope you didn't get hurt skiing.

I think I'm skiing tomorrow.  There isn't anything going on around here and probably won't be for awhile.  Our boss was here Friday night for our Christmas party.  He thought once everything was finalized we would like this new deal.  So I hope he's right, it's still way too early to tell.

I'll try and call you this evening.  I'm looking forward to the conversation.  Remember keep your sarcasm in check, you know how sensitive I am.

Topics Open for discussion;

1.)  Solutions for solving world hunger
2.)  Is Elvis still alive and if so where is he. (I have a theory or two on this one)
3.)  NSYNC or the Backstreet Boys, which group is more GAY
4.)  Is Britney Spears really Madonna's love child

Paul

I spoke with Dale Sanders at Williams today.  They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Please find the attached draft version of our proposed gas supply structure.  We have focused on minimizing your fixed charges while still giving you the right to call on up to 30,000 mmbtu/d of Firm Cheyenne supplies.  In addition, Enron will manage your transportation and imbalances associated with your PSCO transportation contracts.  Obviously we will need to see those contracts prior to finalizing this transaction in order to assure we can meet those obligations.  In addition, I am sure we will need to "tweak" this proposal to meet you physical requirements (volumes, terms etc.)  Please give me a call once you have had a chance to review the attached.

Hi paul, thanks for the e-mail.  I enjoyed your profile, and was interested 
in what you like to do for fun.  Do you ski or snowboard?  What outdoor 
activities do you enjoy?  A little more about myself:  I am from south 
carolina, and I moved here about 16 months ago.  I am a physical therapist, 
and I work in lakewoood.  I have a wonderful husky named cherokee who joins 
me when I go backpacking, or hiking.  Hope that's enough for now.  Hope to 
hear from you.  Julie.

Paul,

Thank you for taking the time to write.  Sorry I haven't gotten back to this sooner or the few other messages you sent.  I read your profile and you really seem like a great person.  My concern is that I have a cat... that I adore.  Her name is Missy and she was my Mom's. I have been taking care of her since my mom was in a fatal car accident two years ago and love this cat to pieces.   Sorry... I don't know if you are allergic or like some folks who just simply  don' t like cats... but she is part of my world and rock's it.  

If you don't mind my saying so... you should get a close up of your eyes... they are "beautiful!"  I know my picture is kinda blurry and I have no room to talk about picture quality... but you need to get up close up of those babies, "WOW!"  I don't mean to sound too flirtatious,  I just wanted to extend you a compliment where it is due.  What is the background behind you in the picture????

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.  "Be Safe!"  
~ : )

Steph,

Hey you!  Still trying to get in touch with you, it's no big deal, I know you're probably very busy.  I know when I'm on the road it's pretty hectic.  Or maybe your doing it on purpose to build the suspense.  (Just kidding)  Here's a thought, I will be passing through DIA tomorrow (Friday) on my to San Antonio for the holidays, schedules permitting, would you want to meet for a quick drink at the airport?  I don't know if that's even realistic, just a thought.  Anyway my flight is at 4:30 PM, and depending upon security and other issues, I'll probably have time to kill.  If you get a chance call me at home (303) 469-6768 or on my cell (303) 810-5708.  If you get this message too late have a GREAT holiday and I'll try and talk with you later.

Paul

Hi,

Thanks for the email.  Glad you enjoyed my profile.  I'd like to hear more about you!  So, are you a Colorado native or did you move here from someplace else?  How do you like working downtown?  I live in Wash Park and currently commute to Boulder 3 times a week where I work for a software company so I'm quite envious of you!  Do you have any plans for the holidays?  I'm headed to warm, sunny Florida to visit my family in West Palm Beach.  Must say I'm looking forward to it!  I leave tomorrow but I'll be taking my laptop with me and will be doing a little work/checking emails while on the road.   Are you a skier/boarder?  If so, have you gotten out yet this year?  I've been up to Breckenridge a couple of times already and it was pretty fun but I'm really hoping for some major snow storms in January! 

Well, have a good Thursday and I hope to hear back from you soon!  

Take care,

Christie

The following is my profile text:

Hi! My friend's have described me as cute, intelligent, fun loving, outgoing, happy, easily amused, intuitive etc...etc...!  I love to read, hike, ski, hang out w/good friend's eating good food & drinking good wine!  I love to laugh & I love being around people who make me laugh.  I love the outdoors & I love the ocean.  My favorite things are weekend getaways, moonlite walks, good conversation, & having time to spend at the Tattered Cover (I often loose track of time there).  I love most kinds of music except for heavy metal...which I don't consider to be music!  One of my dreams is to have a house on the beach & one nestled in the mountains.  My mountain house is going to be the location of some wonderful, cozy, holiday parties!  I am into health & staying healthy, I work out & try to stay in shape!  The Boulder Boulder is my favorite annual event, (but please don't ask me my time!!) it's more for fun & fame (ha ha!!)

Hello Again,

I do ski and sometimes even snowboard.  I haven't been up very much this year but I think things are about to change.  What about you, are you an extreme skier?

I'll be going to San Antonio (TX) for the holidays.  My folks have a small ranch outside Kerrville in what they call the "Hill Country."  It's actually pretty nice.  I hope the weather is good.  South Texas isn't all that bad in the winter....it's the summer that's hell!  What do you have planned for the holidays?  Where are you from?

I'm taking off for the airport.  Drop me a line and tell me how you're doing.  Have a GREAT holiday and let's talk soon.

Paul

NOAA ANNOUNCES NEW "ENVIRONOMICS" PROGRAM THAT 
LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's "Environomics" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, "Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past."
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.
NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources.

The following is my profile text:

I would describe myself as extremely comfortable with who I am, mostly because I have an unsually close family. Most people can't believe how non-dysfunctional we are. I guess that is why I have managed to stay single so long. I am not in a hurry to rush into something just because it's the thing to do. I like sports both spectator and participation. Av's. Broncos, Pioneers etc. I really could do without the Nuggets and Rockies, even though I was mesmerized by the World Series this year. I like to bike, ski, golf etc. I read a lot, but it goes in spurts. I'll read three books in a week and then wait 3 weeks to pick up another book. I love to cook. I would like someone who can go out and mix in a lot of different situations, or hang out at home, and do absolutely nothing.

Hey-- 

Well, as far as I know, the phone number works! :-)  Talking next week would be fine. I'll be back in Philly as of Sun evening. ie: EST, 2 hours ahead of Denver :-) 

I'm not sure if I should be offering my congratulations or not, you failed to mention whether you were one of the 3 who made the final cut... regardless, you sound like you're hanging in there. 

I'm sitting in the airport, on my way home and thrilled to be doing so. 

Talk to you later!

Hey,

Thanks for the phone number, I hope it works! It's a little crazy for me this weekend also. Why don't I call you during the first part of next week and see if we can set something up. What time zone will you be in?

As far as the job goes, three in this office made the final cut. So we are waiting around for our next set of orders. I'll explain more later. Take care.

Latest NFL Player News

Freddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
San Diego Head Coach Mike Riley said Monday that he is optimistic Jones
will be able to play Sunday. He has been sidelined by an ankle injury.

Wade Richey, K SD - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Richey is likely to lose the starting placekicking job with the Chargers if
they sign Steve Christie to a contract. San Diego would shift Richey to
kickoffs only, after he missed two short field goals Sunday to drop to
21-for-30 on the season. In that case, you should drop Richey from your
roster.

Steve Christie, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Chargers are expected to sign Christie on Tuesday provided he passes a
physical, according to the <I>San Diego Union-Tribune</I>. He would handle
the field-goal chores for the remainder of the season, with Wade Richey
shifting to kickoffs. If you're a Richey owner and need a kicker, Christie
might be worth a pickup based on past history, but don't expect him to be
one of the better kickers in the league even if he does get the starting
job.

Mark Brunell, QB JAC - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
Brunell is questionable for Monday's game against Green Bay, the third
straight week his status has been in question due to continued pain in his
quadriceps muscle. He will be limited again in practice, and it's probably
a good idea to keep him on reserve for Week 12 in your league.

Terrell Davis, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
Davis should be able to return from arthroscopic knee surgery in time for
Sunday's game against Miami. He will practice this week before a final
decision is made, but we're skeptical the Broncos won't have him split
carries with Mike Anderson, limiting both players' Fantasy values.

Keith Poole, WR DEN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Poole has bruised ribs that will likely keep him on the sidelines for
Sunday's game against Miami. If he can't play, Kevin Kaspar would start in
his place, and the Denver passing game would further suffer.

Rod Smith, WR DEN - Blue Balls Updated 11/27/01
Smith now has two sprained ankles, and is questionable for Sunday's game
against Miami. If he can't play, then the Broncos might have to start Kevin
Kaspar and Chris Cole at wideout, depending on Keith Poole's recovery from
a rib injury.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/27/01
Jackson's ankle remains sore, and he will be re-evaluated Wednesday to
determine his status for Sunday's game against Tennessee. Benjamin Gay and
Jamel White would continue to split carries if Jackson can't go.

Neil Rackers, K CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday he has not yet made a decision
on the status of Rackers, who missed two field-goal chances Sunday. He is
9-for-18 in field goals this season, and Jaret Holmes has been on the
practice squad since Nov. 1. Rackers will likely retain the job for
Sunday's game against Tampa Bay, but he's a very risky Fantasy starter
based on his struggles.

Akili Smith, QB CIN - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Bengals Head Coach Dick LeBeau said Monday that Smith might be promoted to
No. 2 quarterback, according to <I>The Cincinnati Enquirer</I>. "If that's
what they're going to do, maybe the Bengals need to get rid of me," Smith
said, citing a desire to be traded if he's used in a mop-up role. He's not
a recommended Fantasy choice, although it's important to note that he's now
likely next in line if Jon Kitna gets hurt.

Terry Allen, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/27/01
Allen, who remains out with a broken hand, could return to the lineup on
Dec. 16. With the Ravens losing Jason Brookins to an injury, don't be
surprised if Allen takes back the starting job once healthy. Hold onto him
if you have the room on your reserve list or play in a deeper league.

Moe Williams, RB BAL - Texas Terminators Updated 11/27/01
Williams becomes the Ravens' featured back after the injury to Jason
Brookins. If you play in a deeper league or are desperate for a running
back, consider picking up Williams, although you shouldn't expect him to
post great stats unless the matchup is very favorable.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Results of X-rays on Brookins' foot revealed a fracture of a bone in his
small toe, which will sideline him for at least four weeks and possibly the
rest of the season. Moe Williams becomes the Ravens' starting running back,
and might be worth adding to your roster in a deeper league.

Wayne Chrebet, WR NYJ - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Chrebret did not practice Monday because of a shoulder injury. However,
<i>The New York Newsday</i> reports that he is expected to play in Sunday's
game. 

Jake Arians, K BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Arians has been released by the Bills. Buffalo has signed Shayne Graham to
replace him. 

Edgerrin James, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
Colts coach Jim Mora said James' surgery to repair a torn ligament in his
left knee was successful Saturday in Miami. Mora said he received the news
from orthopedic surgeon Dr. Arthur Rettig, a team physician. "I spoke with
him Saturday and he told me it went very well," Mora said. James, the
two-time NFL rushing champion, injured the knee when he was tackled
awkwardly late in a game at Kansas City on Oct. 25. He was placed on
injured reserve last week. James' rehabilitation is expected to take seven
months. He is not expected to take part in either of the Colts offseason
minicamps. Team president Bill Polian has not said whether James will be
ready for the start of training camp. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/27/01
Glenn could be put on injured reserve if he doesn't recover from a
hamstring injury soon. That would mean the end of his season, and perhaps
the end of his Patriots career. "I haven't reached it yet," coach Bill
Belichick said Monday when asked when he would decide if the roster spot
would be better spent on someone other than Glenn. "But as each day goes
by, it gets a little bit closer." 

Shayne Graham, K SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
The Buffalo Bills signed Graham as their kicker Tuesday, a day after Jake
Arians was released following a missed point-after against the Miami
Dolphins. Graham had been released by the Seattle Seahawks before the start
of the season. 

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Alexander, who has been hampered by a ankle injury, returned to action on
Sunday. He didn't start, however, and may lose playing time to both Walter
Rasby and Zeron Flemister for the rest of the season. Unless you play in a
deeper league, dropping Alexander is advisable.

Az-Zahir Hakim, WR STL - Luccis Losers Updated 11/27/01
Hakim, who is dealing with an ankle injury, played in Monday night's 24-17
loss to Tampa Bay. He had three catches for 29 yards in the game. 

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/27/01
Barlow suffered a dislocated shoulder during Sunday's win over
Indianapolis. "It's throbbing," Barlow told the <I>Contra Costa Times</I>.
"I couldn't really sleep last night. I had to sleep sitting up. It's
hurting." Barlow is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game against Buffalo,
so be sure to place him on reserve. 

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/27/01
Owens suffered a sprained right foot on Sunday to go along with his
sprained left ankle. X-rays were negative, but Owens' foot was placed in a
protective boot as a precaution. He is expected to miss some practice time
this week, but he will be in the starting lineup on Sunday when the Niners
face Buffalo. 

Jeff Thomason, TE PHI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Thomason suffered a hyperextended knee during Sunday's loss to Washington.
He missed practice on Monday, and is status for Week 12 is uncertain at
this time. The reserve tight end has very little value as a Fantasy player. 

Donald Driver, WR GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Driver, who has been inactive for three straight weeks due to a thigh
injury, returned to practice on Monday. His status for Week 12 remains
unclear, but he's not worth starting on your Fantasy team in any event. 

Tyrone Davis, TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Davis, who has been out all year due to a hamstring injury, will likely
find out what his status with the Packers will be this week. Depending on
his health, the team will either activate him, place him on injured reserve
or cut him altogehter. 

James Stewart, RB DET - Orange Roughy Updated 11/27/01
Stewart, who suffered a neck stinger in last Thursday's game against Green
Bay, is expected to be available for Week 12. He'll have a tough time
posting good Fantasy numbers against Chicago's tough run defense, but the
lack of depth at running back in the league makes it tough to bench him. 

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
According to the <I>Detroit Free Press</I>, Batch is expected to start
Sunday's game against Chicago despite a groin injury. "This is Charlie's
offense," coach Marty Mornhinweg said. "He practiced a little bit
today...he was in all weekend getting (the injury) treated...I would expect
him close to full speed Wednesday." He'll likely lose snaps to rookie QB
Mike McMahon, however, so starting Batch is a risky proposition. 

Jackie Harris, TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Harris missed last week's game against Denver due to a hamstring injury.
The veteran tight end is listed as day to day. 

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/27/01
According to coach Dick Jaroun, Thomas' status for Week 12 is still
uncertain. In fact, the Bears don't expect to know if Thomas, who is
dealing with a hamstring injury, will be available until later in the week. 

Brad Hoover, RB CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Hoover (neck) will likely be held out of practice this week. However, the
Panthers are hopeful that he'll be available for Sunday's game against New
Orleans. 

Chris Weinke, QB CAR - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/27/01
Despite his inconsistent play and 14 interceptions, Weinke's job as
Carolina's No. 1 quarterback is secure. "There've been quarterbacks who
have gone on to be very successful that have gone through times like this,"
coach George Seifert told the <I>Charlotte Observer</I>. "Even though there
are a number of these plays that haven't turned out and there have been
disruptions in his play, I think, ultimately, it will be more beneficial
than not." While he may be the starting quarterback in Carolina, Weinke
isn't worth a roster spot in most Fantasy leagues. 

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/27/01
Sanders, who left Sunday's game against San Diego due to nagging hamstring
injuries, is questionable for the Cards' Week 12 matchup at Oakland.
However, he is optimistic that he'll be available for the game. "I'll be
there," Sanders told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "They're just real sore
from doing a lot of running and jumping - normal wear and tear." In any
event, keeping Sanders on your bench may be a good idea against the tough
Oakland secondary. 

Rob Moore, WR ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/27/01
Moore (hamstring) was supposed to begin some light running last week, but
he ended up doing nothing of the sort. "He hasn't made a lot of progress,"
coach Dave McGinnis told the <I>Arizona Republic</I>. "We're going to come
to a point where we're going to have to make a decision." Moore, who has
missed the entire season due to injury, could be placed on the injured
reserve list this week. 

Olandis Gary, RB DEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/26/01
The Broncos placed Gary on injured reserve Monday, and signed Karon Coleman
to the active roster. This officially ends Gary's season, as he suffered a
broken leg on Thursday. Drop him from your roster.

Daunte Culpepper, QB MIN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/26/01
Culpepper sustained a contusion on his left knee in the second half of
Sunday's game against Chicago, but remained in the game. He did not throw a
touchdown pass for the first time this season, however, and has been very
inconsistent all year. Don't be surprised if Culpepper continues to
struggle if he doesn't get 100 percent healthy from this injury by Week 12.

Charlie Batch, QB DET - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/26/01
It is unclear who will start at quarterback for the Lions on Sunday against
Chicago, as Batch is still sore from strained groin muscles that limited
him on Thursday. Mike McMahon has been getting most of the playing time
when Batch can't go, but the Lions' management might start Ty Detmer due to
the tough Bears secondary. We don't recommend any of the three for Week 12.

Quincy Carter, QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01
The Cowboys announced Monday that Carter will replace Ryan Leaf as their
starting quarterback for next Sunday's game against Washington. Carter
started the first game of the season for Dallas, and is 10-for-24 for 38
yards and no touchdowns on the year. We don't recommend him in any league
this season.

Anthony Thomas, RB CHI - President Taft Updated 11/26/01
Thomas, who missed Sunday's game against Minnesota with a pulled right
hamstring, hopes to return next Sunday against Detroit. Keep an eye on his
progress during practice this week before you make a final decision on him.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/26/01
Sanders is expected out five-to-seven days due to a nagging hamstring
problem that limited him to the first two series of Sunday's game against
San Diego. Check back on his status before making a final decision on him
for Week 12.

Jeff Graham, WR SD - Really Rottens Updated 11/26/01
Graham suffered a bruised thigh in Sunday's loss to Arizona. His current
status is day to day.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/26/01
Brookins may miss the rest of the season with a broken foot. Baltimore will
elevate Moe Williams into the starting role and use fullback Obafemi
Ayanbadejo as a backup.

Kevan Barlow, RB SF - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/26/01
Barlow dislocated his left shoulder Sunday. His status for next week has
not been determined yet.

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/26/01
Jackson re-aggravated his ankle injury on Sunday. His current status is day
to day.

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/26/01
Warrick is listed as questionable for Sunday's game against the Buccaneers.
He was taken for X-rays on his injured shoulder in the second quarter of
Cincinnati's Week 11 loss to the Browns.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/26/01
Kitna will keep the starting job for the Bengals despite being benched at
halftime against the Browns. He was replaced by an ineffective Scott
Mitchell, who was then lifted for Akili Smith late in the game. None of the
Bengals' QBs are worth using in Fantasy leagues right now.

Keenan McCardell, WR JAC - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards against Baltimore. He has
certainly raised the level of his play in recent weeks, and should be a
solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents continue to focus on
Jimmy Smith.

Stacey Mack, RB JAC - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk
because of his inconsistency. 

Qadry Ismail, WR BAL - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite his quiet
statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any Fantasy
team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in the AFC.

Jason Brookins, RB BAL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Brookins rushed for 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a
fumble. The rookie RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter
on most teams right now.

Ron Dayne, RB NYG - Texas Terminators Updated 11/25/01
Dayne carried the ball six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend
on him for good numbers during the remainder of the season.

Tiki Barber, RB NYG - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, and caught five
passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although his owners would
still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.

LaDainian Tomlinson, RB SD - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Tomlinson was held out of the end zone, but he had a good day against
Arizona nonetheless. The rookie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including
13 receptions, in San Diego?s 20-17 loss. 

Doug Flutie, QB SD - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Flutie had a solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against
Arizona. However, he?s only worth starting when the matchup is to his
advantage. 

Jake Plummer, QB ARI - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Plummer had a decent outing on Sunday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown
against San Diego. Plummer, who also threw two picks, is only a reserve
Fantasy quarterback at best. 

David Boston, WR ARI - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
Boston had another outstanding game, catching six passes for 121 yards and
a touchdown against San Diego. He?s one of the most reliable Fantasy
receivers in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. 

Willie Jackson, WR NO - Texas Terminators Updated 11/25/01
Jackson had a good outing against New England, catching five catches for 78
yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy receiver,
but he is worth starting in deeper leagues. 

Joe Horn, WR NO - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes for 97 yards against
New England. He?s been a very dependable receiver in recent weeks and is
worth starting on a weekly basis.

Tyrone Wheatley, RB OAK - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley carried the ball five times for
17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often in short-yardage packages, and
Wheatley does not appear capable of starting for any Fantasy team in the
near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he may not be able to take many
carries away from Charlie Garner.

Antowain Smith, RB NE - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Smith had 153 yards of total offense and two touchdowns against New
Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has become a pretty good weekly option
for Fantasy Footballers

Tom Brady, QB NE - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, posting 258 yards passing
and four touchdowns. He?s become a pretty reliable Fantasy player, and his
performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Patriots? bench for
another week.

Rich Gannon, QB OAK - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the
Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the
most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.

Frank Sanders, WR ARI - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggravating a
hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not return to
the game.

Eric Moulds, WR BUF - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Moulds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196
yards and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners
should still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the
year. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a
mediocre performance.

Alex Van Pelt, QB BUF - Luccis Losers Updated 11/25/01
Van Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one
interception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long
as he remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.

Oronde Gadsden, WR MIA - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did not catch a TD
pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable to start for
most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.

Jay Fiedler, QB MIA - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs and no interceptions at Buffalo. His
performance may have quieted talk of a QB controversy, but Fiedler is still
too inconsistent to be a dependable Fantasy QB.

Donovan McNabb, QB PHI - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
The Redskins held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no
TDs or interceptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from
such a quiet performance.

James Thrash, WR PHI - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Thrash caught four passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too
inconsistent to be a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs
approach. 

Rod Gardner, WR WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Gardner caught four passes for only 33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has
slowed down considerably in the past few weeks, and now seems like a risk
during the Fantasy homestretch. 

Ki-Jana Carter, RB WAS - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Carter saw extensive action on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back
problems. He carried 18 times for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if
Davis in on your Fantasy team. Davis has always been known to battle minor
injuries.

Isaac Byrd, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Byrd started in place of the injured Muhsin Muhammad on Sunday. He posted
decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absence, catching five passes for 69
yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta. 

Muhsin Muhammad, WR CAR - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Muhammad missed Sunday's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His
status for next weekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.
He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy
disappointment if he stays healthy.

Chris Chandler, QB ATL - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Chandler had a subpar game on Sunday, throwing for only 132 yards against
Carolina. The Falcons chose to attack Carolina with their ground game,
which was the reason for Chandler's poor Fantasy numbers. 

Derrick Alexander, WR KC - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Alexander caught two passes for 56 yards in his return from a rib injury.
He was not open often, and Alexander may continue to be a Fantasy
disappointment if he stays healthy.

Bob Christian, RB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Christian had a surprisingly strong game on Sunday, posting 122 yards of
total offense and a touchdown against Carolina. He may be worth a roster
spot in deeper leagues, but don't expect these type of numbers from
Christian on a weekly basis. 

Dominic Rhodes, RB IND - President Taft Updated 11/25/01
Rhodes had a solid game against San Francisco, posting 147 scrimmage yards
and a touchdown. Look for Rhodes to be a dependable Fantasy player for the
remainder of the year. 

Priest Holmes, RB KC - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Holmes rushed for 120 yards and caught three passes for 70 yards against
the Seaahwks, but both of Kansas City's TDs were scored by other RBs. You
can depend on Holmes for fine yardage totals down the stretch, but he will
continue to lose carries to Tony Richardson and other backs in the red
zone.

Peyton Manning, QB IND - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Manning had 374 yards passing and a touchdown against San Francisco, but he
also threw four interceptions. The Colts' quarterback is definitely having
a down year, but it's still tough to bench a guy with as much potential as
Manning. 

Koren Robinson, WR SEA - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Robinson caught three passes for only 29 yards at Kansas City. A week after
catching his first pro TD, Robinson has reverted back to being a mediocre
Fantasy player.

Terrell Owens, WR SF - Team Chick Updated 11/25/01
Owens came up huge for San Francisco once again, catching six passes for
103 yards and a touchdown against Indianapolis. He may very well be the
best receiver in Fantasy Football at this point. 

Garrison Hearst, RB SF - Really Rottens Updated 11/25/01
Hearst had 106 yards rushing and two touchdowns against Indianapolis on
Sunday. Hearst has had three consecutive solid weeks, and is proving his
worth as a Fantasy player. 

Derrick Mason, WR TEN - C-Dawg's Boyz Updated 11/25/01
Mason compiled seven catches for 114 yards against Pittsburgh on Sunday.
He's been a pretty reliable Fantasy player in recent weeks, especially now
that the Titans are throwing the ball more on offense. 

Shaun Alexander, RB SEA - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
The Chiefs held Alexander to 43 rushing yards, but he did manage to catch
six passes for 62 yards and a TD. Even if opponents manage to stop him on
the ground, Alexander can still be a threat as a receiver on flat and short
passes.

Steve McNair, QB TEN - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
McNair put up 334 yards passing and three touchdowns (two passng, one
rushing) on Sunday against Pittsburgh. He's been surprisingly solid in
recent weeks, especially when Tennessee is behind late in the game. 

Plaxico Burress, WR PIT - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Burress had a great game against Tennessee, posting eight catches for 114
yards and a touchdown. He may not be a highly dependable Fantasy player,
but he's worth starting when the matchup is right. 

Kordell Stewart, QB PIT - Team Dick Updated 11/25/01
Stewart had another big game, posting 254 yards passing and two touchdowns
against Tennessee. "Slash" also had 54 yards rushing and a touchdown, and
seems to have established himself as a decent option for Fantasy owners in
recent weeks. 

Kevin Johnson, WR CLE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/25/01
Johnson had a huge game on Sunday, catching six passes for 113 yards and a
touchdown against Cincinnati. He has been Cleveland's most reliable
receiver this year, and has become a pretty dependable Fantasy player. 

James Jackson, RB CLE - Uran Man Updated 11/25/01
Jackson started Sunday's game against Cincinnati, but complied only 40
yards rushing. Coach Butch Davis also used Benjamin Gay and Jamel White,
which seriously effected Jackson's Fantasy numbers. 

Freddie Jones, TE SD - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Jones has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against Arizona. He has
been dealing with an ankle injury in recent weeks that still needs time to
heal sufficiently. 

Cameron Cleeland, TE NO - Luccis Losers Updated 11/25/01
Cleeland has been declared inactive for Sunday's game at New England due to
an ankle injury. Look for Boo Williams to start in Cleeland's absence once
again. 

Terry Glenn, WR NE - Grid Iron Goons Updated 11/25/01
Glenn has been declared inactive for Sunday's game against New Orleans. He
has been dealing with a hamstring injury in recent weeks, and could be in
jeopardy of missing the remainder of the season. He may be placed on
injured reserve if he doesn't practice this week.

Jon Kitna, QB CIN - Blue Balls Updated 11/25/01
Kitna was benched in the third quarter of Sunday's game against Cleveland.
Kitna (8-of-19, 85 yards, two interceptions), was replaced by backup Scott
Mitchell, who promptly threw three interceptions of his own. 

Steve Smith, WR CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Atlanta in the third quarter with an
apparent shoulder injury. However, he returned to action later in the
quarter. 

Peter Warrick, WR CIN - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Warrick left Sunday's game against Cleveland in the first half with a
shoulder injury. He was taken to the locker room for X-rays, and did not
return to the game. Warrick finished the game with only one catch for 22
yards. 

Maurice Smith, RB ATL - Dont Mess Updated 11/25/01
Smith left Sunday's game against Carolina in the first half with an
apparent ankle injury. He was replaced by Rodney Thomas for a few series
before returning to the contest late in the second quarter. 

Stephen Davis, RB WAS - Houston Big Ballers Updated 11/25/01
Davis left Sunday's game in the first quarter with soreness in his back. He
was replaced by Ki-Jana Carter and returned in the second quarter after
going to the locker room for an examination.

Frank Wycheck, TE TEN - DRock's Beaatchs Updated 11/25/01
Wycheck (calf) is expected to start against the Steelers. He has been
cleared to play.

Darnay Scott, WR CIN - Orange Roughy Updated 11/25/01
Scott (ribs) will play against the Browns on Sunday after a problem-free
pregame workout. He did not practice during the week.

Stephen Alexander, TE WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01
According to published reports, Alexander will play on Sunday, but will not
start. Walter Rasby is expected to be Washington's No. 1 tight end.

Hey, its Katie.  You answered my personal ad, sorry it took so long to get back!

Well, I am sitting at home doing nothing.  I don't know if you are
interested still, or if you found someone so I don't want to write much.  I have been playing on my web cam for a few days.  If you want to chat with me, I'm usually online after work.  You don't have to have one, but it makes it more fun.  I'll still talk to you, though if you don't.  Here is how you can get a hold of me. 
http://www.katieshomepage.com/webcam
There is a thing on there that tells when I'm online.  Email me if you have any problems.  We can chat on AOL the old fashion way if this doesn't work out.
Have a fun weekend!
Katie

Northern Gas Company is requesting a letter proposal for peaking gas for
December 2001 through February 2002.  This proposal could be for the Casper
Pooling point #18106 or any other mutually agreeable points into NGC's
system.  The volumes should be a max volume of 15,000 to 20,000/d.  NGC
would like to receive this proposal by November 7th and we will notify
suppliers on November 9th or 12th.  If you have questions let me know.
Thanks, Lorraine
