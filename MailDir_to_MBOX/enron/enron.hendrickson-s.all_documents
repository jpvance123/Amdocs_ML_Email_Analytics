Ok, I tried and tried to figure out how to keep the pictures attached in
this program and CAN'T!  Will you please forward for your dumb old mom those
pictures that you sent out of the house to the list above?  I know that you
are busy, just whenever you get a chance.

Love,
Mom

PS Kimme wants to see the ice skating one with Tory and Armin too.

Hey guys!  It's been a long time, I hope everyone is doing well especially 
since I know it's the end of bid week and it's Friday.  Just thought you 
might enjoy some of the things I've learned since I've been here about the 
English language.   Hopefully they'll give you chuckle.  

There are differences between British English and American English that I've 
noticed so far:

Pants are "trousers."  Don't make the mistake that I did:   I wrote, "Black 
Pants, Brown Pants, Khaki Pants" on my dry cleaning inventory to turn into 
the dry cleaners and got reminded that I was turning in "trousers" not pants 
with a smirk.  "Pants" are what they call underwear here.  Also, I almost 
fell over in my chair laughing one day when a girl in my group said "PANTS!" 
and hit her hand on the desk when her computer crashed.  Apparentely, it's 
the equivalent of saying "CRAP!"

I went to the grocery store around the block and I was looking to buy some 
orange juice.  On the outside of some of the containers it said "with extra 
bits" and some said "no bits."  I was puzzled until my boyfriend explained 
that it was "with pulp" or "without pulp."  

When I go to restaurants I have to remember that fries are "chips" on the 
menu (even at McDonalds), and chips are called "crisps."  If you want to get 
a baked potato it's called a "jacket potato."    And if you want mashed 
potatoes, just say "mash."  One of the favorite dishes at the pubs (not bars) 
here is "bangers and mash" which translates to sausages links and mashed 
potatoes.  

Here are a few more of the oddities:

You don't stand in line here, you "stand in queue."
Trash cans are "bins."  It's amusing to hear someone say, "I don't want it- 
just bin it."
Country boy or redneck types are called "wide boys" or "barrow boys."
When you spell things out loud, Z is pronounced "zed" and H is pronounced 
"haitch."
Cross walks are "zebra crossings"  since they are signified by white stripes 
on the road.  (Pronounced ZEB-bra, not ZEE-bra)
Panty hose are called "tights" regardless of their thickness.
Good  is pronounced "goote."
Yards no matter how big or small are all called gardens regardless of the 
fact that they're not growing any vegetables in them.

Well, I guess that's about it for the English lesson for today.  I hope you 
are all doing great and I'll try to do better about sending updates.

Cheers!  ( "Thanks")
Angie

The status is DEAD!  Armin hasn't even had time to approve bills.  And it
totally screwed up my printer when I messed with it.  It will be several
weeks before Armin will have time to look at it.  We have so many jobsites
going right now, it's incredible!  He starts running at 6 and doesn't stop
until 11pm.  I'm sure it is easy to someone that understands what the hell
the computer is saying, but even Armin is not sure about the german version
of what the computer is saying.

How is Bean?  Did his eye get ok?  Does he stay outside all night alot?  And
he doesn't bark??? to come in??

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the 
Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of 
MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and 
outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each 
message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and 
inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following 
attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, 
*.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these 
e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how 
to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful 
e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down 
time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or 
malicious code.

Subject: Cute story


Anyone who's been single and over the age of 18 can relate to this.

When I was younger I hated going to weddings ...it seemed that all of my

aunts and the grandmotherly types used to come up to me, poking me in the

ribs and cackling, telling me, 'You're next.'

? They stopped that crap after

I started doing the same thing to them at funerals.

If you yelled for 8 years, 7 months and 6 days you would
have produced enough
sound energy to heat one cup of coffee
(Hardly seems worth it)

If you farted consistently for 6 years and 9 months, enough
gas is produced
to create the energy of an atomic bomb
(Now that's more like it)

The human heart creates enough pressure when it pumps out to
the body to
squirt blood 30 feet
(OMG...!)

A pig's orgasm lasts 30 minutes.
(In my next life I want to be a pig)

A cockroach will live nine days without its head before it
starves to death.
(Creepy)

(I'm still not over the pig)

Banging your head against a wall uses 150 calories an hour.
(Do not try this at home .. maybe at work)

The male praying mantis cannot copulate while its head is
attached to its
body. The female initiates sex by ripping the male's head
off.
("Honey, I'm home. What the....")

The flea can jump 350 times its body length. It's like a
human jumping the
length of a football field.
(30 minutes...can you imagine??)

The catfish has over 27,000 taste buds.
(What can be so tasty on the bottom of the pond?)

Some lions mate over 50 times a day.
(I still want to be a pig in my next life ... quality over
quantity.)

Butterflies taste with their feet.
(Something I always wanted to know)

The strongest muscle in the body is the tongue.
(Hmmmmmm........)

Right-handed people live, on average, nine years longer than
left-handed
people do.
(If you're ambidextrous, do you split the difference?)

Elephants are the only animal that cannot jump.
(OK, so that would be a good thing....)

A cat's urine glows under a blacklight.
(I wonder who was paid to figure that out.)

An ostrich's eye is bigger than its brain.
(I know some people like that.)

Starfish have no brains.
(I know some people like that too.)

Polar bears are left-handed.
(Who knew...? Who cares!)

Humans and dolphins are the only species that have sex for
pleasure.
(What about the pig?)

Dear Scott,

Are you set for Christmas?  Where are you spending the holidays?

Our roof party went great!  The weather was good, no rain and the sun was out,
it was just a little too windy.  But we were grilling in our private garage,
which is opened only to the North and the wind comes from the West and South.
Every seemed to enjoy the party, lots of beer, sekt, and wine was had by all
(that seemed to warm them all up too)  And most all of the bratw_rst and bread
was eaten!  Angus managed to stay warm and dry until the last 30 minutes.  We
had had a lot of rain, which left a lot of deep mud puddles where the trucks 
had
been driving on the land.  He suddenly showed up in the garage totally soaked!
Looks like he jumped and missed the land, landing in a puddle that was like a
lake to him!  I had brought a large thick cloth bag for him, I knew somehow 
he'd
manage to be in the mud...so I bagged him up and put him in the truck until we
could get him home and washed.  We now have a Christmas tree on our roof of 
our
house...looks neat!

Friday, we layed sewer pipes (in a drizzling rain) for the rainwater.  It runs
down the gutters then into the pipes buried in the ground, until it reaches 
our
huge rainwater reservoir under the warehouse.  (Water is very expensive here,
just for our little garden and apartment, the bill was 2,500 DM for the year.
Soon we will be watering an acre!)  The gutters were working just great too!  
It
was quite a muddy river down in those ditches where we were laying the pipe 
with
all the rainwater coming off the roof onto us.

Well it is finally cold here, REALLY COLD!  Looks like our winter has arrived.
At least most of the windows are in the house, all in the office and 
warehouse,
the final tiles should be on the roof be the end of tomorrow (but the roof is
closed with wood) and best of all the HEATING IS WORKING IN THE OFFICE and
breakroom!

Yesterday we celebrated our one year anniversary for our civil service wedding
by working somemore on our building.  We took bratw_rst, bread and wine and
grilled out in our utility room!  We then dined in the breakroom, while 
sitting
on a big bundle of styrofoam in front of the radiator.  It was really nice,
there's actually a great view out that window overlooking the rolling fields
(that are still GREEN!).

Then for the evening we went to the Christmas market in our town and dined at
the Rathaus (the restaurant acrosse the plaza from the actual Rathaus that we
married in...Rathaus means, government building...Courthouse).  To tell you 
the
truth, A?mann's is better, but they are closed on Sunday evenings.

Melissa and family are all set to be here next weekend.  Can't wait to see 
them!
 We finally got our tree finished yesterday morning.  Armin was being 
extremely
difficult about the lighting on the tree, but he finally got lights (after
buying 4 different sets) that pleased him, so I then decorated.  I have to 
admit
he does now have the best possible looking lights, even if the tree had to sit
there for 3 weeks while he searched the stores!

We hope you have a nice easy week and a great Christmas vacation!  I have a
confession to make, since I have just realized that I have not mailed my
Christmas cards...it looks like I may not get that done this year, please
forgive me!  I hope to do better in the future.  It is still so difficult for 
me
to function in this tiny apartment, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE OFFICE AND HOUSE TO 
BE
FINISHED!!!!

Take care!

Connie, Armin and Angus

Lesson Number One

A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day.
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him, "Can I also sit like you and

do nothing all day long?
The crow answered: "Sure, why not." So, the rabbit sat on the ground
! below the crow, and rested. All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on
the
rabbit and ate it.

Management Lesson: To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting

very, very high up.

Lesson Number Two

A turkey was chatting with a bull. "I would love to be able to get to
the top of that tree," sighed the turkey, "but I haven't got the energy.
"Well,
why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.
"They're
packed with nutrients." The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found
that it
actually gave him enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree.

The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.

Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of
the tree.
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the

tree.

Management Lesson: Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep

you there.! 

Lesson Number Three

When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to
be Boss. The Brain said, "I should be Boss because I control the whole
body's responses and functions." The feet said, "We should be Boss as
we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go." The
hands
said, "We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the

money."
And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes until
finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the
asshole
being the Boss. So the asshole went on strike, blocked itself up and
refused to work. Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands

clenched, the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the
brain fevered. Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be
the
Boss, so the motion was passed. All the other parts did all the work
while the
Boss just sat and passed out th! e shit!

Management Lesson: You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole
will do.

Lesson Number Four

A little bird was flying south for the winter. It was so cold, the Bird
froze and fell to the ground in a large field. While it was lying there,

a cow came by and dropped some dung on it. As the frozen bird lay there
in
the pile of cow dung, it began to realize how warm it was. The dung was
actually thawing him out! He lay there all warm and happy, and soon
began to sing
for joy. A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow
dung, and
promptly dug him out and ate him!

Management Lessons:

1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut.

Yeah, I finally got your birthday message last night.  Figured you were
partying!  So what did you and Julie do over the weekend?  Were you batching
it?

We're doing fine.  Armin has his first boondoggle this week, ski trip to
Switzerland.  Not bad for his first.  I'm missing him already, we haven't
been apart for over 10 hours in 2 years.  weird, but I can't get enough of
him!

Well gotta go work some now...write me!

Ok, i tried all day yesterday until 8 pm.  I was hoping that armin would
have some time to look at it with me last evening, but he was too busy with
work, so I went home.  I tried again today..no luck.  Maybe I have a
firewall or something?!?!? you know I hate this kind of crapppp....it all
should just WORK!

We had snow again this morning, but not too much, looks like someone
springled powder sugar on everything.  I'm ready for that to stop.  But at
least I didn't have to scrap ice off the car this morning!  I wish I had
just one of the garages at the apartment that I have here!  I think You
could easily park 10 cars in the warehouse!  I push the button drive in and
do circles!  But Armin will soon fill alot of it up with that work stuff of
his.  He has my private garage full of insulation AND the automatic opener
isn't installed yet...he has sooooo many projects to do!!

I have a wonderful husband but I have the MOTHER IN LAW FROM HELL!!! She has
pissed everyone off so bad that she can't find anyone that will except a
vacation in Greece with her.  Everyone that she has taken, she has worked
them to death and NO ONE is willing to go with her again.  I can't begin to
tell you how trully horrible this woman is!  And the worst part is... IT'S
ARMIN'S MOTHER!  It makes him so sad that she is so terrible.  Do you have
any in law problems?  Do they know you and everything?  I sure wish I didn#t
know mine.  Or they could just move permently to Greece, that would be good.
Do your parents know Rayfael?  How are you parents?  Please tell them hello
for me!

Well, gotta work some more!
later,
Connie

I can't believe you're going to put them outside!  100% of the TIME?  That
would be soooo difficult to do, I would end up letting them in, I have no
discipline when it comes them, with their sweet, sweet faces!  I do think
you are getting paid back for your lack of understanding for Barbara, it's
terrible when those kind of things come back to haunt you.

Which house is for sale, John's? Or that woman that never came outside?  Did
I tell you that they raised my tax value on the Roseland house for 2001 to
$231,000...what a joke!!! I#m sure that the purchaser will contest and win,
he only paid 190,000 and that is the fair value.  Are prices going down in
Montrose, what's the problem with the house by you, why isn't it selling?  I
would love to be able to buy a place that cheap...my land here cost $300,000
US!  The house alone here will be another $300,000 when it's
finished...incredible.  Armin has a small one bedroom apartment that he paid
$150,000 US for and we checked into selling it, evidently he bought when
prices had peaked...we'd get have that for it if we sell...so I guess we are
staying in the landlord business for now.  We just signed a new tenant, hope
she's not a problem, the others we've had were no problem.

I'm really sorry about the dog situation.  But what else can you do.  Oh,
what we do for love and lust!  I left everything and moved to Germany and
you're throwing your dogs outside.  Life has it's difficulties!

How's your mom?  What#s happening with MDAnderson?

Per Men's Fitness magazine Houston is the FATTEST city in America.  This 
seems counter-intuitive since we have the second largest gay population.

Also there is a new product soon to hit the market - satellite radio, where 
you can receive numerous channels of commercial free music (like on Direct 
TV) anywhere you drive your car in the US for $9.00 a month.

Well we have had our first accident at the new building...But it really wasn't
the building's fault...Armin and Lolo worked all evening installing the 
largest
of our 3 garage doors on the warehouse.  It's a really tall and wide door, so
that large trucks can pull all the way into the warehouse to unload.  Well, 
all
went well with the installation, and it was time for them to go.   Lolo closed
and locked the garage door while Armin loaded up his work truck to leave.
When Armin slammed the sliding side door shut, he somehow forgot to let go
with his left hand...so the door slammed shut with his fingers in it.  That's
not the worst, Armin had locked the door before he slammed it shut!  It was
locked with his fingers smashed inside!!!  That's STILL not the worst!  He had
already cranked the truck, so the keys were in the ignition on the oposite 
side
of the truck from where he was trapped!!!!

Thank GOD LOLO HADN'T LEFT YET!!! He got the keys and unlocked the door, 
freeing
Armin's smashed 3 middle fingers.  If he would've been alone there, as he
normally is late at night, it would've been terrible!!!

So he came home around 10:30 PM in shock with pain.  He took aspirin and was
finally able to sleep about 1 AM.  This morning he could move them, but they 
are
swollen and purple and very painful.  Of course, he won't go to the doctor, He
says that they aren't broken ? ? ? But he is in a lot of pain.  He must have
been terribly tired to do something so stupid.  He needs to take a break, but 
he
won't...hopefully when Melissa and family get here he will slow down.

Hope you all are having a safe week!

Connie

Dear Rayfael-

I did get in contact with the head of our research group today and passed 
along your resume.

For your information, his name is Stinson Gibner (a really nice guy) and his 
phone number here at work is 713-853-4748.  He is the Vice President over the 
group and sounded interested in talking with you.  He said that he would call 
you and set up an "informal" talk.  The next step would be to come in for the 
formal interviews, which Scott can tell you how much fun that process is!!  I 
would suggest that you follow up with Stinson in a couple of days if he has 
not called you by then.

The entry level job in Stinson's group for someone with your level of 
education is called a Sr. Speicalist.  The pay range for this job 
classification is $41,300 to $87,600.  At this level you could come in and 
learn the financial side of the business which will help you to progress 
through the job hierarchy.

I am glad to have gotten something productive done today.  After being gone 
for a week it was a big fat mess in my office today.  To top it all off, I 
had to wait at home for over two hours for the police because my house was 
burglerized while I was in New York last week!  They just took a couple of 
rings from my jewerly box (nothing big), but they were from my trip to 
Cartegena, Columbia and cannot be easily replaced!  It's always something!!

Oh well,

Hope you have a great evening...

Julie  :-)

I know I'm a little late, but the wishes were there for you when we toasted in
the New Years here!

We got Melissa and family off to the airport yesterday morning, then headed 
into
the office for our 1st day as business owners...I won't even go into how bad
that afternoon was, I don't have the energy right now.  But even when things
were at their very lowest, and GOD KNOWS THEY WERE!! there was a wonderful
silver lining, NO IT'S A GOLD/DIAMOND LINING!!! Claudia!!! She is the greatest
maid/cook on the face of this earth!  I came home to a beautiful spotless 
house
yesterday and to a great cooked meal today and ALL I HAD TO DO WAS GO TO
WORK!!!! Can't beat that!  I don't have to tell her anything!  She#s been
feeding me for over 5 years, so she knows just what and how I like stuff and
she's an immaculate housekeeping!  To top it all off, she's good company too,
a real cut up.  Can't wait until you get to come taste her cooking!

But things aren't looking good for getting the house finished for April.  We
have so much work with the business right now that Armin doesn't know how he
will have time to work on the house.  We are really lucky, alot of companies 
are
in bad shape because they have no work, and the business comes first.  He is
making time to get the office finished.  Tonight Lolo, Mitch, and J_rgen are
helping him.  The painter is to come Fri morn then hopefully carpet the next
week!  I have reached the TOTAL EXPLODE STAGE WITH BOTH HIS PARENTS.  Like I
said I can't even go into right now....

So what all did you do over the holidays?  We had a really nice time with
Melissa and family and they did make it home ok this time.  We had snow, so 
Tory
was happy.  But today it warmed up to 50F??? Weird weather.

Write when you can!
Connie

That I am my friend, still smackin' the goods to the company's elite!! 

Didn't ECT go out of bizness a few years back?

I moved over here last month after much soul searching and a little divine 
intervention; I got out while the gettin' was good (and there was still 
something to get out of)   Remember, there are no layoffs in the Champagne 
Room...
  
So now I'm toiling away on the power desk, Commodity Risk Management to be 
exact.  Currently, I take the wholesale curves and massage them to  capture 
more of the physical risk associated with the retail bizness (cong., losses, 
ancillary etc.)  A commercial role no doubt!!  And last week I learned how to 
schedule power in California--take that to the cocktail party and stretch 
some honnies yessir!!  i thought the'd never give a brotha the busbar...

BTW--either you are really early for Easter Bunny decorations, you've 
expanded on your rainbow welcome mat, or you are seriuosly remiss about the 
Christmas decorations (or worse, a party I missed inviting myself to?!)  
What's up with that?  How is everything else going?    How's Julie these days?
Did you ever get those peppers to grow?  God be willing, I'll have some 
chilis, serranos, and habaneros to trade this summer.  Aye Poppeeee!
Anyway, keep in touch, with others that is.

 Organization Announcement (Correction) 

I apologize for the confusion and inconvenience my mistake caused.  I had 
indicated that Kenneth Lovejoy would be supporting EES, but this is not 
correct.  Ken will be supporting  OEC.  Corrected announcement is provided 
below. 

 It is my pleasure to announce that Kenneth Lovejoy has joined Enron Corp. 
EH&S Asset Operations.  He will be reporting directly to Donnie Willmann and  
will support Central America, Caribbean and OEC.  Ken has over 25 year 
experience in environmental, health and safety for the oil and gas 
industry.   He has been working for Enron since 1996 and has extensive 
international experience.    We are excited to have Ken in our team so, 
please welcome Ken in his new role.

Well our first week in our new office has been quite an experience.  Armin
is only in the office late at night, so I am up here on this hill all alone
during the day, just me and Angus.  On Monday a man came from some
department of the government to "control" the office... he wanted to check
that we have everything required by law for our employees.  Since only the
office is finished he kindly said he would come back in the fall, he was
very nice.

On Tuesday another man came from the government, once again to "control" the
employees, same kind of stuff as the 1st man, just another branch of the
government.  Since only the office is finished he kindly said he would come
back in the fall, he was very nice too.  Both of these men showed me ID,
even though it meant nothing to me.

Then on Wednesday, there was loud knocking on the office door and I walked
down the stairs to see about 15 MEN CONVERGING ON MY WHOLE BUILDING!  They
were all dressed in plain clothes, jeans and stuff, and had arrived in
several dark colored cars and a white van.  I opened the door and some of
them came in.  The one in charge spoke to me but I only  understood the
words customs and control the employees!  They were looking everywhere and
looking at me quite strangely.  I was very uncomfortable not know WHO OR
WHAT they were.  When the leader realized that I spoke better English than
German, he spoke to the others.."ENGLISH!" and then another one came from
the rear and began questioning me in English.  He wanted to know where the
employees were, if I was alone, what I was doing...he then realized that
there was a business working out this building and asked if it was mine, I
QUICKLY said NO, IT'S MY HUSBANDS!  He then wanted all the details about our
buisness, what we did, how many employees etc.  I was so puzzeled and he
could see it.  They all started smiling at each other then just said, this
IS your address for the buisiness, Schleehofstr. 14?  I said yes and he said
OK, fine.  Then, they all packed up and left.

I didn't see or talk to Armin until he came home for lunch.  I explained to
him what had happened and he was shocked too.  He said that's never happened
to his business before.  Then the more we talked about it, it began to
become clear what they had really been there to do and why.  Our building
looks and is still very much under construction, even though no one but me
is working here right now.  But the company that built the structure still
has their mobile office here and their workers meet here each morning before
going in company trucks to their new jobsite, leaving their autos out front
on the street.  The men had been with the german immigration police.
Someone must have called in that there were illegal aliens working at this
address!  When they arrived they saw all the cars and came in to carry off
any illegals in there van that were working on the jobsite, they really had
no interest in our buisiness or employees!  So yes, I got raided on my 3rd
day here in our new office.  Armin said that they should have shown me some
ID and never open the door again unless I see ID...LIKE GERMAN ID IS GOING
TO MEAN ALOT TO ME THRU A GLASS DOOR?!?!?  What an experience.

So how's things going with you?  I got the aol thing and will try to get
that set up.  But mostly when you are online at your house, I'm asleep.
Write when you can!


Connie

Yes, the business address is what you should use during your morning hours.
When I go home for dinner each day I check the home one then and then again
normally before bed.  But I am here at the office MUCH more than at home.
We love our office!  We have so much room and it's OURS!

About the phone number, ISN'T THAT STRANGE?? You can have a number that is 5
digits or alot more!  I don't understand how this system works in Germany.
OUr main number is area code 931 then
991191-0, we then also can have  any number between 991191-10 and 991191-50
in our system.  Our apartment number is only 97753, 5 digits??? Can you
explain it to me?? Armin can't.  But I think all handy's have the same
number of digits, 11 and no area code...i think.  I don't think anyone has a
number with less than 5 digits.

My office email experience hasn't gone without some gliches.  I told Armin
that something really strange must be going on because I was getting emails
from some of you and not from all of you.  I told him it seemed like some of
my emails were, in fact, MUST be missing.  He blew me off like I didn't know
what I was doing (which is mostly correct).  BUT that's beside the point,
then last night after dinner he confessed that his office computer was
probably taking my emails before I got a chance to download them!  The
thief!  So if I seemed to be ignoring some of your emails that's because I
wasn't getting them.  Armin had his on automatic download, I made him turn
that off...THIS IS MY TURF!  Now I will received all emails first.  Write
me!

I gave up on the messenger thing.  The msn totally screwed up my
computer..it said I didn't have enough space or something like that then it
sent a print job to my computer that printed 40 pages with 1 or 2 symbols on
it.  It's over.  Armin will have to work on that shit.  When he has time and
is back.

I can't tell how big the house is right now.  I thought it looked small from
the inside, but I thought that about the office too and now that it's
finished I realize that the office is 2 x's as big as the one at the
Scharnberger's..it's huge.  I think the house is a little bit less than
3,000 sq ft of living space, mostly on the ground floor.  Remember we have
an acre of land to fill up.  But when you stand inside it doesn't seem big
at all!  On the ground floor is the master bedroom/bath, guestroom/bath,
foyer (and it IS HUGE), kitchen, dining, living room, utility room and walk
in pantry.  The second floor has a bedroom/bath, archive file room, and a
galary (that's what's behind most of the windows on the second floor).  The
rooms are not big (I don't think).

Now the warehouse IS BIG.  I drive my car in there and do circles.  But
Armin will eventually fill it up.  The I will use my private garage, it's
big enough for a work truck and my car.  Just want it all finished!!!!

 I am now the proud owner of 4 doors and 2 EVEN have door handles and
LOCKS!!! I can actually go to the bathroom in private now.

Bad news is, it's raining again. AND the farmer just spread liquid manure on
the field beside our office.  At least the rain should help keep the smell
down, I guess???

Hope your having a good week!

Subject: photos from Egypt


Dear Mom, uncle lex and bruce,
   Hi from a chilly rainy Istanbul. Yes, I am back to
the land of no sun- very overcast. Sunlight was so
nice in Egypt. I can hardly believe I was in Cairo
just a few days ago.
   Had a good day back at work. I was complemented in
front of my peers for my work on the web site- my
journal excerpt and the photos. Everyone is pretty
impressed. Nice to get positive feedback. My job
doesn't provide a lot of that. (Have ya'll seen the
slide show and read my journal on the through the Isik
web page? I sent out a mass mailing a while back with
a link to it)
    I forgot about a conference I am presenting at is
this very week! I am presenting with three female
teacher friends (two other Americans, one turk). I
wrote a long poem for my part and tomorrow we do a run
through in front of our peers at Isik. Anyway, I am
off to Ankara hopefully on the romantic luxurious
night train Wednesday evening, probably express bus
back for Saturday night. WIsh me luck.
    Nice to get back to my routine. Picked up the
Michaelangelo book again at the gym and made a big
salad.
  I love you all- gillian

Well, not everything, but we were able to get 2 chairs, a desk, our computers,
the fax and printer out of her office.  She wouldn't let us take any of the 
rest
of the furniture...BUT THAT'S OK!!!! We have all we need to work out of the 
new
office!!!! IT'S SO GREAT>!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Our new telephone number will be working maybe even this evening!  Lolo and
Armin are still working on it.  I help Lolo pull the last cables thru this
evening.  Now he JUST has to connect all those pretty colored wires!  I gave 
out
an incorrect number, (I think) before.  Our main number will be 0931 9911910 
and
my desk will be 99119119...I think.  Too many 1's and 9's, but I like it 
anyway!

Tomorrow I will start scrubbing out all of the file cabinets, that are all so
filthy...then I will start to unpack the files.  During that time, I hope Lolo
and Armin have all the technical stuff working!!!

HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND!  And that you are as happy as we are right 
now!!!

Connie, CFO
Firma Scharnberger

I just tried to enter all my email addresses into the office computer.  This
is a different program than I had used at home and I am guessing as to what
I am doing????  IF you receive this email, will you please answer back so
that I know if I was succesful with not only entering the correct addresses,
but also in sending this email.

THANKS!  HOPE YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY!  connie

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp,lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp,lia  tells the story of 
a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, 
captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric 
toymaker Dr. Copp,lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing 
human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre 
performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp,lia to the 
people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the 
seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are 
available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 
713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied 
seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) 
are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of 
performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre 
ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp,lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th,atre Imp,rial de 
L'Op,ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L,on and music by L,o 
Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving 
as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early 
nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the 
turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, 
critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as 
follows: "Copp,lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. 
But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its 
historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's 
prologue."
Copp,lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a 
staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp,lius), 
and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet 
ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet 
premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking 
d,cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would 
be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking 
new production of Copp,lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and 
musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater 
stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp,lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the 
second-act depiction of Dr. Copp,lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on 
display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the 
rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the 
eye-popping toys featured in  the workshop are a huge astrologer with a 
pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with 
a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a 
trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the 
back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the 
costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully 
picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

That's terrible about your mom.  It sounds like she will have a very rough
road ahead.  I am so sorry.  We will be praying for her.  It must be
terrible too to have to wait to get into MD Anderson.  Please give her our
best and keep us posted, I am not familiar with that kind of cancer.

I'm glad you were a winner in Vegas.  When's your next trip?  We arrive in
Houston on July 4th, then go on the family vacation July 9 - 15 and depart
Houston on th 18th.  We were hoping to get together with you all the friday
after the 4th (the 6th??, I think).  Just let us know!

We have just spent the whole morning trying to install the wiring in the
walls of the break room for the internal vacuum system.  You have to run the
wires thru the plastic pipes that are in the walls and sometimes, like today
they just want go...so Armin had to destroy some of the wall.  It should
have only been an hour job, but it turned into 5 hours!  All of our workers,
except Claudia are on vacation this week, so we are trying to get some work
done on our house.  there's so much work and sooooo little time.

Now it's time for lunch...write when you can!

Connie

Well, Armin made it back all in one piece from his ski trip.  He said that
it was a good trip, but the sun didn't shine the whole time.  He said that
the hotel was full of Americans!  And that most of the service people in the
area were either Canadian or American.  They didn't even speak the language,
only english...which is no problem for Armin now.  (The language in
Switzerland is supposed to be german so he was ok either way!)

He brought back a brochure, but forgot to take the camera.  It looks
beautiful!  We all have to go sometime...even the brochure was in german and
english.  It was just 6 hour drive from here too.  Of course, It was only
like 4 to Austria and I liked it really well and it was cheaper.

We had a blizzard here while armin was gone. About 1 foot of snow in 24
hours.  Angus and I made a snowman bottom.  We couldn't pick up the second
ball to make a man.  I have never seen snow stick like this did.  I made a
small ball with my hand at the table in the garden and rolled it up to the
door and back (that's like a total of 12 feet)...there was nothing but grass
left where I had rolled it and the ball was bigger than I could reach
around!  I hope that was the last snow of the year!  I'M READY FOR SUMMER
AND VACATION!!!

Hope you all had a great weekend!

Love,
Connie, Armin and ANgus

The objective of this program is not to teach you how to do a deal, but 
rather, to give you a better understanding of how basic financial principals 
contribute to the structure of a deal.    It will also provide you with 
insight to Enron deals in order that you can make a contribution to the work 
that goes into putting one together.

When you leave the program, you will have:

R An understanding of basic financial and accounting issues relevant to 
Enron's transactions.
R A basic understanding of how Enron structures deals - the "deal space" and 
how the financial principals discussed  relate to  Enron deals.
R The ability to take the financial principals and apply them to an Enron 
deal.

Haven't heard much from you..are you vacationing???  Are just having a big
Valentine's celebration?  I'll be lucky if I get to see my husband for
Valentines!  But I did get roses...from the HOUSEKEEPER!  She's so sweet.

Well the "Control" police hit me again today...but this time only one.  He
was checking out our german workers, to see if they were "illegals".  It's
so funny, they KNOW I'm not german, but there never question my legal or
illegal status.  It's because I'm American.  If I spoke with an Eastern
Europe accent, they'd be all over me.  Prejudices are world wide.
Obviously, there are either toooo many of these police or tooo little work
for them to do to keep bothering me.

So what's your Valentine plans???

Well, how was your weekend?  Sunshine?  MUST BE NICE!! We still had cold,
rainy weather all weekend, but today we have SUNSHINE!!! AND our workers are
actually installing OUR plumbing!  AND we are taking a TRIP!!! They say good
things come in 3's, so I guess I have gotten my allotment.  Armin booked us
on a flight to London for Friday morning, returning Tues night.  We are
going to stay with Heather.  This is our first trip anywhere since the
wedding last May.  Since she hasn't been there but a few weeks, we can take
in all the sights together.  Now just have to find a dog sitter.

Armin and J_rgen installed all the electrical for the guest room and 2 doors
in the breakroom and bathroom over the weekend, so finally we are
progressing on the house...THANK GOD!

Well, can you believe it...my Melissa is 24 today.  incredibly.  And Tory
will be 6 on Sat! They are all doing good still, I am so happy for them that
things have worked out so great.

How is it going with your Mom?  Any luck with MD Anderson yet?

Well, gotta run...we are picking up some more doors this afternoon.

The winds have shifted and all the smoke from the fires is hitting
Orlando today.  It makes it nasty to be outside.  I'm sure glad we had
none of this over the weekend!

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate 
the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the 
systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups 
necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market 
opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk 
groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, 
structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and 
back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these 
services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice 
President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the 
Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will 
continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice 
President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the 
Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim 
Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while 
ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading 
organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don 
on their new roles.

I am pleased to announce that iBuyit Payables has been activated for all 
organizations supported by Houston Accounts Payable.  iBuyit Payables is an 
innovative tool that will enable us to code and approve invoices for goods 
and services online.

Who is impacted?
Beginning today, all coders and approvers of invoices that were previously 
submitted to Houston Accounts Payable for processing and payment, will code 
and approve invoices through iBuyit Payables.  Invoices entered directly into 
SAP, will not be impacted by this process.

Note:  Beginning May 8th, any invoices with coding sheets received by 
Accounts Payable will be entered into iBuyit Payables and electronically 
routed back to the coder. The invoice will then need to be coded and approved 
(again) in iBuyit Payables to generate a payment. 

How do I receive training?
Online system demonstrations and quick reference cards are available on the 
Enron intranet in the Integrated Solutions Center Document Library at <
http://sap.enron.com/sap_doclib/user/file_list.asp?cabinet_id=265>.  
Note:  You must use the Enron standard Microsoft Internet Explorer to view 
these materials.

Who do I call for help?
*  For help using the iBuyit Payables system, contact the ISC Call Center at 
(713) 345-4727.
*  For invoice payment status, contact the Accounts Payable Call Center at 
(713) 853-7127
 or toll free at (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to 
iBuyit.payables@enron.com <mailto:iBuyit.payables@enron.com>.

Questions?
For general information about iBuyit, send an e-mail to <

Well, I am in shock about Frank...I just NEVER would have thought it of him.
Did Susan say how Karen is doing?  Is she working again?  It really makes me
sad when things like that happen.  Why can't people just keep their
commitments, why does it hardly ever work out that people stay together
anymore...like our parents did...

How's your mom doing today?  Is she still in shock?  Please keep us posted
on how things are going for her.  We will keep her in our prayers.

Write when you can,
connie

PS What does Susan and Renato think about what Frank has done???

I have returned from Egypt. We had a great time. The weather was great and
the tour was well organized. But, it is good to be back. I will write more
later. They missed me at work it looks like I will be busy for a while.

Dear mom, Bruce, and Unlce Lex,
   Greetings from an overcast and chilly Istanbul. It
is Sunday afternoon and I am back safe and sound. I
hope Bruce your travels went well.
   Yesterday morning I took a cab to the Islamic
museum and it was indeed as good as I had hoped- and
empty & cheap to boot. No problems with our Hashem
(our agent) picking me up and transferring me back to
the hotel and then the airport. I met Brandi in the
waiting lounge and it seems she too had the same
distressing reports about Doing Egypt on your own on
the cheap. She was harrassed a lot (sexually and
otherwise) and generally felt lost and unhappy a lot.
I think we definitely made the right move to do it the
way we did.
   My flight was uneventful and her boyfriend met us
at the airport and had gotten us a ride home. I had a
great homecoming. My good friend Christine from
Ireland came over and we went to a fun party given by
a gay Brit friend last night- home after 2pm!
   I got up and went to church and it was nice to see
friends there. Afterwards coffee with my friend Terry
and then shopping and relaxing here. My home is fine
and Sultan is happy to have me back. What a super
vacation! I am relaxed and energized. Have already
done a load of laundry and soon will do yoga.
   Great to hear from you mom from the boat and hope
you have a great time. Nice that you arrived to find
flowers from the Millers. Enjoy!
    Bruce I suppose you could copy this letter to send
on to mom. I assume you got the same email I did from
her on the boat.
    I love you all- gillian

In order to do something semi-Easter related, we have brunch reservations
at 11:30 am on Sunday at Commander's Palace in the Aladdin.  Jim will
already be gone, but I think everybody else will still be around.  I took
the liberty of making the reservations, because it will probably fill up -

>From the Birmingham Sunday Mercury (7th Jan 2001)
  Worker dead at desk for 5 days

  Bosses of a publishing  firm are trying to work out why no one
  noticed that one of their employees had been sitting dead at
  his desk for FIVE DAYS before anyone asked if he was feeling
  okay.  George Turklebaum, 51, who had been employed as a
  proof-reader at a New York firm for 30 years, had a heart attack
  in the open-plan office he shared with 23 other workers.  He
  quietly passed away on Monday, but nobody noticed until
  Saturday morning when an office cleaner  asked why he was
  still working during the weekend.  His boss Elliot Wachiaski
  said "George was always the first guy in each morning and the
  last to leave at night, so no one found it unusual that he was in
  the same position all that time and didn't say anything.  He was
  always absorbed in his work and kept much to himself.  "A post
  mortem examination revealed that he had been dead for five
  days after suffering a coronary.  Ironically, George was
  proofreading manuscripts of medical textbooks when he died.

  You may want to give your co-workers a nudge or kick
  occasionally.

I heard that they were looking to fill all the slots over there with
Analysts, hope they know what they are doing, at least until I get all my
stock sold!  Which is not looking good again?!?!? What's with that close
yesterday?

so HPL was sold...that means Kenny has to go too?  He should look for
another spot at ENE, Dwayne is BAD NEWS FOR HIM.  Do you think he's
prejudice against Greg too?

Are you gonna look for something else?

We'Ve had great sunshine weather this week!  But cold still.  All the bulbs
are coming up, we should have flowers soon.  I want the builder to get his
crap off my land so I can start planting!  We need grass and FLOWERS!!!

Well it#s time for lunch, we're having Greek today, stuffed bell peppers
with feta in a tomatoe sauce with rice and salad!  I'm starving!!!  Since
Claudia started working for us I'm getting FAT!  It's so nice not to do ALL
the cooking and none of the cleaning!  When you visit you will get to sample
of cooking...I think you will like it.

Gotta go, write!!!

That was one of the funniest things I have ever seen on the internet.
Reminds me of that Chilton video. I am just a sucker for good fart humor. My
trip to Egypt has come through! I am leaving Friday and returning Feb 11. I
would like to come down to Houston for one of the parades art car or pride
or both. Whatever. Good weekends for me (Fridays off) are March 2, 16, 30.
Find out if you can get a hall pass or when the parades are and we will
discuss when I return. I sent in my 12th man pledge today. The deadline is
the 30th.

Just talked with Stinson and he is going to give Rayfael a call to set up an 
"informal" talk.

He says what they do is bring in people with Rayfael's level of technical 
expertise, but no financial skills as a Sr. Specialist so they can learn the 
business.  They really don't use the Associate/Analyst route for hiring 
people.

Tell Rayfael to expect the call, or he may in fact want to give Stinson a 
call directly (34748).

:-)

Oh, Scott, that is so great about your mom!!! But that is also soooo
interesting about thalidomide....I think of that drug alot here, because you
see the effects of the children here alot, well they aren't children
anymore...they are my age, but they are everywhere here.  so that drug works
on cancer?!?!?!? incredible!  does it have any side effects? (other than on
babies)

MMMM....liquid manure!  I hardly ever get that in the city!!!

I'm glad you'll be doing your business in private now!!!

By  the way, my mom finally got to see the doctor at MD Anderson yesterday.
They are going to put her in clinical trial where she'll be treated with
thalidomide (the drug that caused the deformed babies in the late sixties).
She starts that next week.  She had to promise not to have a baby!  That
should be pretty easy to live up to since she has no uterus and my dad's
been fixed!!!  Anyway, we're hoping that it slows things down, or puts it
in remission altogether.

Scott

We went to dinner with some friends, Udo and Annette, to a new restaurant
here....
The Outback!  It was the same building inside and out as in Houston...even
the same kind of parking lot!  We got there at 6, we had movie tickets for
8, and it was exactly the same as in Houston, an hour wait at the bar!  The
menu was the same and some were in English, some were in Deutsch, we had a
bloomin onion and steaks (they were from Argentina though)  Armin even got
his frozen margarita!  We had a great time, the place was full of Americans.
It was so different from german restaurants.

We saw a german film afterwards, The Experiment, it was very intense, but
good.  (Scott you would like this one). The theatre was really nice, just
like an American Cineplex.  But the film was in German.  It made us feel
like we were back "home".

Hope you all had a good St. Patty's!
C onnie

On Saturday, please go over to my house and feed my cats (and check out the 
newly resurfaced pool!!!)

To get in 14921
When you leave #2

I have a new keypad for the alarm system, so you should have no difficulties 
but in case you need to give the secret password it is Cornhuskers...

Please open one can of food and leave it on the floor, and refresh the water 
dish...

Thanks,

Julie  :-)

Oh, Scott, I trully am sorry!  No, I'm at the office and I had only the one
message at home that the dogs had to go out when I looked.  I am so very
sorry!  Do you really think it's over?

Hang in there, as hard as it may seem, things will work out for you.

Love,

Well....I don't expect that any of you will attend...BUT I want you to know 
that
you are INVITED and we wish with all our hearts that you could be here.

As far as how long before we are in the house...well that depends on the 
market,
you have to remember that I am paying for all of the personal part of our
building with MY money.  The house will be 100% paid for, that's the German 
way.
 Yeah, that makes me sick but that's how it is...so I think we are looking at 
an
end of March move in...time and money will tell.  All of the big costs will be
covered by the end of the year, the only thing left is the finishing stuff,
marble, tile, wood floors, stairs, paint, wallpaper...hopefully only a few
hundred thousand more of cash, hopefully!

I Just left the building and I LOVE IT!  They put the windows in the office,
workers break room, warehouse, and our personal garage...I love them, and 
that's
a great relief, I had NO idea how they were going to look, the german way is
custom for each window and NO examples...I told Armin what I wanted and he did
good!

I could just stay there for hours looking at it all!  Can't wait until you can
come visit!

Just read a story in DMN about the high gas prices. Some guy named Palmer
from Enron quoted "we love volatility" Chemical businesses shutting down and
selling their gas and power back and making more than if they stay open. I
hope you have been making money.

It is cold here, below 20 last night. My trip to CA is delayed until Sunday
night right in the middle of the Cowboys game.

I guess you heard about Colby Freeman transferring to ACU. I so wanted to
see him run the ball. But, now we are committed to the forward pass.

We'd love for ya'll to come visit!  My family vacation is in July, so we are
planning on comig to Houston around the 4th of July and leaving July 18, so
either the first part of our trip or the last we have to hook up.  Armin's
dying for Cafe Adobe!!! And a relaxing vacation.  The rest of the year we
are here, until Christmas...I want to spend that back in the states
(hopefully).

I have to tell you what Angus is doing..he cracks me up!  He loves to
sunbathe, back when we were at the apartment and the sun would come out, he
would ask to go outside and sit in a chair on the front porch (of course he
would wait until I put a cushion in it).  Well here at the office the sun
comes in the south window most all day, he loves it.  But he has a problem
in the morning when it is only shining on the west wall.  so each day he
goes over to the wall and starts tapping on it with his foot!  Like he can
bring the sunshine down on the floor to him!!! Then he stares at me to fix
it!!!  He's so entertaining!

So who were you partying with on Tues?  What's Greg McClendon up to these
days?  Does he ever do anything with you or Julie anymore?  I never hear
about him.

Well, back to work for a while!
Later..connie

The Party date has been set...Next Wednesday at Noon we will have the German
Traditional Roof Party and you are all invited!

This party takes place when the framework for the roof is completed.  The roof
meister gives some kind of speech and we take a cut tree for him to put on top
of the roof...i think.  The only roof party that I have ever attended, the
roofer fell off the roof just as the party was to start, this roof was 3 
stories
high!  So the party never got off the ground, the emergency medical helicoptor
did eventually get the very broken but not dead roofer out of the cellar 
ground
and I never got to see what really should happen (we were just glad the roofer
wasn't dead).

HOPEFULLY, our party will be much less eventful...our house is only 2 stories
high and there is no cellar!

But at noon on Wednesday we will have beer, bratw_rst, bread, sekt and other
beverages for all to enjoy!  Hope to see as many of you as possible there, for
those unable to attend... we will send photos!

Connie, Armin and Angus

DTI will not be charging for TTT service through June 01, they will probably 
not start to charge any time soon, however they still have the ability to 
charge.  My feeling is that they will find it difficult to charge after 
providing the service for free for some time.  If they do start to charge by 
nom is there a way we can provide that service?  I will think about that one.

Well, I think there is a light at the end of the tunnel...but not soon enough
for Armin.  I am afraid he is not going to make it to the end of the week, his
parents have him soooo stressed out.  I won't even go into what all they are
doing to him, you wouldn't beleive it!

Claudia, our housekeeper, is WONDERFUL! She has us all cleaned out and
organized, IT'S GREAT!  I don't have to do a thing, no vacuum, no laundry, no
cleaning, no ironing, nothing!!! AND  she's a great cook!  Right now she's
cooking my favorite...schweinebraten with klo?e and sauce!  She makes enough 
for
lunch that we can have it in the evening if I don't want to cook.  I am 
getting
spoiled rotten and I love it!  She's also very good company, alot of fun.  I
can't wait until we are all at the new building, all moved into the house too.

The carpet man is at the building now putting down the glue stuff that the
carpet sits on for the office, the carpet comes tomorrow!  Then we can start
putting furniture in!  I have already packed up all the files that I could and
those boxes are in the archive room at the new office.  The phone gets turned
on, on Friday!  I will have a direct number to my desk, I think it's going to 
be
991199119, I have 50 to choose from and I think I like that one.  Then for the
private house 991199111.  Armin and Lolo have to program the system this week,
they don't always have alot of luck when they tackle this task...cross your
fingers for them!  Armin needs something to go smoothly for a change.

Today we received our first payment from a customer!  It's so exciting to
finally make some money from all the work Armin does!  I hope it keeps coming 
in
and the stock market keeps going up and the Euro down!  Then we can finish the
house!!!  I still still don't know the date for when that will be, I hope in
another month to know more.  Armin wants to do so much of the work himself 
but I
don't know when he has the time. J_rgen, Lolo, Mitch and John all have been
helping him.

Our highs here are not hitting 30o F.  But at least it's dry, the snow is gone
and there isn't ice on the streets. Have ya'll warmed up there now?   Our
coldest temp this year was like 16oF and I didn#t like that but at least it's
dry.

Well, Claudia said lunch is ready, so gotta go for now!  I will try to do 
better
on my emails I haven#t been sending many lately to anyone!  Hope you are
well!  (Got any gossip???)

Love,
Connie, Armin and Angus

No, I can't say that Argentine beef is better than American, but it IS
better than German (they just can't grow OR cut a cow right over here)!

Yeah, I used ChemLawn on my house in Copperfield, and they said once it's
dry it's fine for the dogs, and I did have a really nice yard...but I think
that was after I stopped them and started using Rob Townsend...anyway my
garten now SUCKS!  It'S FULL  OF CRAPP, lumber, building stuff and a huge
crane that just won't go away!!!

You really would like the movie we saw, maybe it will come there with
untertitel in English, but you would understand it in Deutsch...it's about
an Experiment that was done, I think at the Univ of Cal.  They took 20
people, made 10 prisoners and 10 their guards..in reality they had to stop
the experiment after 7 days because things were getting out of control...in
the movie they carried it on further..it was great!  Very intense, very
blooooody in the end!

I can't BELIEVE that you stayed home for St Patty's!  I watched a
documentary on Ireland and St Patty's and now I understand why it's a bigger
celebration outside of Ireland than in Ireland.  I have a great new channel
on my satellite, the English Travel channel...IT'S GREAT!  They have all
kinds of shows on countries all over the world, AND IT'S IN ENGLISH!!!

That's terrible that someone tried to pull up your plant, do you remember
that they stole a clay pot of dirt from me over there, incredible!  No, here
we don't have that trouble...YET!  Maybe in 15 - 20 years it will come.  I
hope not.  I have such nice plants in pots outside the office and really
pretty garten art in it, it would be gone in a second in Montrose!

So what#S Happenning in NEw York for you and Julie???

I still haven't been able to do my taxes because of WELLSFARGO!!! They have
my mortgage now and I CANNOT get my 1098 from them, I have written them,
faxed them, emailed them and finally today telephoned them...I WAS ON HOLD
FOR A REP FOR OVER 15 MINUTES!!! I chewed her ass out when she finally got
on the phone and the bitch said she wasn't allowed to FAX IT TO ME!  I told
her she would not only fax me my interest for 2000 BUT ALSO THE PAYOFF,
because I would not have a mortgage at such a piece of ")o($/ company as
theirs....I did'nt mention that I had sold the house.

Everything is on track for the sale, we close on May 4th and I GET MY
MONEY...HONEY!!!!

Well it's late and I want to go home...take care..connie

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy 
bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 
people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote 
Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers 
control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow 
thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, 
including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket 
PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy 
Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot 
program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up 
to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and 
the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution 
pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For 
more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the 
Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be 
a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even 
have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more 
information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to 
connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee 
with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and 
such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes 
no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any 
goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.  Home.Enron.com

I was out sick yesterday, and was in the bathroom when you called (taking 
care of one end or the other!), then I passed out soon thereafter.  I feel 
much better to day, and am at work.  I'll take a raincheck on the food until 
tomorrow or Thursday (whichever works for you).

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)
