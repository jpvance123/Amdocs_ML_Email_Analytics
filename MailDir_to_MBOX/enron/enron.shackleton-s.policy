There have been growing concerns regarding the copying and distribution of 
licensed and copyrighted materials among various groups within Enron.  For 
example, if you are a subscriber to Petroleum Argus, Intelligence Press, 
Energy Intelligence, Opis, or any other information source, it is unlawful to 
copy and distribute that information among others if only one 
license/subscription is ordered.

Such activity exposes Enron to legal ramifications and reflects poorly on our 
reputation as a professional and ethical company. 

If you have copyrighted material that you would like distributed, please 
contact either Bruce Ferrell at 853-4815, or Julie Pechersky at 853-9225 in 
Market Data, to address the issue.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

The Treasury Department recently expanded its list of Specially Designated 
Nationals and Blocked Persons under the Narcotics Trafficking Sanctions 
Regulations by adding a large number of Colombian entities and individuals.  
Property and interests in property of these Colombian entities and 
individuals that are in the United States or in the possession or control of 
U.S. persons are now blocked.

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)

To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's 
preferred suppliers, it is recommended that each traveler enroll in 
National's and Alamo's preferred traveler programs.  National's Emerald Club 
membership and Alamo's Quicksilver program are designed to speed the 
transaction time by providing services such as counter bypass and rapid 
return.  The enrollment fees for these programs have been waived for Enron 
travelers.  Enrollment packets will be mailed to the addresses of Enron 
American Express T&E Cardholders.  You may also find an enrollment form on 
the Enron Travel Program intranet @ gss.enron.com <http://gss.enron.com/>.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact Jeff Leath at 
713-646-6165.

Now that we are past the end of the year rollover, a question has been raised 
concerning whether or not Y2K representations and warranties should be given 
or requested in connection with acquisitions and divestitures.  It is our 
recommendation that no special Y2K representations be given or requested.  
Obviously, there may be situations in which some form of general 
representation or warranty may be appropriate with respect to the condition 
of computer hardware, software and related systems.  In such situations, we 
suggest that representations and warranties that are customarily used for the 
purchase or sale of computer hardware, software and related assets be 
utilized.  If you have any further questions on this matter, please contact 
Alan Aronowitz or Michael Robison.

Last week, Enron Corp. announced a 2-for-1 stock split of its common shares=
=20
for shareholders of record on July 23, 1999. This means that each sharehold=
er=20
will receive one additional share for every share owned.  The anticipation =
of=20
the impending stock split has resulted in a number of questions from=20
employees.  The answers to some of the most frequently asked questions=20
concerning the stock split and how it will affect your stock holdings are=
=20
listed below.

What is a stock split?

A stock split is an increase in the number of shares of Company stock witho=
ut=20
a change in shareholders=01, equity or in the aggregate market value at the=
 time=20
of the split.  For example, one share of stock with a value of $80 will be=
=20
converted to two shares of stock with a value of $40 per share.  The Compan=
y=01,
s total number of outstanding shares will double when the 2-for-1 split=20
becomes effective.

What is the effective date of the stock split?

The split will be effective August 13.  On August 16 (the first business da=
y=20
following the split), the opening market price of Enron Corp. common stock=
=20
will be roughly half of the August 13 closing price. =20

How will the stock split affect my stock holdings?

Stock Options

If you have stock options, you will continue to hold options with an=20
equivalent value after the split.  If you have 1,000 options at a grant pri=
ce=20
of $50.00, after the split you will hold 2,000 options at an adjusted grant=
=20
price of $25.00.  The vesting provisions and the option term will not chang=
e.

Savings Plan/ESOP/Phantom Stock/Restricted Stock

If you hold shares of Enron Corp. common stock or phantom stock through a=
=20
Company-sponsored plan (including holdings in the Employee Stock Ownership=
=20
Program (ESOP) and the Savings Plan), the shares in your accounts will=20
double.  For example, if you hold 100 shares in your ESOP account, you will=
=20
hold 200 following the effective date of the split.  And, if you hold share=
s=20
with a value of $2,500 in your Savings Plan account on August 13, the value=
=20
of your investment will remain essentially unchanged when the market opens =
on=20
August 16 (the first business day following the split).  The number of shar=
es=20
reported on your 3rd quarter Savings Plan statement will reflect the stock=
=20
split.
=20
Other Personal Holdings

If you own shares outright and hold the stock certificates, you will receiv=
e=20
new stock certificates.  Our transfer agent, First Chicago Trust Company,=
=20
will mail stock certificates to shareholders of record on or around August=
=20
13.  Your certificate will be mailed to the address on file with our transf=
er=20
agent, which is the address where you received your latest dividend check. =

From:  Cliff Baxter and Kevin Hannon


In July, as part of the Enron North America (ENA) reorganization, the=20
implementation of several objectives were highlighted as critical to the=20
continued growth of ENA including: 1) accelerate the development of our=20
people, 2) significantly expand our customer network and associated markets=
,=20
and 3) accelerate and enhance the information flow between groups, both=20
within ENA and across Enron. Consistent with these objectives and with the=
=20
corporate goal of fostering =01&One Enron=018, we would like to announce th=
e=20
following organizational changes in the Coverage/Origination Groups and the=
=20
Commercial Transactions Group within ENA.

1) Coverage/Origination:

To ensure a consistent strategy, the free flowing of resources and product=
=20
technology and the appropriate focus in the midstream and downstream=20
businesses, the following coverage/origination groups will be consolidated=
=20
under the leadership of Dave Delainey :
a) power development solutions for electric and gas utilities, municipals,=
=20
co-ops, energy service companies and IPP=01,s;
b) the Downstream Coverage/Origination groups which focus on delivering a=
=20
broad range of products and services to the heavy industrial customers=20
including  pulp and paper, chemicals, plastics, refined products, metals an=
d=20
mining, heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation,=
=20
textiles and glass manufacturing the Eastern and Western U.S. Midstream=20
Coverage/ Origination groups which focus on energy, finance and industries.

Downstream Coverage/Origination

As energy deregulation continues in North America, it is becoming clear tha=
t=20
the heavy industrial segment will be an important customer market for both=
=20
ENA and Enron Corp.  Further, it is clear that ENA can significantly expand=
=20
its industrial customer network and create more innovative industrial=20
solutions by having a group that can deploy all the capabilities of Enron=
=20
Corp.  Against this backdrop, the Downstream Coverage/Origination function=
=20
will expand its product offering to include not only ENA=01,s existing ener=
gy=20
commodities, energy services, finance, assets and pulp and paper capabiliti=
es=20
but also EES=01,s energy outsourcing capability and Global Fuel=01,s chemic=
als,=20
plastics and refined products risk management capability.  These additional=
=20
capabilities will be offered in conjunction with EES and the Global Fuels=
=20
groups. Given the size and importance of this Enron initiative, Greg Piper=
=20
will be returning from Portland to manage this business. Under Greg=01,s=20
leadership, the Downstream Origination effort will be segmented into three=
=20
sub-groups given the nature of these industries and our product offering:
a) Pulp and Paper =01) Edward Ondarza will continue to manage the coverage=
=20
activities in the Pulp and Paper business. This group will be responsible f=
or=20
the provision of innovative=20
products and services in the pulp and paper industry including the provisio=
n=20
of paper risk management products;
b) Chemicals, Plastics and Refined Products =01) We have asked Jim Ajello t=
o=20
lead the coverage activities in this business.  This group will be=20
responsible for the provision of innovative products and services in the=20
chemicals and refined products industries;
c) Non-Integrated Industrials =01) Bruce Garner, formerly leader of Bankers=
=20
Trust=01,s global metals and mining group in London, has joined ENA to lead=
 the=20
coverage activities in this business.  This group will be responsible for t=
he=20
provision of innovative products and services for the metals and mining,=20
heavy manufacturing, industrial gases, fertilizers, transportation, textile=
s=20
and glass manufacturing industries.




Midstream Coverage/Origination

a) Eastern Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01, activities will focus o=
n=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the Eastern=
=20
Interconnect. We have asked  Janet Dietrich to assume the leadership of thi=
s=20
group;
b) Western Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will focus =
on=20
energy, finance and power development solutions for electric and gas=20
utilities, municipals, co-ops and energy service companies in the WSCC. The=
y=20
will also continue to manage all Qualified Facilities (QF) restructuring=20
opportunities in the Western U.S.  We have asked Chris Calger to assume the=
=20
leadership of this coverage group. Chris will relocate to Portland from=20
Calgary where he currently leads the Canadian downstream origination effort=
s;
c) IPP Merchant Coverage/Origination =01) This group=01,s activities will f=
ocus on=20
the provision of structured energy, finance and asset solutions for the=20
emerging merchant power generators who control large portfolio=01,s of merc=
hant=20
power generation either through development or acquisition. We have asked =
=20
Mike Miller to assume the leadership of this group.  In addition, Mike will=
=20
continue to manage the power development activities in the Eastern=20
Interconnect;
d) Eastern QF Restructuring =01) This group will focus on the QF restructur=
ing=20
opportunities in the Eastern Interconnect including the existing=20
restructuring and re-capitalization of the East Coast Power assets.  We hav=
e=20
asked Dave Duran to assume the leadership of this business. Greg Blair,=20
formerly of Enron Asia=01,s development group, Doug Clifford, formerly of=
=20
Citizens power, and Dick Lydecker, formerly of Cogen Technology, will join=
=20
this newly formed business.

2) Commercial Transactions:=20

The Commercial Transactions Group (CTG), co-headed by Ray Bowen and Jeff=20
Donahue, was formed to provide a centralized resource for the execution of=
=20
transactions within ENA =01) and thereby, improve ENA=01,s efficiency in ex=
ecuting=20
transactions and free-up the origination groups to increase their intensity=
=20
of client coverage.  CTG consists of six primary functions: Transaction=20
Development, Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management, Commodity=20
Structuring and Transportation, Transactional Support/Accounting, Technical=
=20
Analysis and Upstream Asset Management.

The Transaction Development Group will be responsible for deal leadership,=
=20
execution and optimization of all aspects of a transaction in conjunction=
=20
with the originator. The function will be divided into four teams, each of=
=20
which will be dedicated to between two and four origination groups.  This=
=20
dedication to specific groups should provide a closer link, better service=
=20
and greater accountability with the origination groups; however, the CTG=20
resources are designed to be a fungible and flexible resource allocated to=
=20
the highest value transactions across the coverage functions:

a) Midstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Eastern and=
=20
Western Coverage/Origination Groups.  The senior members of this group=20
include Billy Lemmons, George McCormick, Erin Norris and Russ Porter. Billy=
=20
Lemmons joined Enron in 1992.  Most recently, he was the Vice-President of=
=20
Capital Structuring and Risk Management for EES. Russ Porter joins us today=
=20
from Dynegy where he was a manager with responsibilities for power=20
origination.
b) Downstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to ENA=01,s industr=
ial=20
origination efforts in Pulp and Paper, Petrochemicals and Refining,=20
Environmental Energy, Metals and Mining and other industries as coverage is=
=20
established.  The senior members of this team include Rodney Malcolm, Jay=
=20
Boudreaux, Finley Biggerstaff and Chris Helfrich.  We anticipate announcing=
=20
two to four more additions to this team within the next few weeks.
c) Generation Transaction Development will be dedicated to the IPP Merchant=
=20
Services and power plant development and QF Restructuring groups.  The seni=
or=20
members of this team include Thomas Suffield, Andy Kelemen, Kelly Mahmoud a=
nd=20
John House. Thomas Suffield joined Enron in 1996. Most recently, he was the=
=20
Vice-President of Origination for the Latin American group in Azurix.  We=
=20
anticipate announcing two more additions to this team within the next few=
=20
weeks.
d) Upstream Transaction Development will be dedicated to the Producer=20
Finance, Coal and Gas Assets groups.  The senior members of this team inclu=
de=20
Brad Dunn, John Curtin and Chris Hilgert.  We hope to announce the addition=
=20
of at least one VP to this group prior to yearend.

Ray Bowen will have primary oversight responsibilities for the Upstream and=
=20
Downstream Transaction Development teams with Jeff Donahue having primary=
=20
responsibilities for the Midstream and Generation teams.  Andrea Reed will=
=20
continue to head Capital Structuring and Portfolio Management: all junior=
=20
commercial resources within the Transaction Development teams will have dua=
l=20
responsibilities to both their Transaction Development teams and to the=20
Capital Structuring Group.  The remaining four groups within CTG will remai=
n=20
largely unchanged.  In addition, the Origination and the Transaction=20
Development teams and their respective origination groups will be located=
=20
together.

We believe that these changes will significantly enhance our market coverag=
e=20
and industry knowledge in all ENA=01,s markets particularly in the industri=
al=20
markets. It will also provide a closer partnership and accountability betwe=
en=20
the Coverage/Origination Groups and the CTG Groups.=20

Please help us in continuing to build on the success we have enjoyed in Nor=
th=20
America by working with us to implement these changes.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=

of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=

The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=

=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=

selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=

In light of the expanding Enron global messaging environment and the recent 
influx of inappropriate "mis-directed" mail messages addressed to 
company-wide distribution groups, a new centralized "mass mail" 
administration service is being introduced.

As of Friday, the 20th of August 1999, all company-wide distribution groups 
were made unavailable for addressing by the general Notes user population.

All requests intended for distribution to company-wide distribution groups 
must be submitted to the following email accounts :

Enron North American Notes Users send to :  Corp Notes Admin/Corp/Enron@Enron
Enron Europe Notes Users send to :   Enron Europe General Announcement@ECT

The above accounts are monitored on a regular basis and requests submitted 
are reviewed for mass-mailing "suitability." Company-wide email addressing is 
restricted to business use of the email system.  Upon verification and review 
of the requests, a message will be drafted for distribution and sent out 
after 6 p.m. on the requested distribution date.  In case of emergency 
distributions, please contact your local help desk.

All requests must indicate the following information :

Requester name(s) (if this information is omitted, the sender will be 
considered the "contact" for the request.)
Requester contact number(s)
Intended audience for the message
The text message (Please avoid large graphic files)
Required send date & time

All "mass-mailing" requests must be submitted before 1:00 p.m. on the day 
"distribution" is required. If special mailing lists are required, a period 
of 24 hours may be required to draft the list from Human Resources.

Regards,
Enron Global Messaging Administration

Car Rental Options for Enron Travelers

Rental car contracts for 2001 have been awarded to:

National Car Rental (Primary) and  Alamo Rent-A-Car (Secondary).  

The intent of these agreements is to consolidate and leverage Enron's total 
car rental spend to achieve the most favorable rates and non-pricing 
provisions (i.e. insurance).

National Car Rental, due to its service levels, availability and total value 
proposition, has been awarded Primary status and is recommended as the first 
choice for Enron travelers' needs.

Alamo Rent-A-Car, a sister company to National, has been awarded a contract 
reflecting a Secondary status, due to its service levels, availability and 
low cost solutions.  Alamo is recommended as an alternative to National, 
where available.

When you rent a vehicle in the United States, (including Puerto Rico) or 
Canada, the following insurance provisions are included, regardless of rate 
selected: 
1. L/DW (Loss/Damage Waiver) - This is what is called Comprehensive or 
Collision on your personal auto. It covers the rental vehicle and pays for 
any damage to it. 
2. Liability - This covers people and property outside the rental vehicle. 
For both National and Alamo, the coverage is $100,000 per person, $300,000 
per occurrence and $50,000 for property damage. 
** IMPORTANT ***
These coverages apply regardless of rate selected, as long as the following 
contract ID is communicated at the time of reservation and rental is recorded 
on the transaction rental agreement.  (National -  5000838 Alamo    - #143974)
To enjoy the highest levels of service while renting a vehicle from Enron's

To protect against viruses, all inbound Internet addressed e-mail with 
attachments will be quarantined beginning on December 31.  E-mail without 
attachments and those with low and medium risk attachments (see below) will 
be delivered after a brief delay of approximately 15 minutes.  Delivery of 
e-mail with high and extreme risk attachments will be released on January 6, 
2000 unless a serious virus threat still exists.

Category: File Extensions:
Low: *.txt, *.htm 
Medium: *.jpg, *.avi, *.bmp, *.pcx, *.gif, *.mid 
High: *.dot, *.doc, *.ppt, *.xls, *.hlp, *.(all unrecognizable)
Extreme: *.exe, *.bat, *., *.vbs, *.wbt, *.cmd, *.com, *.dll, *.zip

Low and Medium risk categories will not be held unless there is a deemed 
emergency in which case we will begin holding these file types as well
High risk will be held starting Thursday December 30, 1999 @ 6:00pm through 
January 5, 2000 @ 12:00 midnight
Extreme risk will be held starting Tuesday December 28, 1999 @ 12:00 midnight 
through January 5, 2000 @ 12:00 midnight

If you require an e-mail for business purposes that is being quarantined 
please send an e-mail to Y2K Email Release.  Please include business 
justification, name of sender and name of recipient(s).  We will review the 
email you are requesting and release it to you once we have determined it is 
virus free.

In addition to being cautious regarding email please remember to do the 
following as mentioned in Rick Causey's Y2K email on December 16, 1999:

 Log off. For most users, follow normal procedures and choose "Close all 
programs and log on as a different user" when leaving for the night.   
 Leave PC turned on.   

Following these procedures will allow the Infrastructure & Integration team 
to download virus patches to your PCs over the millennium weekend.  

A considerable amount of work preparing for Y2K has been done, and we hope 
you will help minimize any impact the calendar rollover could have on Enron's 
computer systems.

Attached is a copy of a letter which we are sending to our Corporate, Enron 
North America Corp., Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc., and Portland 
General Electric Company vendors as an additional step toward implementing 
our commitment to conduct our business affairs in accordance with the highest 
ethical standards.

We are sending you a copy of this letter so that you will be aware that your 
vendors will be receiving this letter and so that you will be reminded that 
Enron does enlist the cooperation of its vendors in adhering to its Business 
Ethics Policy.  

We appreciate your efforts in contributing to an Enron work environment of 
which we can all be proud.

OFFICE OF THE CHAIRMAN

CITY/STATE/ZIP


Dear Sir or Madam :


 Enron Corp. ("Enron") believes in conducting its business affairs in 
accordance with the highest ethical standards.  Accordingly, employees of 
Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a 
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which does 
not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct 
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business 
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given or 
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but your 
cooperation in respecting these standards is also critical.  Enron expects 
each of its vendors and contractors to maintain adequate records that 
document its work relationship with Enron.  Enron's auditing department will 
routinely conduct business ethics compliance audits of certain vendors and 
contractors with whom Enron does business.  Your recognition of our ethical 
standards allows Enron employees to work with you via arm's length 
transactions and avoids potentially embarrassing and unethical situations.  
If you ever become aware of variances from our policy, please advise:

James V. Derrick, Jr.
Executive Vice President and General   Counsel
(713) 853-5550	 or report
	anonymously
	to:	Enron Compliance Officer
		CONFIDENTIAL-Conduct of Business Affairs
		PO Box 1188
		Houston, Texas   77251-1188.

 Your business relationship is important to us, and we look forward to 
maintaining that relationship with you.

          Very truly yours,

As you may know, the current employee stock option program (also known as t=

I am proud to announce to you the members of the newly created Enron 
Diversity Task Force.  The goals of this Task Force are twofold:  to instill 
Enron's commitment to diversity throughout the organization and to ensure 
that at Enron it is not your background that matters, but the quality of your 
ideas that continue to create the dynamic environment that challenges us to 
view the world from different perspectives.

These key leaders from throughout the company will work closely with our Task 
Force Leader, Cindy Olson, and me to shape Enron's commitment to diversity.

There are many different variations of the "ILOVEYOU" computer virus still 
being reported.  The IT Infrastructure team is continually updating our virus 
software as new versions become available, but it is extremely important that 
you do not open any attachments that you do not regularly receive from 
business associates.  Even business associates you are very familiar with 
could be sending you the virus without knowing it, so unless you are 
expecting an email from them with an specified attachment please do not open 
it.  If you are unsure whether to open an attachment please do not open it.  
Call your HelpDesk to ask any questions and to get verification if required.

We may need you to log out and log back in during the day as new anti virus 
updates become available.  We appreciate your cooperation while we all work 
to keep Enron's computing environment secure.

Please note the following Enron Policies regarding viruses: 

Email

Malicious Code (Virus) Screening
In addition to the Enron requirement for email attachments (received and 
sent) to be screened for malicious code (viruses, Trojan Horses, etc.), users 
of Enron information resources are required to detach email attachments that 
are received on to their hard drive for local virus screening purposes. 

All executables (*.bat, *exe, *.com, *.vbs) files should never be launched 
from email without first consulting with IT. 

Virus Alerts
The Internet is constantly being flooded with information about computer 
viruses and Trojan Horses. However, within among real virus notices are 
computer virus hoaxes. While these hoaxes do not infect systems, they are 
still time consuming and costly to handle. It only wastes bandwidth and 
unnecessarily alarms other computer users.

Please, do not perpetuate unconfirmed warnings about viruses and Trojan 
Horses. If you receive an invalidated warning, don't pass it to all your 
friends, pass it to your IT computer security manager to validate first.

 Enron Benefit Plans
Summary Annual Report


The basic financial and insurance information along with file attached 
provides a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual 
report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as 
required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a 
participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits 
under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

Subject:  Details of the Accounts Payable Department Move

Effective Monday, March 27, 2000, the Enron Corp Accounts Payable department 
will be located on the 5th floor of the 600 Jefferson building in Houston.  
This move will officially combine the Accounts Payable department currently 
located on the 12th floor of the Enron Building and the Accounts Payable 
department known as Enron International Accounts Payable, currently located 
on the 12th floor of Three Allen Center.  In the new organization, Larry 
Dallman will be director of AP operations and Judy Knepshield will be the 
director of Strategic Direction and Best Practices.

This move will not affect the EE&CC Accounts Payable department on the 35th 
floor of Three Allen Center.

Because of this move, our services will be somewhat limited on Friday, March 
24 and on Monday, March 27 as we get situated in our new offices.  If you 
anticipate having special requests on those two days, please get them to us 
before Thursday, March 23.

Below are the particulars about the move, the new location, and how we will 
interact with our customers:

other priority requests must be hand delivered to the appropriate AP location.


REQUESTS FOR COPIES FROM THE AP IMAGING GROUP:

the company number, vendor number or name, document date, amount and any 
other pertinent information you might have to help us find the document.  We 
cannot find documents using account coding data.  Due to the number of 
requests we are presently receiving, we cannot promise delivery dates; but we 
will make every effort to find documents promptly.
