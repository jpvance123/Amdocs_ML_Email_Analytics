Dad and mom,

As for my Cyprus trip, I flew into Lafkosia, the Turkish controlled half of
a town that the Greeks call Nicosia (which is probably the name that shows
up on the map).  From there went to a town called Maras (Greek name Varosha)
on the east coast.  Actually stayed in the contiguous town named Gazimagusa
(Famagusta to the Greeks).  (Just the name confusion suggests some pretty
deep problems on Cyprus, doesn't it.)  Have been working on an piece about
Maras for the last few days. Think its a winner.  Maras has been a ghost
town since the Turkish "peace operation" (i.e. invasion) in 1974, its empty,
spooky beach lined by abandoned high rise hotels.  Could get only so far as
a militarized border fence.  Should be timely in light of UN sponsored
"proximity talks" between the two sides that continue in Geneva on January
31st.

After going to Girne (Kyrenia), I returned to Turkey by a hydrofoil, which
though not similar in design probably close to the size of the ferry we used
to cross from SF to Marin.  I suppose that it riding above the waves at
times made things more smooth, though it didn't seem that way.  (Not even
sure those things are to be used on rough seas.) Occasionally when we hit a
big roll the bottom of the boat would drop back down to the sea with a huge,
literally nauseating slap.  (The boat equivalent of a belly flop I suppose.)
  I think the skipper, to avoid the roughest of the seas, cut directly over
to the Turkish coast, which we then followed east to the port of Tasucu.  I
guess it was probably a wise strategy, but more than doubled the time (and
discomfort).  Still, especially now consigned to memory, a great experience.

It's snowing here too, pretty hard.  First big one for Istanbul, though the
rest of Turkey has been hit hard already.  (For example, I was wearing sun
glasses on my train ride back here, to cut down the snow glare.)  Most of
the snow now falling seems to be melting on the ground.  Besides being
beautiful (from the comfort of inside), my English lesson (I'm the teacher,
believe it or not) was cancelled, so I'm excited to get back to my writing.

Things go well.  Thanks for the note.

Love,

Mark-O

Howdy again,

You might be interested in knowing that a version of the previous was
published in the English language Turkish Daily News here on February 9th.
(I'm still waiting to hear back from some folks in the States.)  Afraid that
it might appear a bit negative about the Turks, I shortened it, taking out
for example my speculation about how Turkish soldiers might treat folks who
outflanked the fence as well as some of my thoughts about why all the
windows had been knocked out.  (I did leave in my thought about
"vindictiveness" being the justification.)   It still got edited a bit, for
example my use of the word "invasion" was changed to "Peace Operation",
which is the somewhat euphemistic term it is known by here (which doesn't
not mean I am saying the Turks weren't justified in invading the place).

I'd love to hear your thoughts about it, or any other news that you all
might have.

Hope all goes well.

Mark

Tom,

You don't know how nice it is receiving your e-mails, and to hear how
excited you are.  There's no Hemingway in the making here, but I see you
know that he got his start as a journalist.  Did you also know his first
serious work was covering the the two Balkan wars (1912-14) in the city of
Erdine (the Greek, and more famous, name is Adrianople), which is just west
of here on what is now the border of Turkey and Greece.  (I visited Erdine
several months ago; its another messy, beautiful Turkish town.)   Some
historians consider these wars to really be part of World War I.  And I
guess he witnessed part of the huge cross-migrations of Turks and Greeks,
when at the foundation of the Turkish Republic (1923) hundreds of thousands
of Greeks left Turkey and hundreds of thousands of Turks left Greece.  (Both
counties were previously part of the more tolerant Ottoman Empire, the
existence of which was destroyed by the rise of nationalism in the last two
centuries.)  This migration, a tragedy of epic proportions (know now simply
as the "Mubadele [The Exchange]" in Turkish) was probably one of the first
examples of large scale ethnic cleansing.

About having gone through a lot, not true.  Today is beautiful day here in
Istanbul, pleasantly cool (after an awfully hot and humid summer), the air
cleared by a nightime rain.  It was tough to imagine the pain and hardship
going on just several miles west and east of here, to which now is added mud
and cold.  This morning I taught my students (at the Istanbul branch office
of a German company that makes silicon and silicon products) the English
expression "Every dark cloud has a silver lining"  I feel I've lived my
life, when not under perfectly clear skies, in the silver linings.

More later.  I too am excited to see what happens between now and tomorrow's
deadline.  Will keep you secretly (i.e. bcc) posted.

Hope you got a good night's sleep.

Mark

Howdy,

Going to be in Munich one night on way to SF.  Unplanned, it turns out will
be there during Octoberfest (which starts in September).  Does anyone know
of a reasonably priced place to stay there, with e-mail address?  Don't want
to sleeping it off on the cobblestones.  Thanks.

Mark-O

Howdy,

Its me again.  Sorry about filling up your boxs with this "personal" junk
mail.

My tenant, who was excellent, is moving out at end of September, so will be
spending some of my time in SF looking for someone new.  Any leads?  Most of
you know its details; its expensive but competatively priced.

Mark-O

January 15, 2000

 Accompanied by the pleasing rat-a-tat-rat of the train wheels slapping the
joints between the rails, we are pulled slowly towards Istanbul.  Adana's (a
city of 1.6 million some 560 miles southeast of Istanbul) cement clutter and
jumbled sprawl are behind us.  It is night now and I imagine this exhausted
land moaning with relief as it is allowed a brief respite until dawn.  Fires
spot the darkened fields -- fields that have been fields longer than any on
this earth.  The silhouettes of men, going about some mysterious chores,
blink out the orange flames from time to time.  I can make out a ragged
black skyline of mountains to the north, scattered before them clumps of
lights marking towns.

Poised above it all, as if balanced by its handle on the palm of some
invisible giant, is the Big Dipper.  The handle points, roughly, in the
direction of Istanbul.  And from the dipper, onto that monstrous city, some
heavenly pap must certainly pour.  Having these last few days traveled
through a tired land full of people beleaguered by poverty, I have new
respect for that ancient town.  Thinking of it now, Istanbul seems imbued
with an almost childlike spunk, and an impressive set of toys with which to
amuse.

 Earlier in the day in Antakya (ancient Antioch, another 120 miles further
southeast of Istanbul), I had just boarded the bus for Adana when a little
girl started saying out loud, to her mother, the names of cities and towns,
some of which she must have seen on road signs.  "Iskenderun", "Adana", she
pronounced slowly and carefully.  "Kirikhan", "Dortyol," she continued.
Then she said "Istanbul", with the same care. But it had obviously pleased
her more than the rest, because she repeated it many times, each time with a
bit more zeal, until it finally sounded like a marvelous one-word song.
"Is-stawn-bul, Is-stawn-bul", she sang out sweetly, her lyric sometimes
punctuated with a short burst of the giggles.  "Is-stawn-bul!",
"Is-stawn-bul!"   I doubt I will ever hear or read or say the name again
without hearing her little song.  Even now, I am humming its happy tune.

And you may ask, "Where was the mother?"  Smiling, I suppose.  And dreaming
of Istanbul.

Howdy everybody,

I've cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish
Daily News (the English language paper here) later this week.  It's a first
person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, a
lot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeating
myself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to get
it out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fell
during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.

Happy holidays,

Mark-O

*  *  *

     Christmas Day, Istanbul


     The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,
which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronounced
words rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.
They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earth
to die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,
the story sounds strange and almost subversive.
     And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian
and Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by
God, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed's
prophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken
elevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.
     The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,
in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing a
big, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announces
that we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and in
English, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyrics
are basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?to
come?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly
translated chorus, which asks for the Son of God "to come will be born in
our heart?.
     I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to the
service.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I am
sure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in the
sanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first service
of the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italian
and a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, will
overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consist
mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently some
members of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, since
many of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even being
forced to stand out in the cold.


     Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month of
Ramadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,
or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one can
discern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during the
ninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solar
calendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started well
before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who was
roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.
  Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummers
have been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A tradition
originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is to
rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before
the sun comes up.
     Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year
for Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which some
say influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Total
remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I have
been told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all the
Turks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with what
I have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me
they fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all
sorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are
significantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, many
of the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful and
eat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing
a simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning and
eating them on my way to work.


     Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the
States.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough
Catholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really much
too strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little more
than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian
Church (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with my
twin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often struggle
for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed
susceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to see
if any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.
     The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being
shown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeat
that light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinite
darkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given that
I am so far from what I am most familiar.
     A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.
The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I lean
over toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids under
his breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,
straighten back up, listen to the song begin.
     There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes a
while for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomes
particularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As if
something ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space that
envelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  I
am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a
tear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the people
here are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to be
reminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is
itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the first
time since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.
     The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to take
communion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that we
walk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there I
am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,
who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonder
where they might have been hiding.
Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,
swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  An
older woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.
The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.
With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder how
she can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at least
pretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.
     The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the
church, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not want
to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return to
my seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, so
incongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view all
this, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in
such an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions have
come up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?


     This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live here
will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhaps
exchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shots
heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,
pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, the
Iftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, where
special Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- at
least to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and
the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls to
prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.
     Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleep
under the same black sky.

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not." *

 * Translation from the Bible.

"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!
The compassionate, the merciful!
King on the day of reckoning!
Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.
Guide Thou us on the straight path,
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are not
angry, and who go not astray." **

 ** Translation from the Koran.

Howdy.  The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, but
quickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some of
the original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflect
anything about yours truly.  Later.

At The Galata Tower Cafe

Cigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs in
the air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughts
about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.
"Take it easy", it says with a smirk.  "Relax."  A phony look of concern
clouds it further.  "What about taking a deep breath?"  Surreptitiously
(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has drifted
in closer, notices.  "There!  Isn't that better?"

"No", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to take
this internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through one
particularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  "Now get lost!"

Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way home
from school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which is
amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls
surrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the huge
tower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare out
the window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards of
the tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  The
tower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entire
neighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of the
durability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressive
characteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, by
the slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), it
stands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.

Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,
one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)
drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half as
bothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubt
been subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so year
history.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to
re-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm the
only one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have to
serve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't bother
them, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's play
has a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basic
training.

I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next to
me. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, for
my benefit, his version of the question "More tea?"  (He has given up on
words, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)

"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With a
little milk, please.]"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, I
agree  [and have been told before] too many "lutfens".  There are
probably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.
I'll work on perfecting them, "sonra [later]".)

 Yusuf nods, walks away.

I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I must
have made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of the
tables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is the
beginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitched
wail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poor
thing, I look away.

For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take a
close look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. "Dikkat! [Watch
out!]")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which is
surprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,
their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however
-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.

Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which are
seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle of
each table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.

Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner
of the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scene
from somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, it
has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared
amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  The
green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is
approaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color of
the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea
served here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto the
sand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as if
someone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed and
distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedly
stirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having
walked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long ago
surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearing
clothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn just
one more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreaming
perhaps of little more than an early spring.

I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,
surprisingly, begin to relax.

Have been in Antakya for the last couple days.  Will leave tomorrow.  Might
spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my "new" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

Howdy.  I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus.
Hope you enjoy it.

*  *  *

Maras, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- Attached to the rusting
chain-link fence I am approaching are several blood red signs, on which are
stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier
holding a rifle and a warning, in Turkish, that "Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir
[To Take Photographs Is Forbidden]".  The fence, no longer quite plumb in
the soft sand, seems to stumble across the beach, eventually ending at a
gently lapping Mediterranean. There a tangle of wires attached to the fence
extends a short way into the surf, making anyone's effort to outflank it
obviously intentional.  The Turkish soldiers patrolling the non-man's land
beyond, to the south, could thus treat such an intruder, I suppose, in
whatever way they might see fit.

In the other direction, the fence, before it has completely left the beach,
cuts sharply north, running in front of the hulks of four empty resort
hotels.  Above them in the deep blue of the pre-dusk sky hangs a crescent
moon, the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  One of the hotels still has the
remnants of an identifying sign, with just two of its six letter Greek name
remaining.  Another hotel, the smallest and no doubt at one time the
quaintest, has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors
leading out to tiny porches.  Some of the shutters have rusted off their
hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings, and now point out to
sea as if giving urgent warning.  Others hang limply, defeated, from a
single remaining hinge.
Most surprisingly, every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is
either missing or broken.  I am taken back by such thoroughness, given that
the most likely motivation was vindictiveness.  I struggle to find a loftie=
r
one, wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration, such
as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to
squatters.  Maybe -- though I find this thought the most troubling -- it ha=
d
been done just for the fun of it.





The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and
uninhabited Maras, the Turkish Cypriot's name for the town Greek Cypriots
call Varosha.  The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish
army invaded Cyprus in 1974.  Before that invasion the small Turkish Cyprio=
t
minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority, though in
the years since 1960, when Cyprus was given its independence by the English=
,
periodic outbreaks of inter-communal violence had led to increased
segregation and emigration.  The invasion, launched after a coup on the
island and another particularly vicious spat of violence, eventually put an
end to even this limited association -- as it did the worst of the violence=
.
  The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most 40% of the
island, which was accompanied and followed by one of the last century's all
too familiar mass cross-migrations.  The northern "half" is now home to
nearly all of the island's Turkish Cypriots, close to 20% of the total
population.

The border between the north and south, known as the Atilla Line, is one of
the many UN patrolled "blue lines" in the world.  Maras actually falls
within Northern Cyprus, with the Attila Line further to the south.  It is
controlled now by the Turkish army.  At the time of the invasion the town
had been a thriving, up and coming resort town, run mostly by Greek
Cypriots.  Indeed, all over Cyprus, since its independence -- despite the
periodic, deadly violence -- tourism had been booming.  But here in Maras,
at least, the boom is no more.  The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who
once owned, ran or otherwise worked there, fled in panic before the
advancing Turkish army, reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishe=
s
on tables and washing on lines, some forgetting to turn off lights that
burned on and on for years.

UN sponsored "proximity talks" between the North and the South  -- called
proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face -=
-
started in New York on December 4th.  They are set to continue in Geneva
this January 31st.  The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot
owners, or more precisely their return to it, is no doubt high on this
meeting's (thus far secret) agenda, as it has been over the years at the
many similar, though always fruitless, negotiations.  This time around,
however, expectations are running higher than usual, primarily because of a
positive change in the dynamic between the two side's by far most important
sponsor states, Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, for example, has recently
acquired candidacy status within the European Union, which commits it to
resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece.  Greece, o=
n
the other hand, has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the
international stage, the biggest of which was being caught last February
having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader -- and
terrorist in most people's minds -- Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan.  Coupled with th=
e
significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance
Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters las=
t
year, the two countries just may be willing to push their client states
toward a deal.





The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve o=
f
the short beach I am walking.  Behind me, at this beach's other end, is
inhabited Maras' nicest hotel (oddly sporting an English name, the Palm
Beach Hotel).  If you looked in that direction, taking in only the fine
hotel, the attractive beach, the dark blue sea, you might think you were in
a tourist paradise.  But this is no paradise.  As I walk the last few feet
to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge, much longer than the one =
I
am on, sweeping south most of the way to the horizon.  There are more
hotels, which I knew from what I had read were also empty.  But my reading
has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all.  First, in the
distance, one, two, three empty hotels quickly come into view, then, more
slowly, dozens more.  At the fence, with the entire beach now visible, I
count more than thirty of them, and these just on the waterfront.

Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment
scattered about the sand.  I try to imagine the happy cries of the children
as their parents, more than twenty- five years before, pushed them round an=
d
round in dizzying circles on the miniature merry-go-around, now rusted and
partially buried by drifted sand.  There is a long slide too, though
half-tumbled down, one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed
after so many years of weather and neglect.  My own memories of childhood
end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized no-man's land.  How
different life must seem to those whose memories do.  What sorts of dreams
are built on this type of innocence lost?

I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel, along the way wondering if
it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence.  On
its porch I chose a chair, since it has become cold, near a partly cracked
door through which comes a warm draft.  I order a cup of tea.  As the
evening grows darker, so does the abandoned town spread out before me.  The
crescent moon is now higher in the sky and, together with a strategically
placed star, provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire disma=
l
scene below.

At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door.  The bigger
of the two is gripping the arm of the other, directing him forward to the
porch's railing.

"Bak [look]!" he says in Turkish, gesturing out toward the sea with a broad
sweep of his free arm.  "Harika, degil mi [Wonderful, isn't it]?"

"Evet, cok guzel [Yes, very beautiful]", his friend agrees.

They stand gazing out over the sea, though after a brief moment I see the
smaller man's head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore.  The
bigger man glances at his friend, sees where he is looking, then looks
himself.  They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man
returns his attention to his friend, squeezes his arm.  His friend, as if
awakening from a trance, slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins, smiles up at
his companion.  After two identical, simultaneous shrugs, they chuckle
uneasily, shaking their heads as they do.

When they turn to return to the door, I holler out to them. "Baris mumkun m=
u
[Is peace possible]?"

They stop, look at me with frowns of curiosity.  "Nerelisiniz [Where are yo=
u
from]?"  It is the big one who had taken the lead.

"Amerikali"yim [I'm an American]."

His frown deepens, though now for a different reason.  "Belki dort, bes yil
sonra [Maybe four, five years from now], belki hic bir zaman yok [maybe
never]."

"Ama, ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak, bir yeni baris gurusmesi [But, what about
January 31st, the new peace negotiations] =01(?"

"Hah!" he exclaims, interrupting me. "Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var
[There are always new peace negotiations]!"

He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he
used to introduce, to his friend, the sea.

Tom,

Thanks again fro your thoughtful notes.

Can't say life normal, but in areas without damage not to far away from it.
Plenty of food.  No hoarding.  Delivery trucks seem to be bringing in normal
loads on a daily basis, just like before.  Of course, things will be taxed
by the demands of the rescue and restoration, but looks like the suffering
will be for those who were injured or who lost loved ones.  And what a lot
of suffering that will be.  Do have access to my building.  It is on solid
ground and is older, which in Turkey ironically means safer.  Still, spent
two of the last three nights sleeping outside, with millions of others.
Again, my buddy Ismail keeps coming through for me (Sukran too) and have
been able to enjoy his and his friends' company.  On these nights, every
open space not too close to a building seems to be filled with people
sleeping on blankets, jackets, etc.  Some have strung string between things
trees and other things you can tie string too and with sheets made
relatively cozy little spots for themselves.  It continues to amaze me how
kind and caring Turks are and how safe it is here (though I did hear of one
poor old fellow got his shoes stolen; perhaps he simply absent mindely
misplaced them).  Everyone, though, is tramatized, tired and sad.  And what
you read about impact on attempts to get economy, which has been hit hard by
Russian crisis, going unfortuantely appear right on the mark.  Wish Turkey
all the luck in the world.  It will need it.

Able to watch the local news, though obviously don't understand a lot of
what they're saying.  Still, the pictures tell enough.

More later.  Nice to know you're thinking about me.  Let dad and mom know
not taking any chances that weren't there already.

Love,

Mark

Subject: Re: earthquake---are you all right?



Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Things going along at a dizzying clip here; I will be proposing to Sukran o=

well (and there are lots of little hurdles to be leapt) looking at an early=

At the same time think I have found a fantastic place here on the Asian sid=

Tom,

Reading thourgh my mail and came to your newest note.  Thanks again for the
communication.

Like I said in earlier note, things seem pretty normal.  Stores without
electricty, but open.  No one seems to be hoarding.  Indeed, except for lack
of electricity I really wouldn't know anything happened, and I walked around
for a couple hours, covering some ground.

It was strange, but I had great trouble getting to sleep last night and
probably only did so minutes before the quake.  Next couple hours was spont
outdoors with the rest of my neighbors.  Took a pretty good walk then, too,
and again saw little damage (though admittedly it was the middle of the
night).  The one good thing is that for the first time in my stay here the
stars were all out, as the city had gone dark.  Quite an experience.

More later,

Mark

I'm in one piece; oblivious (if not for the news) of the bombs going off
all around me.  There's close to 15 million people here, so it should
take a while for them to get to me if they go at 13 people increments.

Inappropriate joking aside, what an awful thing.  I wonder at the
strange sort of logic that compels the bastards.  I hope they met as
grisly an end as the ones their handing out.

Did you get my picture?  Looking forward to the basket of goodies.  I
have a mailbox now, so letters should be more secure.

Thanks for the note.  Hope all is well.

Mark-O

Good news,

My article will be in the Perspectives section of this Sunday's Chicago
Tribune.  The Trib's web site is www.chicagotribune.com.  They left what I
sent them largely intact.  I was especially surprised by that, since they
had said that the article would be 800 words, I gave them more than 1400,
and I believe what's getting published will be just below 1300.

I'm very excited, and deeply grateful to Tom.

Love you all,

Mark

Dear Tom,

Thanks for the details.  Do they get letters about articles and, if so, do
you think I will get to see them (not just the ones they publish, assuming
they publish any)?  Can't wait to see what mom sends.  Tell her thanks ahead
of time.  I was able to pull a copy off the Internet, and it was enjoyable
to see my name in print, esepcially in such an important newspaper.  Thanks
again.

Interesting that in same section another article about Itstanbul was run,
and that in my article I mentioned the Hagia Sophia, the subject of that
other article.

Have felt an aftershock or two in the last week, but not the relatively big
one that killed a man.  And what I've felt nothing more than a little wiggle
of the earth.  (If you recall, on the morning of the big one I went back to
sleep, during which I felt lots of them (though again all not much more than
as if a truck went by the building).

Hope all goes well and you are not working too too hard (I know you're
workng too hard).  Hope we get a good bit of time together when I'm in
Chicago.  Maybe we can at least meet for grub on Sunday somewhere in near
your place.

Tom,

>From previous notes, which I bcc'd to you, looks like I'm "in business".

I've really appreciated your two recent e-mails (as I have all of them).
Had gone to the Tribune web site (something I'd done before, in order to
show my friends here your picture, and brag a bit) looking for info on
percepctive section, but probably due to my bad searches didn't unearth it.
You explanation was very important.  Also important were your comments on
what struck you about what I've been writing.  Those kind of comments are
the best kind.  Often, when writing, its hard to know what works and what
doesn't work.

Perhaps the most important thing, however, is that the article will be
published by "Tom Skilling's" brother.  Though nothing's been published yet,
and I shouldn't write as if that's a certainty (afraid of bad luck), would
never had gotten close to this opportunity without you.  I'm very grateful.

Love you and looking forward to both of us experiencing how this ol'
newspaper media machine works (something with which I guess you are all to
familiar).

Mark-O

Tuesday, August 17, 1999

The afternoon ezan is as if a lament.  The muezzin's voice seems fuller,
more emotional, and he sings strong and slow.  (Because the electricity in
my neighborhood had been off most of the day, apparently as a precaution
against fire, it was the first amplified call to prayer I have heard today.)
  But it is not for us he wails.  My neighborhood has been relatively
untouched; some fallen masonry, an empty top floor apartment overlooking the
square surrounding the Galata Tower half collapsed, debris from it partially
blocking the road that circles the square.

Thousands are suspected dead in an incredible series of earthquakes, the
first a possible and unfathomable 7.8 on the Richter scale, that began this
morning at 3:02.  Images on the TV are horrific: a five story building off
its foundation leaning against the building next to it; a warehouse, its
roof collapsed, on fire; the top half of a minaret toppled; a bridge severed
neatly into four parts, collapsed.  Worse yet, dozens of apartment buildings
flattened into cruel piles of concrete beams and slabs, twisted steel
reinforcement and rubble.  A handsome father breaks down in the arms of
friends in front of one such monstrosity.  At another, a reporter shoves her
microphone into a hole under a concrete beam, interviews someone trapped
there, the camera then panning back to show an impossible heap of debris
above.

I had trouble getting to sleep last night, which was unusual.  Ismail and I
had spent a fine evening at one of our favorite outdoor caf?s, under trees
whose leaves were gently tussled by a breeze coming down the Bosphorus.
(Nearby was the impressive bulk of the Nusretiye Mosque, built by Sultan
Mahmut the Second some 150 years ago to celebrate his victory over the
corrupt Janissary  [a kind of special guard to the Sultan].)  We spoke of
writing, of nationalism, about my upcoming trip to the States, about
learning a new language, about a possible trip together in the winter along
the coast of the Aegean Sea.  We were both particularly buoyant, with the
worst of the summer heat and humidity seemingly behind us.  In retrospect,
it was as if we were summing some things up, a minor period in our lives
over, a new one soon to begin.  I returned home around midnight, lay in my
bed mulling (absurdly) over possible problems that might arise on trips that
are many weeks away.  The last time I looked at my watch it was well after 2
am.

It seemed that something woke me up other than the shaking, though I'm not
sure.  It may have been dogs barking, a person yelling, or the birds.
Perhaps it was simply the first gentle movements of the quake, triggering
deeply imbedded memories and fears from the 1989 quake I experienced in San
Francisco.  I was up out of my bed, though still half a sleep, before it got
really bad.  There was a crazy mess of sounds from wood and metal, and
whatever, squeaking and creaking around me.  The movement and sounds
confused me at first, and I remember thinking for a moment or two that there
were other people in my place, and that this was the problem.  Soon,
however, there was no question what was happening.  By then I was in my
hallway, where three doorways were close together.

The first moments of a serious earthquake, when you are up in a building,
are as if the earth below is swelling, the building riding those swells like
waves.  Then it gets awful, out of control, and it is nothing at all like
the comfort of riding waves.  I felt the sickening feeling of my building
being all too easily whipped around from side to side, and otherwise.
Though it was dark, the ceilings, walls and floors all seemed at absurd new
angles vis-a-vis each other.  The shaking was bad enough I could imagine
that things might start collapsing.  From time to time I darted out of the
relatively safety of the hallway, to grab my sweats, a jacket, my bag.  Soon
the shaking stopped -- I heard it lasted some 45 seconds -- and then I
really started racing to get outside.  I must have been soaked with
adrenaline by this point, remembering to grab my Turkish dictionary, a
flashlight (which unfortunately wasn't assembled -- I did that later -- and
I had to root around the drawer for the batteries), some extra cash, even my
camera.  The electricity stayed on for a bit, which was helpful, but was off
by the time I opened my door a minute or two later.

My place is five stories up, on the top floor, and there's a veranda off to
one side.  Perhaps unwisely, though I couldn't resist, I went out on it for
a quick look out over the city.  It was dark except for a moving light here
and there, the headlights of cars.  Something may have been burning across
the Golden Horn, in the Balat neighborhood.  I could see the silhouettes of
a few of the great Mosques against a sky now full of beautiful stars.
Below, a car alarm had gone off, and people were yelling and shouting.  I
worked my way carefully down the stairs, concerned that they may have
collapsed.

I spent most of the next two or three hours with the crowd that had gathered
in the relative safety of the square around the Galata Tower (though I
occasionally shot a worried look up at that huge mass looming above us).  At
one point I took a long walk, further up my hill, then along Istiklal
Caddesi, my part of the city's main street.  Other than the electricity
being out, and the people on the streets, there was little physical evidence
of the earthquake.  Some masonry had fallen.  As I mentioned above, an
abandoned apartment was half collapsed near my place.  I saw no one hurt.
But I did saw people in their underwear, a women mumbling about Mohammed, in
one hand a water bottle, the other with its palm turned up to the sky (which
as I said was starry).  Some people were laughing, others were crying, most
were huddled together in small groups talking quietly.  Many of the women
were wearing headscarves, more than usual it seemed.  An outdoor caf? next
to the tower opened and served tea and water.  I knew a few people there
and, with my poor Turkish, learned that in was really bad in Izmit, sixty of
so miles east of here, that even here in Istanbul a few buildings may have
collapsed.  Dawn came and I returned to my apartment, slept for a few hours.
  That sleep was interrupted and made fitful by what I learned later were a
series of fairly significant aftershocks.

On the television, a crowd just burst into applause.  A young boy has been
rescued from one collapsed building.  Except for being dusty, he appears
unscathed.  As they carry him to an ambulance a reporter follows, asking him
questions.  Were you scared?  "Cok kokum [very scared]!"  He seems pleased
to be back in the world, by the attention he's getting.  Then he is asked
about his family.  His eyes grow wide, his face long.  "Annem [my mother],
kardesim [my sister/brother], sesleri duydum [I heard their voices].
Duydum!"  By the time they reach the ambulance, he is screaming.  "Sesleri
duydum!  Sesleri duydum!"

Turkiye, iyi sanslar.

Mom and Dad,

I will be sure to tell her.? Any other news?? Will send you an update soon. 
All goes well.? 

Macedonia surprisingly impressive; green valleys tucked in between 
snow-dusted mountains, neat farms and villages and?not?as desperately poor as 
I had read (at least as this all appeared from the window of the plane).? We 
happened to arrive at the same time Secretary of State Colin Powell; the 
airport was surrounded by several helicopters hovering like dragonflies; road 
into town lined with KFOR (from Kosovo, just 30 km away) soldiers and local 
police; we got delayed for 20 minutes or so as Powell's motorcade?passed, 
reminding me of a time when I was stuck in a similar traffic jam in Chicago 
caused by the passing of father Bush.? While there we met with a pimply-faced 
Minister of Transportation and?made little progress in our negotiations as 
deal breaking "collateral" issue came up;?I had a nice evening stoll through 
the old ruins of an Ottoman fort and dropped in on an Eastern Orthodox church 
ceremony (which I found beautiful though a b! it creepy, as the worshipping 
spaces in their churches are small, crowded with the pious and?made to seem 
further cramped by the smoke of incense?and walls completely covered with 
icons).? Heard no gun fire or bomb blasts from the nearby hills, where 
recently some Albanian rebels complaining of an absence of political adn 
economic rights had been trying to mess things up a bit.? I was told by 
local, non-Albanians, that the trouble had been exaggerated by the western 
press.? All very interesting.? Details will be in the book!

Love, 

Mark ???

Mom,

Your letter was wonderful.  I was "transported" to Illinois and the condo,
and got a nice glimpse of your life there.  Thanks.

I hope you get a chance (or got a chance) to read Tom's and my
correspondence.  I mentioned more than once how fun it was that Tom seemed
as excited as I was.  What a rare and special happening it all was,
especially for me in that Tom was so involved.  And what a great thing this
e-mail gadget is, and that we were ALL able to experience it more or less
simultaneously.

I don't know if you kept a copy of the Perspective section, but your can see
(generally) the area where I live in the picture of Sancta Sophia on the
first page.  If you look in the upper left-hand corner you'll see a finger
of water.  That's the Golden Horn.  (To its left, starting roughly directly
above the Sancta Sophia is the Bosphorus.)  The bridge that you see crossing
the Golden Horn (we're still in the upper left hand corner) is the Galata
Bridge.  Just above the bridge, approximately half an inch on the page is
the blur of buildings where the Galata Tower and my place are.  I live in a
neighborhood called Galata (though the sub-neighborhood is called Kuledibi).
  I'll be bringing more clear pictures, but that's a start.

It IS amazing to think you all moved to condo nearly 22 years ago.  Its also
amazing to think we all moved to Illinois only some 12 years before that.
It seems like those 12 years were a lot longer than the 22 since.  Time is
cruel, I think.  Your initial experience of cold, discomfort, rang a bell
for me too.  When I moved in here it was also middle of winter (although
Istanbul winters not quite as bad as Illinois winters; more like New York I
think).  Had very little furniture (i.e. nothing really).  Ismail and I did
bag a bed and, as I half-mentioned in the article, he and his wife lent an
excellent comforter and another blanket to me.   I rely on heaters here, as
no centralized heating.  At that time, along with the bed, I had bought a
gas heater, which you're not supposed to use at night (in case there's a
leak).  So the first few nights I buried my head under the blankets against
the freezing temperatures.   Since then, have fully equipped the place (e.g.
alos now have an electric heater, which you can use at night) and am ready
(clothes and everything) for next winter.  (Also will pick up a few more
things while I'm in SF.)   All this said, wouldn't have done it any other
way.  Feel I paid a few dues and am better acclimated for the experience.

Life is considerably harder here than in America, but the good life not
inaccessible.  There is everything from Marks & Spencer to McDonalds.   I,
despite living on about $600 to 700 a month, live well and better than most.
  I calculate that, provided you don't go too far up the scale, most things
are a half to a third what they cost in SF. (Toothpaste, by the way -- even
Crest -- is here in spades.)

Have you gotten a chance to talk to Jeff about his visit?

More later, and a lot of that in person.  Thanks again for the note and
sending along the article.

Love,

Mark

January 1, 2000

Earlier, with some trepidation, I turned on my laptop, opened up Word
(Microsoft's word processing program) and, once there, my journal.  I typed
in "January".  Before I could go on, however, Mr. Gates' program proudly
displayed the fact it knew where I was going, anticipating a date.  The
program guessed the date would be "January 1, 2000".  It was right.  I
smiled to myself at what seemed, at the moment, a bit of bravado.  I was
also pleased that I had apparently been left unbitten by the dreaded Y2K
bug, as had (I understood from the news reports) most of the rest of the
world.

I am happily settling down to a quiet Saturday night alone, after a
(slightly) booze-soaked Friday night of saying a great big "hey" to the new
millenium.  Last night my girlfriend Sukran and I had gone to my friend
Ismail's, joining his family and a dozen or so of his friends.  We drank
wine and raki (the Turkish version of the anise-based liquor that is
reported to have helped kill, among others, Turkey's founding father Mustafa
Kemal Ataturk).  We listened to and sang (here, I have to admit, I was still
mostly listening) Turkish songs, as well as a few by Bob Dylan (with me
privately concluding that "Blowing in the Wind", after hearing it again
after so many years, was the song of the century).

Closer to midnight we turned on the television, watched the view from the
air of Istanbul's magnificent Blue Mosque, set ablaze by its powerful
floodlights.  A smallish crowd, reported to be about 1,000, would later
watch a modest fireworks display there.  The TV switched to another aerial
view, this time of Istanbul's Taksim Square.  Though the square can fairly
described as Istanbul's Times Square, the crowd there, which I later learned
was overwhelmingly male, could not have numbered more than a few tens of
thousands.  At midnight the TV was shut off and we gathered around Ismail's
seventh floor windows.  From there we watched his neighbors, apparently
observing an age-old New Year's tradition in his neighborhood (Kurtulus),
dropped empty bottles from their windows into the street below.  The roof of
a Mercedes was dented.  Taxies wove their way between exploded bottles,
which on the pavement below -- from my somewhat alcohol-laced, seven-story
high perspective -- looked like giant snowflakes.  People hung from windows
along both sides of the street, some waving sparklers and shouting.  Passing
cars, ignoring the threat from above, tooted their horns merrily.  In the
distance was the sound of fireworks coming from Taksim and the sky, already
hazy from the ubiquitous smog, became spotted with clouds of drifting
gunpowder smoke.

As the night went on (and delightfully on) I learned that every one of the
couples at Ismail's, including Sukran and me, had had a serious fight
earlier in what was now the previous day.  I was surprised by this and
wondered (without reaching any conclusions) what it might have been about
the day that triggered such behavior.  Yet despite the troubling things
inspired by the final few moments of the last particularly wonderful and
terrible century, all were forgotten in the first few moments of the next
(and still undescribable) one -- replaced for the time being by smiles,
songs and much laughter.

And indeed it appears the night passed in a similarly positive fashion
worldwide.  Threats here in Turkey of attacks on millenium celebrations by
Islamic radicals -- apparently offended by both the booze and the brouhaha
over the passing of a date on the Christian calendar -- proved empty (or
perhaps frustrated by the conspicuous number of police).  Nothing else of
that kind, or of any other kind of awfulness, appeared to have occurred
anywhere in the world.  Even the Y2K bug seems to have been born without a
stinger.  What a nice way to start the new year/decade/century/millenium.

Howdy,

West is best, I guess, (and apparently now more ethnically mixed?)

Trip to Washington sounds great.  Once when I was there, maybe 5 or 6 years
ago, I had the opportunity to visit a congresswomen's office, as I knew an
intern there.  Was, among other things, escorted to the Capital
building(through tunnels that lead under the Mall from the various office
buildings to the Capital building) where I saw a few hours of a
Congressional debate on one of the many campaign reform bills that have
passed through those (not so hallowed?) halls.  The debate very interesting,
not the least reason being that it was made before only a couple dozen of
the 500 or so congresspeople (the rest, I was told, were monitoring the
debate on TVs in their offices).  At the few times that a quorum of the
members actually have to be present (for, say, an impeachment vote), a bell
rings and congresspeople hustle through the above mentioned tunnels to
register their vote, after which they hustle back.  It's something to see.
Good luck with the application.

YOU MUST, while in DC, see the Holocaust Museum.  I Mean MUST.  Should make
reservation (probably can use the Internet), as I understand it's booked up
far in advance.  The museum's right off the Mall so is conveniently located.
  The most powerful museum I've ever been too.

Turkish course finishes in two weeks.  Then to Israel during first week of
April, to Italy during second week.

Bursa was very impressive.  Not nearly as dilapidated as (most of) Istanbul.
  Was the first capital of the Ottoman Empire, so there are important
historical buildings from, among other centuries, the 13th.  Now, a bit of a
sprawl, and industrial. The city center sits at the bottom of the slope of a
huge mountain (its ragged, snowcapped peak breaking out of the clouds
periodically), and thus there are fine views in both directions.

More later,

Love,

Mark

February 10, 1999

I am wakened by the approaching chatter of the early morning call to
prayer (sounding a bit like the fuss made by one of those cartoon balls
of fighting dogs and cats).  From the minarets of far away mosques, the
muezzins' cries ricochet through Istanbul's still dark alleys and
streets.  Seagulls, who have drifted up the hill from the Golden Horn,
squawk contentedly outside my window.  From somewhere down below, a
miserable dog joins into the pre-dawn ruckus, soon followed by the local
muezzin, whose amplified singing drowns out all the rest.  He reminds us
that God is great and that prayer is a whole lot more important than
sleep (at least that's what I've been told; he sings in Arabic).
Because my religion thinks more highly of sleep, I feel free to simply
listen, while gently trying to pull the warm blanket of sleep back over
me.  The  muezzin has a beautiful voice.  Its rise and fall stitches
itself into the edges of a dream (in which a former best friend and I
argue about the rules of a game of miniature golf) hanging just out of
reach.

Slowly, the banal calculations that fill my days begin to crowd their
way into my head.  It's about a quarter to six, I figure, which means
there's time for a bit of writing, or even Turkish vocabulary, before I
douse myself in the shower to full consciousness.  I remind myself of
the theory that one can write most freely while still intoxicated with
sleep (or just plain intoxicated), am immediately stricken with the fear
I am incapable of such freedom, take a look round my brain for something
worth writing about (find nothing), hypothesize about the advantages of
a quick dash into the hallway to turn on the gas heater (so that when I
really get up it will be reasonably warm out there), wonder if I really
do have enough stuff prepared to fill up the two hours of my English
lesson with Suleyman, conclude that all this thinking has probably made
any more sleep impossible, then (I realize later) fall back to sleep.

                               *     *     *

My new phone [(212) 292-6486] is hooked up and I have a new internet
server, which will make it much easier to keep in touch.  Hope to attack
that backlog of responses that are due.

Keep in touch.

Mark-O

Howdy everybody,

Looks like I'll be coming to SF on September 21, then on to Chicago on
October 2.  Hope you're all one of those places at the rigth time.

Tom,

Thakns again for your concern.  You're asking a lot of good questions.

The best indication my building is ok is that its standing, and that it's
contemporaires are all standing as well.  You may have read that the
buildings that fell for the most part are of new vintage and are in the
lowlands.  Mine is neither.  Spoke to my landlord today, who is an engineer
of some sort, and for what its worth he said the building is a good one.

About shots, I got all ones recommended by my doctor before I left SF,
though he wasn't planning for one of the worst natural disasters in our
time.  I'm keeping my eye out about the how and why of the spread of the
diseases they're worried about here, but am pretty sure that one cirterion
is that you have to be pretty darn close, which I'm not.

I'm not our sticking my nose into anything, though would love to see things
up close for curiosity's sake.  Trouble is, I'd just be getting in the way,
which I don't want to do.  So will, for now, restrict myself to giving a
little cash and observing what goes on here on the home front.  The damage
really is not apparent from here.  As I mentioned in my note to dad, things
are pretty darn normal.  Expect indirect impact to be visable, like
worsening inflation for example.  But that's about it.  Will keep an eye out
for trouble, though.

More later.  Thanks again for taking the time to write.  Its always nice to
hear from you.

Love,

Mark

Jeffrey,

Just a quicknote to say hello.  Looking forward to the prophesized
letter.

You'll be interested to know that a couple weeks ago, when I was on my
way to Greece to renew my visa, passed Enron's progject at Marmara
Eregilisi, a town on the Maramara Sea, which is the same body of water
that has the island where Abdullah Ocalan ("Apo", the Kurdish terrorist)
is beng held.  Had read about the project in a Turkish newspaper
(English translation; not ready to read real Turkish newpapers yet)
earlier.  Also read an article about a study Enron did for the US
government about the natural gas pipeline from Baku through Geogia to
the Black Sea coast.  You guys are everywhere.

I also read that The Economist is sponsoring some sort of energy
conference in Ankara (which is suppose to be a gloomy sort of place;
especially this time of year) in the next few weeks.  Are you going?

Least you think all I do is read about Enron, been having the time of my
life here, which is not to say things have been easy.  But I'm still
where things like standing in four different lines at the port office to
pick up a pakage is charming.  (Besides Asia Minor being the birth place
of agriculture, democarcy and Christianity [all, albeit, in the distant
past], it was also the birthplace of buracracy [as you probably know,
the word byzantine comes from Byzantium, the name for Istanbul before it
became Constantinople].)

Hope all is well.

Love,

Mark

Hi everyone.  Things seem fine here.  Took long walks, one late last night
and one this morning, and saw little eveidence of damage.
Saw on CNN that americans say quake 7.8  Unbelievable.

My lap top running out of battery, so will just refer you to the below,
which was my reponse to my a note from my brother several hours ago.

        * * *

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; many stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half
a block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a generator and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying,
men reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs shut a door;
mistook that commotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much
like after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Mark, I have a letter here that Jeff would like to mail to you (we still 
haven't gotten him to use e-mail yet!); however, I don't have an address for 
you.  Please let me know if you have a mailing address in Istanbul, and I'll 
get this in the mail right away.  Thank you,
Sherri

      Dear Mark;  Thank goodness the election is almost over.  We ought to
have a few weeks of peace before someone will start working for 2004.
      The poles have been swamped today and I guess they expect the biggest
vote in the last 40 years.

     I am glad the election is nearly over------after almost 2 years I have
heard enough.
      I got a new tooth inlay this morning and then voted about 10:45 and
already our precinct had had over 180 voters--your mother was one as she went
before she went to the store.  I don't know who she voted for as yet. I was
thinking of putting up some cute sign like (Monica says "Back Bill"); (Nader
says "A vote for me is a vote for Bush"); (Be sure to get behind the right
Bush);(Gore is a Kunkle Head); or (Gore - Gore).  However I decided to put my
halo back on.  You realize I am joking of course.
      I watched the Northwestern-Michigan game last saturday-it had to be the
most exciting college game I have ever seen.  NW lost the ball on downs when
their star runner (he had gained 268 yards running) dropped a pass in the
endzone with no one within 10 yards.  All Michigan had to do was run the
clock down (1:45 left in game) so I turned to ESPN to try to get a Lehigh
score ( I finally did) and I never went back to the NW-Mich game.  I learned
just as I turned the radio off to sleep about 8 hours later that NW had
recovered a fumble and scored on a pass to win 54-51.  NW had beaten
Minnesota the week before on a Hail Mary pass  of 50 yards on the last play
of the game.   Incidentally Lehigh had beaten Colgate 20-14 and they are now
9-0.
     I know you are looking forward to seeing Calvin.  I wish I could be a
mouse to see that meeting. I had better leave now.  Your Mother said I should
send her love.  I add my love to that.  DAD

Tom,

I was trying to calculate how long it took just last night.  Because of the
quake and it being August, my teaching schedule is slimer than usual.  (I
had already been keeping it pretty slim [15-20 hours per week, including
preparation time].)  So I only had to work in the mornings this week.  On
Tuesday, I spent the afternoon on a first draft, probably 5 or so hours
total.  I wasn't that happy with it, as I spent too much of it synthisizing
what I had been reading about the big picture (after all, this was for a
newspaper).  That night I meet with Ismail (who, by the way, is a
journalist) and he encouraged me to write it more like I had been writing
the other things I've written since I've been here.  He was right, though I
already knew it.  (Your commments also brought this point home.)  I went
home that night and worked it over some more, until 3:00 or so in the
morning, then again the next day in the afternoon.  What does that add up
to?  The writing, maybe 12 or so hours, with some thinking and dsicussion in
between.

Hope Dad and Sue get a chance to follow this all in Alaska. There are
probably Interent Cafes there. Mom, I guess, can read it in Sunday's
paper(!).

By the way, how is mom?  With dad doing all the writing from home I don't
get a strong imression about how she is. (I had asked earlier if everything
was all right, but got no reponse to that question.)  Is everyting all
right?

More later, as I want to get this off in case you're still there (though
Ihipe you've gone home for some shut eye).  I have to sign off in about 20
minutes and get ready for my class.

Your little brother

Dad and Mom,
?
Hope Mom and Sue's trip to Florida went well, and that there were no problems 
with things like getting the correct change, etc.? I've heard that there is 
a?counting problem down there, with everyone using?different standards and 
then being stopped from doing the counting altogether.? Makes a lot 
of?trouble if all you want is a six-pack (of pop, that is) to go!
?
And Tom and Jeff's time in DC?
?
About the excess symbols that you all are getting in my email; Hotmail (i.e. 
Microsoft) recently added a more sophisitcated "Microsoft Word"-like program, 
and I suspect that Dad's computer needs a special program to filter out all 
the "infra-structure" stuff.? And guess what, (I suspect) Microsoft sells 
such a program.
?
All goes well.? Its cold here, but nothing like Chicago.? For example, it 
will go below freezing at night occasionally, hovering around the low forties 
mid-day.? Little wetness this year, which a problem given ?a shortage of 
electricity and the low water levels in the hydroelectric system.??
?
My boss turning out to be a?bit of a egomaniac.? He fired three people, in a 
huff about some little thing, over the phone on Friday (two support staff, 
one lawyer).??The lawyer, admittedly, was a joke, the?others?no great shakes 
(though, they were?as good as we've got).??The manner of their demise, 
however,?was inappropriate.??I could tell you more.? For example, I 
often?suggest that we hire more experienced lawyers, expecially given the 
stuff he has me saying in our promo materials (and the prices we charge).? He 
demures, saying that experienced attorneys have "bad habits" (like, perhaps, 
experience?; and I guess he would thus include me amongst those with "bad 
habits").? I suspect the real reason he feels this way is?that he doesn't 
want to be second guessed.? Still (though I am starting to second guess him 
more and more) he treats me well, all in all.? (One particularly ann! oying 
thing is that he?likes to remind me how the "Americans" are giving lots of 
money to the Islamic fundamentalists here and doing many other things to keep 
Turkey weak, for?the most part extreme, absurd claims.)? I will at least stay 
on for the experience and the material?(I could write a book about the guy, 
though few would believe it), and to be?able to continue work on Spot On.
?
More later.? Sorry for the ragging session, but we all need one from time to 
time.? Right?

Write often!

Just got on line.  Surprised it was possible.  Electricity out, so probably
only us with battery powered lap tops clogging things up.

Everything ok here, so far.  Got a pretty good shake.  Was out in the
streets for a couple of hours, with everyone else.  My neighborhood up on
solid rock, so things looked mostly ok.  Lots of old and bad construction
here; stones in the street.  One upper floor (abandoned) apartment half a
block from here collapsed and much debris in the stereets.  No apparent
injuries, however, in my neighborhood.  Unfortunately, other areas not so
lucky.  Saw 6.7 estimate for Izmit, the center, here (one place I passed had
a genertor and had a tv out for everyone to see).  Passed women praying, men
reading Koran, most just huddled in groups talking. Strange being in the
middle of it all with limited ability to communicate.  Know a few folks in
neighborhood and we had a few basic chats, though its amazing how much I
learned even from them.  Already knew the Turkish word for earthquake, which
is depram (revolution is devrim) and came in handy.

A few seagulls just went by and I think a neighbor down stairs up and about;
mistook that comotion for an aftershock.  A little rattled myself; much like
after SF quake.  I think memory of that still deep seeded in my
subconscious.

Again, this new technology amazes.  Better get off and save my battery.  May
need it.

Thanks for the note.  It was good to see your messages there.  I'll send
this to the rest of the family, but if they call tell them I'm ok and
worried about them worrying about me.

Love,

Mark

Mark; I bet you are having fun showing Calvin and his friend around.  Jeff
called about a week ago and your mother and I had a nice talk with him.  It
sure was good to hear from him.
     Leigh is playing Western Illinois in Macomb, IL. in the first round of
the NCAA Class 1-AA football playoffs.  I am going down to see the game
Friday and will stay over  Saturday and come home after the game.  Al Pedrick
(fraternity brother)  works at Lehigh in his retirement is coming in with the
team and I will spend spare time with him.  Lehigh was seeded 10 of 16 and
Western is ranked 7th.  Should be a good game.  The championship is scheduled
in Chattanooga on December 16 and I hope I will have reason to go.
     I will keep you advised.   MOTHER and I send LOTS of LOVE and KISSES  
DAD

Jeff,

Great to hear from you.  Things still fine in my vacinity.  Surkan and
family ok, though of course everyone is afraid, worried and sad.  The big
picture is not good.  Looks like the death toll alone will reach several
thousand, the injured over ten thousand.

Power and water back on in most of area in my area, and I believe that is
true throughout city.  Just looking at an amazing chart on TV that shows an
incredible series of some one or two dozen aftershocks, all over 4.O.  The
original one was, according to CNN, 7.8.  Some of the other scenes on the
tube are hard to believe.  I trust you'll get to see a selection of them
back there.

Thanks for the offer of help.  Don't think this disaster will be borne by
everyone, though, as it seems food, drink and everyting else available to
all but those who died.  Still, its hard not to imagine that something this
big in a place who's resources were already stretched won't result in some
serious widespread problems.  So I'll keep you in touch.

Have been composing a note to you in my head, which I will do by hand soon
and send to you with some pictures of your visit here.  Briefly, though, it
was great to see you and I am very happy that you've seen a bit about my
life here.  Enjoyed seeing Kristin and hope she had fun.  Look forward to
seeing her and the other kids soon and meeting Rebecca some day.

Say hey to all, take care and write again soon.

Love,

Mark

Dad and Mom,

Enjoy Alaska, dad.

Thanks for keeping in touch.  By the way, will be in SF starting late
October 21.  Unfortunately will have to spend quite a bit of time I'm afraid
finding new tenant, as the old one (who's been great) is moving out after a
year.  Wish me luck.

Keeping pretty well informed here.  Don't expect things to get too bad, at
least in the sense that I'll be suffering any serious deprevations.  This is
a big, cosmopolitan city (perhaps, in some ways, the most cosmopolitan city
in the world), which in many ways is quite modern (in its own, primitive
way).  Its got plenty of McDonalds, for instance, at which I can (Allah
forbid) stiffle any hunger pangs.  My friends Ismail and Sukran are looking
out for me as well, and for example talked me into staying out doors for two
of the three nights following the quake.

Its raining now and has cooled down considerably, which is great for me but
a very mixed blessing for those trying to get things somewhat back together
east and west of here.  Wish them luck. God, what a horrible thing.  Just
horrible.  I feel guilty that things in my life so normal.  And things
really are, for all practical purposes, back to normal.  How strange.

Say hey to mom.  Have heard little from or about her recently.  Is all ok?

Love,

Mark

Jeffrey,

Wow.  What can I say.  Will it help?  It covers about thirty months of
rent here (and I have a nice place), and makes it nearly certain that I
have the wherewithall to hang in there long enough to give this writing
thing an umitigated shot.  Thanks so very much.

Thanks also for for the kind words in your letter about appreciating
getting my little blurbs.  That means a lot to me.

Your letter capped what was one of my best days here (and I have had a
lot of great days here).  Have met a "harika [wonderful]" Turkish woman,
and had just spent a fine evening with her when I came home and found
your letter.  Her name is Sukran (pronounced "Shoo-kron").  More about
her later.  I have to admit that I cried a bit after I opened your
letter; the culmination of a lot of fantasitic feelings.

It would be great if you got over here.  It's really an endlessly
facinating place, and I think I'm becoming a prtty good guide.  (Also,
Sukran should be helping my Turkish a lot.)  Let me know as far ahead of
time as possible so I can sure you have the best choices of hotels.

I know my blurbs suggest greyness, but that's the most interesting color
for me.  As I mentioned in my last e-mail to you, I'm having the time of
my life.  Indeed, today is the first real day of spring here (though it
may be a false one [ it snowed pretty hard just two weekends ago]) and I
actually sat out in the sun on the porch next to my place and studied
Turkish and prepared my next English lessons.

I recently sent Kristin an "introduction to Istanbul" e-mail (we just
got in touch by e-mail after the holidays); you may want to ask her to
run off a copy for you (assuming she saved it).

Hope you're enjoying your work.  Let me know what else is happening in
your life.  Thanks again for everything.

Love,

Mark

Tom,

Below is Bill's latest response, and the edit.  They made very few changes.
How about that.

It strange to think that right now, as I write this, you are on the set at
WGN, in the middle of the news program, perhaps putting a few finishing
touches on your graphics.

Just as I got up a few minutes ago (I got up early, which is the best time
to get through to the line I share [and also because I'm excited[), and at
the exact time I turned on the computor there was a flash of lightening
outside.  Then, moments later, just as a healthy downpour began, the muezzin
started singing outside.  (This is true, no lie.)  I thought to myself I
hope there aren't any more cosmic coincidences (such as a ..., well you
know).

I'll be on line for a bit, so maybe we'll be able to "talk" on this thing
almost as if in person.

Love,

Mark

Tom,

Once again good to hear from you.  Still no electricity or water, though
again luckily lap top battery working.  I am also surprised able to get on
line and get through.  Once electricity goes back on will probably have a
tougher time getting trhough.  A bit ironic.

Took a long walk around this morning, crossing the Galata Bridge into Old
Istanbul (my neighborhood can't be called young) and saw little evidence of
damage.  Suspect most of it in new construction areas out on the edge of
this huge metropolitan area, where conrers get cut.  This is a poor country
with a lot of folks struggling just to put the flimsiest of roofs over their
head.

Knock on wood, but think you can all rest easy.  Doesn't seem to be any fire
risk nearby, etc.  Your right about nighttime timing; was on the darkened
deck of a ship in a mighty stormy sea.  CNN says 7.8 or somthing in Izmit
(65 miles east of here)!  I'm on the top floor and had all kinds of images
going through my head, as you can imagine.

More later.  Love you too and looking forward to seeing you in October.

Mark-O

Mom and Dad,
?
Off tomorrow to Macedonia to finish up negotiations with the government there 
regarding the "purchase" of state-owned property on which our client wants to 
build a hotel.? I drafted the contract, which was interesting because the 
country still has laws that do not allow the private ownership of 
property.??Will be interested to see if any bank will lend?money that is 
secured by such a wishy-washy?property right.? Great stuff.? Be back late 
Friday.
?
Love to all, 
?
Mark

Hi everyone,

One of my fellow Turkish students had a fancy camera, and took a picture
of me on top of a mountain above Istanbul on the Asain side.  He sent it
too me via e-mail, and now I'm trying to send it to you.  The version I
have isn't very clear, but what the heck.  The water you see behind me
is the Bosphorus, which is a 19 or so mile finger of water that connects
the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, in the process splitting Istanbul
in two.  The bridge you see is (cleverly) called the Bosphorus Bridge,
and looks a bit like a silver version of the Golden Gate, and the
portion of Istanbul beyond is European Istanbul.

More later.

Mark-O

Mom and Dad,

Got mom's letter last week; and it only took about a week to get here.
Thanks.  Enjoyed the pictures of Tom.

Mom, you're right about a place to live.  Have a good one here.  A bit
raw by US standards, but perfect for me.  Older building in interesting,
"real" neighborhood; aesthetically pleasing apartment, with wood floors,
ok molding, and super excellent, quintessential Istanbul view.  There
are twelve apartments in the building, most of which are rented by
Moslem families (veils and all).  A couple are used for storage by local
businesses and one is rented by an English journalist.  Will get some
pictures to you someday soon (though not taking many photos so far, as
want to experience this place as much in my brain, where the words are,
as is possible).  Took a while to get my place reasonably comfortable,
as had to buy furniture, etc, but that actually a lot of fun, in a way.
Part of the experience, and I learned a lot.  Even had to install my own
light fixtures.  No central-heating, so use one natural gas and one
electric heater.  Ismail was/is very helpful in all ways, both with
technical support and with help finding bargains.  I've been very lucky.

Not "running" around too much.  Indeed, literally can't run.  Otherwise,
my new hips performing flawlessly and thrilled at the absence of pain
and how strong they are.  Hoping to find an affordable pool around here,
but such things not high on Turkey's needed infrastructure list.  Except
for super expensive pools in the luxury hotels ($25/day), very few pools
in Istanbul.  (Sorry Dad, no golf courses either.)

Haven't worked too hard on trying to paint the "big picture" in my
little blurbs.  But generally, go to Turkish classes three mornings a
week, starting at nine o'clock, for four hours each day.  Study a least
that much on my own, not including trying to have "real life" Turkish
lessons.  Work about 15 hours a week, not including preparation and
travelling time, which almost doubles that figure.  (Since each work
session usually only two hours, spend an inordinate amount of time on
unpaid travelling; so far that's ok, as I enjoy the travelling, because
I get to see odd parts of Istanbul.  That bit of charm will probably
wear off over time.)  Have enjoyed figuring out the transit system, and
have gotten pretty good at using the buses, metro, the dolmas (something
in between buses and taxis).  Cook at home a few times a week -- pasta,
rice and veggies; things like that (there are tiny bakeries and
vegitable stands everywhere)  -- though eating out here can be really
cheap and interesting.  Have two really good Turk friends now; Ismail
and a wonderful women named Sukran (pronounced "Shookrahn").  Spend very
little time with yabanci (foreigners, like me).  We spend a fair amount
of time in cafes (which are bountiful and central to life her) talking
about writing, politics, Turkish, etc.  At least once a week I go on a
long walk through a part of the city I haven't seen yet.  Ismial usually
joins me.  These are always amazing and are probably the most important
part of my life here.  There's a Turkish newspaper that's written in
English, which I try to read most days.  Most days I also visit New York
Times and CNN web cites.  As you can see, taking this all very
seriously, am very busy and am loving every minute of it.

More later.  Working on a blurb about a strange religious holiday we're
in the midst of right now.

Thanks for your interest, which as I've mentioned before important for
me.  And, especially, thanks for keeping in touch.

Love,

Mark

March 28, 1999

This is the first day of the Kurban Bayram (Holiday of the Sacrifice)
and Istanbul's streets are full of folks in their holiday best.

And blood.

For days cows, lambs, goats, rams, and other big animals, have been
being brought to Istanbul from the countryside.  (I read that in Cairo
you could see people bringing their animals in by cab.)  Tent cites
(consisting of rickety structures of unlumbered wood and huge plastic
tarps) full of these doomed animals have sprung up under bridges, in
garbage filled lots and along the highways.  The city's normal perfume
of car exhaust and coal fumes is now mixed with the heavy smells of the
barnyard.

And, today, the slaughter began.

Pools of blood and rain spotted the pavement in front of my building,
evidence of a recent butchering.  On a muddy hillside in one of the
older neighborhoods south of the Halic (Golden Horn) in Eski (Old)
Istanbul, I saw several women, all smiling, surrounding a man vigorously
chopping away at the rib cage of a cow with an ax.  The cow's recently
skinned hide was spread out neatly beside them, the rest of the animal
in a heap nearby.  I passed three men loading sagging plastic sacks, no
doubt full of the spoils of a recent kill, into the trunk of a car.
(Sorry, but my weak imagination couldn't help but conjure up to images
from Scorcese's "Goodfellas".)  By a mosque, three was a lone Ram's head
under a tree.  Its snout was pointing upwards, as if thinking about
stretching a neck that was no longer there to the leaves just above it.
On the sidewalk in front of a butcher shop a man, hacking off the skin
of a decapitated lamb, rolled the body back and forth like a water
balloon.  A few meters away, a pen full of sheep ate their feed
contentedly from a trough.  I looked closely at them, was surprised to
see that they seemed oblivious to the significance of what was going on
right next to them.  Mounds of entrails lay in the gutter of one street.
I walked bye the opening of a narrow alley, from which I was assaulted
by a draft bloated with the now unpleasant order of fresh meat.  Later,
I watched, with absolutely no idea what it meant, a young man put his
fingers into the blood runoff of one butchering then walk to his car and
wipe it on the license plate.

The Kurban Bayram is an extremely important holiday for Moslems, second
only Ramadon ("Ramazon" in Turkish).  It's the time for the hajj ("hac"
in Turkish), or pilgrimage, to Mecca, which all Moslems of any means are
to make at least once in their lifetimes.  Here, in Turkey, most folks
get at least two days off work, some the entire week.  During the
holiday, throughout the Moslem world, many families buy an entire animal
for sacrifice, using only a part of it themselves, giving the bulk of it
to others, including most importantly the poor.  Some play amateur
butcher, but I have been told the vast majority of them have an "expert"
do it.  Indeed, the Koran demands that the sacrifice be as quick and
painless as possible.

The holiday itself celebrates the Old Testament story in which Ibrahim
(Abraham to non-Moslems) was ordered by God to sacrifice his son.
Abraham reluctantly agreed, but was given a last minute reprieve and was
allowed to sacrifice a ram instead.  It is a powerful story about belief
and faith (and must give animal rightists a few textual problems).  I
can see why Moslems have picked the story out as paramount.  It
certainly provides an interesting contrast to the New Testament story of
God's sacrifice of his son.

As I walked around Istanbul today I overwhelmed.  The city was a
slaughterhouse, full of, for me, somewhat gruesome contrasts.  Young
girls in flowered dresses and boys in tiny three-piece suits ran around
the streets laughing and playing games, with blood on their shoes.  I
passed a curious boy kicking at some unfortunate creature's stomach,
which had been left on a pile of garbage.  I saw a little girl holding
her mother's hand, smiling at me shyly, as her mom picked through a pile
of discarded intestines.

April 5, 1999

My discontent at the sights of the Kurban, I concluded later, was a bit
sanctimonious.  Americans eat considerable more meat than Turks, it's
only that in the United States the dismemberment is done quite a bit
more discretely.  But why should it be?  Isn't it a better, or at least
a  lot more honest, to understand what the animal part, and animal,
you're eating looked like when it was still alive (including rippling
muscles, forlorn gaze, and all)?  I thought of my canoe trips to Canada,
and how much more meaningful my fish dinner was because I had caught and
cleaned the unlucky critter myself.  A sharpening of reality, I think,
is always a good thing (especially in this time when so much of our
"knowledge" and "experience" comes secondhand through the media,
including, I have to reluctantly admit, my beloved books).  If our
rituals, often the most powerful means of creating reality-blindness,
can be infused with as much truth as possible, all the better I'd say.
(Then, perhaps, when those flimsy dreams we try to kid ourselves with
disintegrate like pieces of wet toilet paper....)

Today is the five-month anniversary of my arrival here in Istanbul.
It's an amazing thing I've done for myself, I think.  I am as close to
totally engaged in my life, and the world around me, as I have ever
been.  It will be hard to live any other way again, I imagine.

In the last week and a half, three terrorists here in Turkey succeeded
only in blowing themselves up, much, I suppose, to their martyred soul's
chagrin.  I've got to hope that these crazy acts are evidence of the PKK
(or whomever) being on its last legs.  There are important elections,
national and local, coming up on April 18th, so we'll probably get a
chance to see just how long those legs are.

Hope all is well.  Drop me a line.

Mark-O

Great to hear from you!  I got both messages.

How fun about Suleyman's fabric samples.  Hope they aren't the last
straw that broke the camel's back.  (Oh yeah, no camels here in Turkey;
for reference, Turkey's southern coast same latitude as SF.)  It would
be great if you two could work together.  I really like Suleyman and if
you could help him get into US market it would be a coup for him.  And,
maybe, you and Jeff will get to Turkey!  By the way (which, by the way,
happens to be Suleyman's favorite transitional phrase] Suleyman very
informal; so don't be afraid to get into an extended dialogue with him,
in which you ask a lot of preliminary questions.   Anyway, it would be
good for his English.

Thinking of you "up north" very nice.  Guess the lakes are still socked
in, but beautiful and pristine.  I spent the day in one of Istanbul's
sprawling, slapped together neighborhoods, where a lot of refugees from
the Balkins have settled over the years.  Recently, it was the site of
PKK (i.e. Kurdish] riots.  Wanted to see it.  Impressive bit of
improvising; a testimony to we humans' endless ability to adapt and make
lives for ourselves.  Think about what Istanbul's been through.  In 1970
its population was about 1.5 million.  Now its approaching 15 million,
and most of the new comers are dirt poor folks moving in from the
countryside.  It's slapped together, but works pretty damn well.  Bravo!

I guess a bomb went off nearby and someone was killed.  Always a few
folks looking for the quick reconciliation of irreconcilable, competing
differences.

All the above pretty vague; a writer's dilemma is to make it live for
the reader.  But there's just so much "stuff" that makes up any given
piece of reality, and its ultimately in the eye of the beholder anyway.
This is some thing I've set out to try and do; to get my arms around a
bit of everything!  A dwarfing, humbling endeavor; like trying to single
handedly to capture all the water from a ruptured dam.

More later.  Good luck with all you do.

Love,

Mark

Jeff,

Wanted to drop a quick note to follow up on our conversation on Saturday. 

I am definitely interested in what the plan sounds like as modified. If you 
and I can find the right combination of tasks, it should work well; the 
matters you mentioned would all seem to fit into a split schedule. 

My schedule can be as flexible as needed, with the only restriction (a big 
one, I must admit) being that I would want to spend as much time in Istanbul 
as possible, both for Sukran and me. 

As we discussed, if you and I think there is a niche that would make sense 
for me, I could be in Houston for up to six months a year. Perhaps it would 
be helpful if we initially assumed that my schedule would include one month 
in Houston then one month in Istanbul, followed by two longer two-month 
periods in Houston and Istanbul.?This?schedule could be fragmented or even 
consolidated further, and of course there would have to a fair amount of 
playing it by ear. One thing I would be trying to do as things played out -- 
provided of course that none of my projects with you was put at risk -- would 
be to shave off a week here, a day or two there, so as to maximize my time in 
Istanbul.? I would do what was necessary to have myself well-wired into the 
States, and should be able to handle quite a few things effectively even from 
here. ??

As I mentioned, I have a lot going on here these next four or five months 
getting things set up with Sukran, but I could come to Houston for a month 
here, a month there, perhaps for the first time in approximately a month. 
After that, full-steam ahead. 

You might be wondering about my present work.?I would try to hold onto the 
newsletter, as that would continue to provide a great vehicle for my learning 
and writing about this place. Otherwise, my work here is not something we 
should worry to much about as we consider the above further. 

Yours with love,

Mark 

P.S.? Enjoy the festivities in Washington and say hey to Tom.

I am writing to second all the requests you've probably hearing for money
contributions for Turkey's recovery efforts.  Turkey has a population of
some 65 million, up from only some 14 million at its birth in 1923.  The per
capita income is just over $3,000 a year, close to Mexico's.  The areas hit
so hard by the recent earthquake have experienced growth rates in the last
few decades that probably have few precedents in human history.  Istanbul,
for example, has grown from some 1 to 1.5 million people 30 years ago to
what some estimate to be a population of between 12 to 15 million today!
Most of these folks are from or are descendants of poor families who moved
from the countryside to the industrial cities looking for a better life.
The demand they created for housing, obviously, contributed to some of the
corner cutting that has exacerbated so badly the recent disaster.

I am sure you have access to trustworthy organizations through which to
distribute your contributions, but in case you don't why not try the
American Red Cross,  P.O. Box 37243, Washington DC 20013; 1 (800) helpnow;
www.redcross.org.

Thanks,

Mark-O

June 23, 1999

Home,
A sort of honor, not a building site,
Wherever we are, when, if we chose, we might,
Be somewhere else, but trust that we have chosen right.

W.H. Auden

The view from my living room, a southern view, begins with a mess of red
tiled rooftops tumbling down to the Halic (Golden Horn).  On the other side
of the Halic (a river-harbor, once beautiful and fast flowing, now stalled
and polluted) are the hills where the ancient city Byzantium (later to be
called Constantinople, later still Istanbul) was founded nearly six
centuries before the birth of Christ.  Above a cement colored smear of
apartment buildings of much more recent vintage, I can make out the outlines
of towers that were part of defensive walls first started in the 500's AD.
I can also see the massive Selimiye and Mihrimah Mosques, built in the
1500's during the reign of perhaps the greatest Ottoman, Suleyman the
Magnificent.  Otherwise, the hillsides of Eski (Old) Istanbul are covered by
the before mentioned apartment buildings, relatively new but already
appearing weary from overuse and ready for replacement.  They are, I
suppose, full of people who for the most part work far too much for far too
little and who must wonder, more and more, with each passing day, about the
relevance of their muezzins' cries.  Incongruously, hundreds, maybe
thousands, of sea gulls, screeching a bit like Halloween pranksters, dip and
rise in the air space between me and all of that.

I recently bought a cheap guitar (I left a better one back in the States)
from my friend Ilyas, and from time to time I sit looking out my window
while playing sad songs from America's south (the easiest kind to play --
slow, with three chords and, as Bono [pretentiously] said, the truth).  This
evening, I did just that, singing and playing, among others, a song by Steve
Earle, in which he laments having forgotten to say goodbye to some long ago
love ("Was I off somewhere, or maybe just too high?") and one by Lucinda
Williams, who sings about hitting the road in order to forget ("When I get
to Baton Rouge, I won't cry a tear for you").  A pile of clouds staacked up
on the horizon prevents me from seeing the sunset, but the invisible sun
still makes its presence know, bordering them crimson.  I watch the
neddle-like vapor trail of a jet crawl west -- until it too disappears
behind the clouds -- all the time wondering about when I too will be heading
in that same direction.

What will it be like to be in America again?  I don't think I've ever
developed particularly deep psychic connections with places, though that is
not to say I haven't loved the places I've lived.  I truly adore San
Francisco and I always come to Dallas's defense.  I appreciate Aurora
(Illinois) and miss Westfield (New Jersey), often wondering what it would
have been like to have finished my growing up there.  But because, perhaps,
I ultimately value experience more than comfort -- and, don't get me wrong,
I value comfort a great deal -- maybe I haven't been able to convince
myself, at some critical, fundamental level, to believe that settling down
in one place (or, come to think of it, with one person) for the rest of my
life is an  ultimate goal.  Of course, I worry about where this all might
lead, with the specter of absolute -- and perhaps, God forbid, unbearable --
loneliness sometimes seeming a real possibility.  But, then again, maybe I'm
just looking for the ultimate home, and will burrow in deeply once I've
found it.

My great buddy Misha and his wife Nina just returned to their home after
what was, for me at least, a wonderful ten-day visit.  They weren't so sure
about the Boza (a sweet, slightly fermented drink made from millet) I
accosted them with at a tiny caf? in the center of Eski Istanbul, but they
tried it anyway.  Later, forgetting about how scared I had been the first
time I was there, I think I spooked them a bit when I lead them on a
post-dusk walk through the "working class" Kucuk Pazar neighborhood (on our
way to the breathtaking interior and exterior views at the Suleymaniye
Mosque).  While passing through Kucuk Pazar, we turned into one particularly
poorly lit street and came upon a crowd of men talking and smoking in near
total darkness.  (I could only tell they were smoking by the occasional
flare of the embers at the end of their cigarettes.)  After first not
knowing what in the world we'd stumbled onto, I realized we were passing
near a hamam (Turkish public bath) -- no doubt an immensely important
institution in Kucuk Pazar, as many of the apartments there (I have been
told) have no showers.

Notwithstanding these, and a few other nonstarters, I still think Misha and
Nina's trip was a success.  We did and saw a lot, albiet while suffering
through the hot, humid beginnings of an Istanbul summer.  Probably of most
significance, to me, was checking in with Misha after nearly nine months
apart.  We had much to talk about, or at least to allude to vaguely.  During
one of our more memorable (i.e. ridiculous) jaunts into these wordy
never-never lands (which occurred on the roof porch of my building and
lasted until four in the morning), Misha was patient and courteous when I
suggested that maybe our lives are played out in the barely understood space
between an incomprehensible universe and an equally incomprehensible self.
Misha wanted to give ourselves more credit in the ability to understand
department.  In response, I referred to some of the books I've read.

This summer I will not be taking formal Turkish lessons, though I plan on
studying Turkish a lot; for example, translating newspaper articles and
writing and, with the help of Ismail and Sukran, trying to absorb more
deeply all that I have learned to date.  And I have learned a lot, including
an incredible amount of grammar and vocabulary.  Still, I wonder if this old
dog brain of mine is thinking less about the next meal than about where to
lay down afterwards.  My biggest problem -- among many, I know -- is
"hearing" Turkish.  (My two most used sentences are "Ne dediniz [What did
you say]?" and "Tekrar soyleyebilir misiniz [Can you say that again]?".)  I
will be buying a television (ugh!), as I've concluded that a television is
an important way to learn how to "hear" Turkish.

Most importantly, this summer I will finally be beginning a regular writing
program, writing for a least three hours a day, five days a week.
("Insallah [With god's help].")  That, coupled with work and Turkish (and my
reading), should keep me pretty busy and, hopefully, productive.  At least I
should be sending a few more e-mails.

More later.

Mark-O

Hello Dad;

Happy birthday.  So, it sounds like you will be "batching" it on your
birthday this year.

Read a little about the Sox here; sounds like they're up and down.

Good luck on your speech on Memorial day.  What will it be about?

How was the Lehigh frat reunion?  Are you really playing golf already?
There arn't very many courses here, but did see one recently (it was, of
course, owned by the army).

Hope mom wins the sweepstakes, and the trip to Istanbul. When is the
drawing?  (Did she get my note about mom's day?)

I brag to everyone here about you getting a computor and learning how to use
the Internet; its really quite extraordinay.  Great to be in such good touch
with you all.  Hope to get a connection to my apartment again in late June,
after which I should be able to write more regularly.

Of yeah, Misha and wife Nina coming to Istanbul in a couple of weeks.  Plan
to head out into Anatolia (Asian Turkey) for a week.  Should be great.  Will
get to seriously test my Turkish.  Looking forward to it.

Talk with you soon.

Love,

Mark-O
