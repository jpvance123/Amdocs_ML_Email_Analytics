As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Hello everyone!
Just wanted to send a quick note to let those of you who don't know already that I will be moving into a new position within the next week or so and will no longer be the Reporting Contact for the Natural Gas Teams.  I am moving over to manage the Reporting Groups for the Back Office and Group Teams.  Please welcome Laynie East as my replacement.  She can be reached at X3-3131 and you may begin calling her with any Natural Gas Team related needs immediately.
I will certainly be assisting in the transition process and will assist her with any of your requests on an as needed basis for a while.  Please forward this note to anyone in your groups who may need this information.

It has been a pleasure working with each of you over the last several months.

Thanks,
Edie

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks,


Karen B.

Hello Hunter,

Hope things are going well on your end (as well as they can be for all of us, I guess :-).  I was recently asked by Louise to return to EnronOnline from Power to help out with the re-launch under the new umbrella.  One of the things on which I'm working with Dave Forster, is to collate the various launch plans for EnronOnline, as well as the Gas and Power groups.  To that end, I would really appreciate your sparing a few minutes and meeting with me (at your earliest convenience) to chat about the plans I've seen for the Gas Desk. The intent is to polish all the plans and present them to UBS as the sale is completed.  Some of the detailed questions that came about (and re. which I'd need your help) were things like:

What will it take for us to start offering physical products on EOL?
How long would it take to obtain the appropriate permits, etc?
What documentation is required to support the application process?
Who is responsible to get these permits and coordinate this process?
Etc.

I recognize that some of these questions may not pertain to your group, and also that different desks will potentially have different requirements, but I'd really appreciate your pointing me in the right direction at least.

Thanks in advance,
Rahil

TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE
News from The University of Texas at Austin
JANUARY 2002
____________________________________________
Dear UT Friend:
Winter may be just a few weeks old officially, but spring has arrived on campus. Or at least the spring semester, which gets under way this week. With best wishes for a prosperous new year, we bring you this eclectic trio of items as the first TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE of 2002:
WHEN GOLFING GREATS BEN CRENSHAW AND JUSTIN LEONARD helped the United States win the Ryder Cup in 1999, the prize included $100,000 for each team member to donate to the college of their choice. Naturally, both Longhorns chose their alma mater, and the UT Golf for Life program was born. UT students are seeing the benefits of this collaboration with PGA of America -- one of 14 university partnerships nationwide -- including increased access to driving ranges and putting greens and personalized coaching from PGA-affiliated guest instructors. Hmmm... burnt orange plaid pants, anyone?--> SEE http://www.utexas.edu/do/impact/golf.html
THE LAST DECADE OF THE 20TH CENTURY saw celebrated Texas photographer George O. Jackson traversing Mexico to capture a visual record of more than 200 community festivals. The result is the Essence of Mexico Project, including 50,000 color images and Jackson's own copious notes on the important festivals of more than 60 indigenous Mexican cultures. This exhaustive undertaking has spawned five museum exhibitions in nine international venues. Now, thanks to Jackson's generous donation, it resides permanently in the Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collection, which is part of UT's General Libraries. The project will be archived during the next two years with Jackson's assistance.--> SEE http://www.lib.utexas.edu/about/news/jackson.html
IF YOU ARE A FAN of the University's StarDate radio program -- which is heard on 250 stations nationwide -- youmay want to check out StarDate Online, a universe of information on all things astronomical. While there, you can support science education in Texas with your purchase of the 2002 edition of the StarDate Sky Almanac. Brought to you by the folks who produce the award-winning StarDate magazine, the $4 guide contains a year's worth of skywatching information -- how to find planets, stars, and constellations, and when to watch for meteor showers -- as well as what's coming up this year in space exploration. All proceeds benefit the public education programs of UT's McDonald Observatory.--> SEE http://stardate.org

Thanks for reading TEXAS TRIBUTE ONLINE. Feel free to send us your thoughts and opinions, both on what you see here each month and in the print edition of TEXAS TRIBUTE.
See you next month.

I talked to Hunter last week.  We decided that we (gas structuring and him, each independently) will develop an outline for the project (which needs to include scope and objectives).  Thereafter, we will meet to review and finalize the plan.  Mark and Jon will be fine.  Please develop a draft outline and let's meet tomorrow (11/13) morning to review.  I would like to get with Hunter on Wednesday (11/14) after trading.   

Melissa, please get a room for tomorrow morning on 32.

If you have any questions, please ask.
Ed

Ed,

I talked to Moon about incorporating Mark Lian and Jon Horne to work on Aruba & he thinks it is a good idea.  Do you want me to ask Melissa to arrange a meeting with Hunter?

Thanks,
Kelli

Welcome to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An "Alliance MX turret quick reference guide" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as "Caller ID" and "Voicemail Indication".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network "in-building" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible "Plug n Play" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com

Hunter,

Per our conversation, in  addition to weather and basis, some classes that I feel would be of interest are the following

Option Pricing
Technical Analysis
Power Trading (Introduction)
Structuring


If I can think of some additional topics I will let you know.

Bryant.

Bob,

I talked with Hunter about the west logistics organizational chart.  We came up with the following list, which I believe matches your recommendation.

Randy Gay
Patti Sullivan
Shelly Mendel
Suzanne Christiansen
Shannon Groenewold


If we were to enter a scenario that reduced the analyst level on my desk, I would recommend that we discuss the placement of Susan Scott and/or Jason Wolfe in west logistics.  They have both performed at high level in logistics and offer the new company a longer term skill set than a few of the people listed in our west logistics org chart.

Please let me know what your thoughts are regarding the unfortunate scenario mentioned above.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

Dear Friends and Colleagues,


It's been a great run at Enron and Houston, but after three wonderful years, it's time to say goodbye.  As most of you know, I'm headed off to Harvard Business School this fall.  I have truly enjoyed getting to know each of you, and I'll miss you next year.  I want to wish you the best of luck and future success.  I'm leaving Houston next Friday, but I would like one last chance to say goodbye.  

Please join me this Thursday, May 31 at Teala's (3210 West Dallas) from 6-10pm for a Farewell Happy Hour.  I hope to see you there!


Brian

Hi Ina, 
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
Many thanks
Stuart Fieldhouse

I just wanted to take a moment to personally invite each of you to participate in the e-Speak session this Thursday, May 10 at 10:00 am (CDT).  If you have questions that you'd like to submit in advance, you can do so by visiting e-Speak on the Enron homepage.

I also wanted to take this opportunity to provide you with an update on what's happening within the Program.  Since assuming my new role at the beginning of April, I've been focusing my efforts on meeting with Enron's business unit leaders, and with as many Analysts and Associates as possible.  These activities underscore my priorities in managing the Program - a very strong alignment with Enron's businesses, and frequent / informal communication.

Some of the specific items that we're focused on as a result of your feedback, and that will be communicated in coming weeks include:
improvements to the PRC process which are in the final stages of development with the business units,
recruiting goals and strategies for the 2001 recruiting season,
a series of floor meetings beginning today to visit informally with participants in the Program,
an updated social schedule that places a priority on interaction among Analysts and Associates, as well as with the business leaders of Enron.

I'm excited that Traci Warner and Ted Bland have joined our team in the Western Hemisphere to lead Recruiting and Career Development respectively.  Together, they bring almost 20 years of Enron business unit experience, and in the case of Traci - experience as an Associate in the Program.  Anna Jansson continues to do an outstanding job leading the Eastern Hemisphere Program, and has been an great source of new ideas.  

When I joined Enron in 1992, there were about 25 Analysts and Associates combined, sitting in one group on the 30th floor.  Today, we have over 700 future Innovators and Leaders of Enron in offices around the world.  This Program has been, and will continue to be our most important source of new talent.  I'm very proud to have been asked to take this role, and I look forward to working with each of you.

Billy Lemmons

Hunter -

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron arranges first gas pipeline import into Italy
Enron has continued its pioneering activities in the Continental gas market by arranging the first gas import into Italy.  The Italian team worked with the Continental Gas desk to arrange this strategically important agreement with Blugas SpA., the wholesale gas company formed by the municipalities of Cremona, Lodi, Mantova and Pavia in north-eastern Italy.  Enron has sourced 100,000 cubic metres per day of natural gas from northern Europe to transport to Italy, transiting it through Germany and Switzerland, despite fierce resistance from Ruhrgas and TransitGas respectively.  

Aside from isolated LNG imports by incumbent monopolies this is the first time that any company has managed to import natural gas by pipeline into Italy since the Italian gas sector was officially liberalised in August 2000. The gas, which started flowing at 06.00 on Thursday 17th May 2001, will be used to meet the needs of two thirds of Blugas' residential customers within the four municipalities. The current contract lasts for five months.

Congratulations to Fabio Greco, Carsten Haack, Didier Magne, Michael Schuh, Marco Lantieri and Daniela Uguccioni.

Enron in the Middle East 
Enron has relinquished its stake in Dolphin Energy, the joint venture company formed to develop gas reserves in Qatar.
Enron has agreed to transfer its 24.5 per cent stake in the project to the United Arab Emirates Offset Group (UOG), the majority shareholder. The agreement allows Enron to deploy capital elsewhere and gives UOG the opportunity to seek new partners before the project moves into its next phase.

Development of the Emden/Oude gas hub moves ahead fast
An important milestone in the evolution of the new gas trading hub on the Dutch-German
border was reached last week. Last Friday some of the major European gas players held a meeting to officially establish the Emden/Oude gas hub. Although Enron had already initiated the development of the Emden/Oude hub by making a market through EnronOnline as early as December 2000, the goal of this meeting was to set up a working group similar to the Zeebrugge focus group who can  work on setting a legal framework for the Emden/Oude hub. 

Enron was elected as the only new market entrant in this group, reflecting the high level of respect industry peers have for Enron as a major player in the Continental gas market -- even from incumbents!

Hey Guys,
FYI - Matt Pena from the Unify team has created a fix for the Nigas nomination issue.  Cora will test this afternoon and if everything looks good we will place the fix into production.  As of this morning we are still expeciencing the same problem with the Unify system taking 45 minutes to creat a nomination.  Cora is in communication with Nigas and has kept them abreast of the situation.
Lisa

I would like to sit with Matt today and test Nigas.  I am currently trying to create a nomination for a cut we received yesterday and have been waiting approximately 30 minutes right now.  

I did speak with Judy at Nigas this morning and told her we were making every attempt to get this situation corrected as quickly as possible and she was very appreciative of that.  However, my concern is that due to the number of system problems we have had it makes it very difficult for Judy to be open to helping us out when we need a favor because she is having to deal with this on a daily basis.  

Thanks

Cora

Lisa, please have someone test this today so we can move into production. My concern is immediate based on what happened last week. As a follow-up we need to review Cora's ideas and see where they fit and decide what additional changes we will need. Just a reminder we are still in a code freeze so if these immediate changes work lets get them in and then we can revisit Cora's ideas once we are stable with SQL.

Bob

Ben has tuned the process quite a bit.  We're planning on moving it to production tomorrow.

I need someone who runs Nigas to come down today and test.  I need approval from Lisa to move this in.  We've done testing and we're confident it will work, but I want user sign off.  I realize this is difficult because you're busy, but if we could spare someone's time (about 1 hour) to come down and run the new code, we'd be more comfortable.  I've talked with Jessica and she is willing to test, but does not have access to Stage on her desktop.

Let me know.... you can always come down.

We could also look at this as a possible enhancement later on.

Donna,

As far as the Nigas meltdown on creating nominations, could we make an option on the create screen to choose a specific meter to create noms?  For example:  Nominations on Gas Exchange (Nicor's system) are all pooled by meter i.e. 3 = NGPL, 7 = Alliance, 6 = NBPL.  Every deal for every meter is pathed into or out of the POOLNICOR.  When we create nominations it creates a file that shows each meter as a separate pool and creates a nom for each pool and we transmit that flat file to Nigas.  If on the create screen we had an option to create ALL pools or specific pools that might help getting the nominations across a little faster.  They may finish up on one meter faster than they do on others.  Also, it would help when we have to resubmit because typically it is only one meter we are resubmitting and as it is now we have to create noms for all meters again.    

Thanks


Cora

Matt,

Any ideas on a long term solution.  Or do you think we should
reboot the server every night until a long term solution is found....or could you tell me how long will this reboot help minimize the problem?

This issues is not only causing the system to slow down...Logistics had asked traders to suspend trading so they could "attempt" to get their noms out timely.  Today, this issue impacted Transco's nominations too (not sure of any other late noms it may have caused).

Just an addition note:  Some of these LDCs (specifically NIGAS) will not, under any circumstance, accept late nominations.  It is critical we find a solution to this problem quickly!

Appreciate your help!

In Gas Production, we know what has caused temp_db to fill up the past two days around the 11:30 timeframe.  It's the procedure below which is called when we generate a NIGAS nomination.  Jessica has indicated that it's been running longer lately.  As a short term solution, we're asking to reboot the server tonight to allocate more disk space to temp_db.  

To do this, I need you to verify with your groups that it's okay to take the Gas Production tonight for about 30 minutes starting at 7:00 PM.  Is this okay?  Please let me know before the end of the day.  I'm having a developer from my team look into this procedure immendiately.

Ben, can you please look into this?

Title: Monthly Gas Briefing: A Late Spring Break
URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2392



Year-over-year storage numbers have benefited from record April injections. Continued fuel switching, a weakened economy, and favorable weather have contributed to a softening market, so that natural gas has been pricing below distillate. It is still too early, however, to declare summer over, and CERA believes that prices will remain high enough to keep end users off gas.

* Under normal weather, April injections have put inventories on pace to reach 2,820 Bcf by the end of October, 121 Bcf above last October.

* As summer power demand ramps up, CERA expects prices to move upward in June, averaging $4.90 for the month.

* The market remains vulnerable to price volatility, as summer power load increases could cause significant price run-ups.

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Product Side
+	List of Products	Phase 1 - First Week
				Phase 2 - First Month
				Phase 3 - First Quarter

Target Number of Transactions

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Keenan McCardell , WR JAC =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 McCardell caught six passes for 80 yards agai=
nst Baltimore. He has certainly raised the level of his play in recent week=
s, and should be a solid Fantasy player down the stretch as opponents conti=
nue to focus on Jimmy Smith.  Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/25/0=
1 Mack rushed for 50 yards and two TDs and caught five passes for 45 yards =
against the Ravens. Despite his good outing, Mack remains a Fantasy risk be=
ca! us! e of his inconsistency.   Qadry Ismail , WR BAL - Bass/Hull Updated=
 11/25/01 The Jaguars held Ismail to three catches for 44 yards. Despite hi=
s quiet statistical performance, Ismail remains a must-start player for any=
 Fantasy team. He is one of the most complete and underrated receivers in t=
he AFC.  Jason Brookins , RB BAL - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Brookins rushed fo=
r 82 yards and two TDs at Jacksonville, but also lost a fumble. The rookie =
RB is talented, but too erratic to be a Fantasy starter on most teams right=
 now.  Ron Dayne , RB NYG - Neal/McKay Updated 11/25/01 Dayne carried the b=
all six times for 26 yards against Oakland. Don't depend on him for good nu=
mbers during the remainder of the season.  Tiki Barber , RB NYG - Neal/McKa=
y Updated 11/25/01 Barber rushed for 124 yards and a TD against Oakland, an=
d caught five passes for 41 yards. He has played well recently, although hi=
s owners would still like to see him score on a more consistent basis.  LaD=
ainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/25/01 Tomlinson was held out o=
f the end zone, but he had a good day against Arizona nonetheless. The rook=
ie tailback had 145 scrimmage yards, including 13 receptions, in San Diego'=
s 20-17 loss.   Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/25/01 Flutie had a=
 solid game, throwing for 308 yards and two touchdowns against Arizona. How=
ever, he's only worth starting when the matchup is to his advantage.   Jake=
 Plummer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/25/01Plummer had a decent outing on Su=
nday, posting 241 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. Plummer, who als=
o threw two picks, is only a reserve Fantasy quarterback at best.   David B=
oston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Boston had another outstanding =
game, catching six passes for 121 yards and a touchdown against San Diego. =
He's one of the most reliable Fantasy receivers in the league, and is worth=
 starting on a weekly basis.   Willie Jackson , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Jackson had a ! go! od outing against New England, catching five catch=
es for 78 yards and a touchdown. He may not be the most dependable Fantasy =
receiver, but he is worth starting in deeper leagues.   Joe Horn , WR NO - =
Matty Updated 11/25/01 Horn had another solid outing, catching four passes =
for 97 yards against New England. He's been a very dependable receiver in r=
ecent weeks and is worth starting on a weekly basis.  Tyrone Wheatley , RB =
OAK - Giggles Updated 11/25/01 In his return from a knee injury, Wheatley c=
arried the ball five times for 17 yards. Zack Crockett was used more often =
in short-yardage packages, and Wheatley does not appear capable of starting=
 for any Fantasy team in the near future. Even when he is fully healthy, he=
 may not be able to take many carries away from Charlie Garner.  Antowain S=
mith , RB NE - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Smith had 153 yards of total offens=
e and two touchdowns against New Orleans. After a slow start, Smith has bec=
ome a pretty good weekly option for Fantasy Footballers  Tom Brady , QB NE =
- Martin Updated 11/25/01 Brady put up huge numbers against New Orleans, po=
sting 258 yards passing and four touchdowns. He's become a pretty reliable =
Fantasy player, and his performance will likely keep Drew Bledsoe on the Pa=
triots' bench for another week.  Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/2=
5/01 Gannon threw for 221 yards, three TDs and no interceptions against the=
 Giants. He ignored rain-soaked conditions, and continued to look like the =
most reliable QB in Fantasy Football.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free Agent =
Updated 11/25/01 Sanders left Sunday's game against San Diego after re-aggr=
avating a hamstring injury. He was replaced by MarTay Jenkins, and did not =
return to the game.  Eric Moulds , WR BUF - Bass/Hull Updated 11/25/01 Moul=
ds finally emerged from an extended slump, catching six passes for 196 yard=
s and two TDs against Miami. He also lost a fumble, and Fantasy owners shou=
ld still remember that Moulds has been a disappointment for most of the yea=
r. Don't be surprised if he follows his best outing of the year with a medi=
ocre performance.  Alex Van Pelt , QB BUF - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Van=
 Pelt had another fine game, throwing for 309 yards, three TDs and one inte=
rception. He is definitely merits strong Fantasy consideration as long as h=
e remains in Buffalo's starting lineup.  Oronde Gadsden , WR MIA - Matty Up=
dated 11/25/01 Gadsden caught eight passes for 118 yards at Buffalo. He did=
 not catch a TD pass, though, and lost a fumble. Gadsden is too unreliable =
to start for most Fantasy teams in these important final weeks.  Jay Fiedle=
r , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/25/01 Fiedler threw for 262 yards, three TDs a=
nd no interceptions at Buffalo. His performance may have quieted talk of a =
QB controversy, but Fiedler is still too inconsistent to be a dependable Fa=
ntasy QB.  Donovan McNabb , QB PHI - Russell Updated 11/25/01 The Redskins =
held McNabb to 92 passing yards and 39 rushing yards, with no TDs or interc=
eptions. Expect the Philadelphia QB to rebound quickly from such a quiet pe=
rformance.  James Thrash , WR PHI - Frank Updated 11/25/01 Thrash caught fo=
ur passes for 32 yards against Washington. He is too in! co! nsistent to be=
 a starter on better Fantasy teams as the playoffs approach.   Rod Gardner =
, WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Gardner caught four passes for only =
33 yards on Sunday. The rookie has slowed down considerably in the past few=
 weeks, and now seems like a risk during the Fantasy homestretch.   Ki-Jana=
 Carter , RB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Carter saw extensive action =
on Sunday as Stephen Davis played through back problems. He carried 18 time=
s for 56 yards, and is a good backup to have if Davis in on your Fantasy te=
am. Davis has always been known to battle minor injuries.  Isaac Byrd , WR =
CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Byrd started in place of the injured Muhs=
in Muhammad on Sunday. He posted decent Fantasy numbers in Muhammad's absen=
ce, catching five passes for 69 yards in Carolina's 10-7 loss to Atlanta.  =
 Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/25/01 Muhammad missed S! un! =
day's game against Atlanta due to a shoulder injury. His status for next we=
ekend's game against New Orleans is unknown at this time.   Derrick Alexand=
er , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/01 Alexander caught two passes for 56 ya=
rds in his return from a rib injury. He was not open often, and Alexander m=
ay continue to be a Fantasy disappointment if he stays healthy.  Chris Chan=
dler , QB ATL - Free Agent Updated 11/25/01 Chandler had a subpar game on S=
unday, throwing for only 132 yards against Carolina. The Falcons chose to a=
ttack Carolina with their ground game, which was the reason for Chandler's =
poor Fantasy numbers.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updated 11/25/0=

I will have the procedures for deal entry to you tomorrow.  Keith Holst is also taking a look at the current deal ticket and might be making some changes.  I'll run it by you before we finalize it.


Thanks
Kam

Hey Kirk, 
Hunter has a good point.  It would be good to have a daily report of the volumes that we could potentially lose - ie ANR SE Transmission and Gathered volumes plus Trunkline.   Kevin- this could be something that we include on fundys website (a download from Unify maybe?) - both the central and east desks could benefit.

excellent.  We need daily reports that represents the volume that we could loose.  The schedulers must know the proper rankings and cut procedures in a hurricane forms.

Hunter,
FYI - Next Tuesday we will be getting together with Tom to talk about what we will need to be prepared for in a hurricane.  We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.  This will be more efficient and accurate.  The code freeze on Unify will soon be lifted since the migration to the new server will happen this weekend.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions. 

Lisa

I view the sharing of the fundies databases and associated web sites (gas and power) with the Estate as a serious commercial issue that we should not ignore.   The estate can not only use the proprietary information as a competitor in the trading business, but they could potentially sell the data to multiple competitors.

I can't imagine that this data was agreed to be shared by UBS and the Estate.   I am not planning on giving any of the data to the Estate.   I feel very strongly about this issue and the rest of the commercial organization does as well.   One of the keys to maintaining a competitive edge in this business is our huge headstart in this area.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Dan Diamond

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel.  The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide.  The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas.

These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States.  It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways.  In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets.

Enron North America-Upstream Products
Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production.  The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. 
Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities.  In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu.  
Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.
ENA West Power
Southwest Power, an ENA affiliate, signed a 222MW 15-year tolling agreement with Allegheny Energy Supply for all of the output of Southwest's Las Vegas expansion project, scheduled for completion in September, 2002.  With the tolling agreement done and construction underway, the project will now be marketed to qualified generators.

IN THE NEWS

"To truly understand Enron's Jeffrey Skilling - the hypersmart, hyperconfident chief executive of what may now be the largest energy trading company on the planet - head to your local video store and check out that classic American cinema, Wayne's World.  At 15, Skilling helped launch a no-budget television station in Aurora, Illinois - the very thing that Mike Myers and Dana Carvey so famously spoofed on Saturday Night Live and in two movies.  The TV skit even begins with a sketch of a teenage cameraman, the role of the real-life Skilling." --- Randall Lane, Worth Magazine. May 2001.

Calgary, Alberta -- Enron Canada has settled its lawsuit with NGX, Canadian Enerdata, OM Gruppen and Richard Zarzeczny, regarding the compilation and methodology for calculating the Alberta natural gas price indices published by the Canadian Gas Price Reporter.  By the terms of the settlement there will be a joint press release issued regarding the settlement, which is to be the only public communication regarding the matter unless agreed to by all parties. Otherwise the settlement is confidential to the parties.  Accordingly, there is to be no formal or informal discussion with media, colleagues, competitors, counterparties or otherwise.

NUGGETS & NOTES

Reminder:  Brown Bag Lunch, Thursday, May 17 at 11:30 AM in 5 C2. The speaker is Michael L. Miller discussing Principal Investments.

"Historically, Newsprint has been sold under strong relationships as a highly differentiated, branded product to "very discriminating" buyers at newspaper publishers. EIM believed differently.  By the end of March, EIM had succeeded in closing on its 2nd Newsprint mill, making it the 7th largest Newsprint manufacturer in North America.  Remarkably, in just 2 months, EIM's Newsprint team has succeeded in closing $100MM total notional value "Enron commodity style" fixed price contracts with terms of 1 to 5 years?..and they said it wasn't a commodity."

NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH

Enron closes major coal deal in Germany
After almost six months of negotiations, Enron's coal team has signed a contract with Stadtwerke Bremen to supply this major German municipality with coal until 2006. Under the deal structure, Enron will deliver a total of 4.6 million tonnes of coal - equivalent to an overall contract volume of almost $200 million  (DM 440 million).

The agreement represents Enron's first significant long-term coal supply deal in Germany. The annual contractual volume amounts to around 3% of total German coal imports and provides us with continuous volume flow in Northern Germany, enabling us to grow our position in the market.

Parallel to this deal, Enron also entered into a separate agreement with HMS Bergbau Agentur, a company specialising in Polish exports. Under this agreement, HMS will be the handling agent and a potential supplier of Polish coal to us over the lifetime of the contract.

Congratulations to the whole team involved: Sven Becker, Manfred Ungethum, Cornelia Luptowitsch, Peter Bradley, Jez Peters and Michael Schuh.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Frank,
I would like to discuss with Gregg Penman (General Manager, enovate) the shift of responsibilities to you and determine if agreement changes to be made.  Additionally, if Enron determines this is the right move, we will need to meet with Peoples to usher in the change.

Thanx for your consideration in contemplating the effect on the customer in the Enron shift of people/responsibilities.  Please let Gregg assist you in this change.

Laura Luce

Laura,
Vlady has requested that I take over the CRO function for Enovate.  I'm thinking about traveling to Chicago next week to review related market risk issues, and get a feel for any other risk issues.  Additionally, what do you think about getting together with some of the People's people?    Any other suggestions or ideas to add/take off my agenda?

Frank

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.

The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:

Week of Jan 14:

Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".

A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.

The Splash page will look something like the following:

 


A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"

Week of Jan. 21:

If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).

We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.

General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
		

Trading/Origination Coordination

Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.


NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:

For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).		

Teresa Mandola (39807) - Power
Kara Boudreau (30570) - Gas
Jennifer McQuade (53614) - Power
Dan Diamond (39673) - Gas


Definitions:
	
Password Application (PA) - Only document where a physical signature is required  by an authorized person (Master User)

Electronic Trading Agreement (ETA) - Must be accepted online by the Master User before they can proceed into NetcoOnline

Master User - Typically the company authorized signatory that signed the Password Application. Establishes transaction rights for each trader (sub-users)

Sub-User - Trader, assigned either execute or read only status 

General Terms & Conditions (GTC) - Document that governs online trades unless a Master Agreement is in place

Master Agreement - Document that governs online and offline trades and supersedes the GTC

I just got the latest and greatest:

Shively
Storey
Lewis
Pimenov
Mahmassani
Williams

Assuming this is accurate, I would like to get from you, as soon as the decisions have been made, what products/regions each trader will be assigned to.  This is not only for EOL setup, but also for curve files and P&L/Position reporting.  There will be two people, not including myself to run the Central books, so I also need to begin thinking about who will be running each book.  Thanks.

And boy, does this look general.  As we all know, the devil is in the details.  Keep me posted as things start to materialize on the structure.

You know, you are the scoopmeister.

Aquila and NiSource Form Alliance
KANSAS CITY, Mo., Jan. 14 /PRNewswire/ -- The Aquila subsidiary of UtiliCorp United (NYSE: UCU <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ucu&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/u/ucu.html>) and NiSource Inc. (NYSE: NI <http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=ni&d=t> - news <http://biz.yahoo.com/n/n/ni.html>) today announced the formation of a unique alliance under which the two companies will seek to capitalize on market opportunities and deliver comprehensive energy solutions by leveraging the capabilities and knowledge of the two companies. The details of the alliance are being developed and will be provided as they are available. 
``The NiSource-Aquila alliance will be a powerful partnership to address the dynamic requirements of the energy marketplace,'' said Robert K Green, Aquila's chief executive officer. 
``It will bring together a world-class owner and operator of energy assets with a world-class risk merchant, enabling both companies to optimize NiSource's assets and manage risk for the benefit of shareholders and customers alike.'' 
Commenting on the alliance, Gary L. Neale, chairman, president and chief executive officer of NiSource said: ``This alliance will allow the two companies to focus on their individual core businesses and combine their complementary expertise to leverage the value of NiSource's uniquely positioned asset base and Aquila's extensive merchant capabilities to create greater value, with less associated risk, than either company could achieve on its own.'' 
NiSource's operations are focused in the high-demand energy corridor that stretches from the Gulf of Mexico to New England. This region represents 30 percent of the nation's population and accounts for 40 percent of the nation's energy consumption. 
NiSource is the third-largest natural gas distributor in North America, the second-largest holder of gas storage and the largest gas producer in the Appalachian basin. The company also owns and operates 16,500 of interstate pipeline and electric generation assets in northern Indiana. 
Based in Kansas City, Aquila is a leading wholesaler of natural gas and power in North America and a provider of risk management services. Aquila also provides wholesale energy and risk manager services in the United Kingdom, Germany and Scandinavia.

14:01 19Nov2001 RSF-INSIDE FERC: Midwest-Market 2: Lack of sellers forces high Enron bids - PGN311

Washington (Platts)--19Nov2001/301 pm EST/2001 GMT 

One trader said that she found arbitrage opportunities on some of the online platforms, capitalizing on a 5- to 6-ct differential between prices posted on EnronOnline and those on IntercontinentalExchange. She confirmed that few market players are willing to sell to Enron, which is forcing Enron to bid at a premium. 


Spot prices on ANR Pipeline in Oklahoma ranged from about $1.75/MMBtu early in the morning to about $2.36/MMBtu late, up from Friday's range of $1.38 to $1.58/MMBtu.

Hi Ina, 
My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
Many thanks
Stuart Fieldhouse

ADVISORY
January 21, 2002

Nicor Gas is anticipating warming weather trends throughout the remainder of the week and into the weekend.  This weather pattern will lower sendout volumes.  Nicor Gas is advising shippers it may be forced to limit specific pipeline receipts in order to manage storage activities.

We ask that shippers do not increase total nominations to our gate.

We are providing this notice so those shippers will be prepared to make arrangements in the event further action is required.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Following our discussion this morning we discussed and agreed in principle, the following changes to the "standard" contract form with UBS:

1 - Involuntary Termination
Change for all contract to 90 days. Wording 99% agreed.

2 - UBS "free" option beyond March 15
Change to March 22 and make mutual. Wording 95% agreed.

3 - Non-compete to exclude Enron retrospective reference
Re-wording of this clause to focus on NETCo and ENA rather than Enron. Wording 50% agreed.

4 - Miscellaneous clause
Change to clause that says ee reps they know of no claims, grievances, to be changed to "against individual". 100% agreed.

5 - Recognition of prior Enron service wording
Added to contracts. Wording lifted from offer letter. 100% agreed.

While we have agreed to above, please bear in mind:

- Contracts will now be delayed until wording is finally signed off by lawyers (eta 3 hours)
- We have to draw the line on further changes en mass now or we won't get anything done.
- We have not "agreed" salary and promotions completely. UBS are concerned about percentages of a few. I think we will have resolution this evening.
- I am not expecting new docs until late this evening.

David

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 23, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Thanksgiving Football   ? Sortable Standings   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Thanksgiving Football     Remember that two NFL games will be played on Thursday: Packers vs. Lions at 12:30 PM ET and Broncos vs. Cowboys at 4:05 PM ET. Fantasy 2001 players, if you have players from these four teams on your roster, they must have their final status (active or reserve) set 5 minutes before the start of their game. Please keep in mind that you also will not be able to enter any new add/drops for the week starting one hour prior to Thursday's first kickoff. Football Commissioner players, check with your league's commissioner to see how your lineup deadline is handled this week.  	


    Sortable Standings     Did you know that every column on your Standings page is sortable? Click the category name at the top of any column to sort the report by the results of that category. In head- to-head leagues, the Standings report is displayed in order of the teams with the best win/loss percentage. However, you can click the PF (Points For) column to display the top point-scoring teams at the top; or the PA (Points Against) column to display, in descending order, the teams with the most fantasy points scored against them.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Marcus Howell     Who would you start in Week 11: Brian Griese  at Dallas or Jake Plummer at San Diego?    Answer - GG     Griese's receiving corps has been crippled by injuries  this season, and with Rod Smith questionable with an ankle  injury, the outlook gets dimmer. The Denver QB has been  bothered by physical problems this year as well. Plummer  seems like a better choice after a superb Week 10 outing. But  remember that he was facing the 0-9 Lions, and Plummer has  never been able to string many good performances together in  the past. He will be facing a San Diego defense that will be  primed for a good performance after getting burned badly by  Oakland last week. Go with Griese, who should at least post  respectable numbers at Dallas.  	


  Question - Eric Fernau     Which three running backs should I start?  I  have Corey Dillon, Ricky Williams, Duce Staley, Priest  Holmes and Garrison Hearst.    Answer - GG     Dillon is a must-start player every week. Holmes is  facing a Seattle defense that looks good statistically, but  will have a lot of trouble containing him on the outside.  Staley should have little trouble ripping through the  Washington front wall. It's hard to ignore Hearst at  Indianapolis or Williams in any week, but we like Dillon,  Holmes and Staley, especially the latter in an NFC East game.  	


  Question - Jay Rassat     Who do I start this week at quarterback? I have  Tom Brady, Aaron Brooks and Trent Green. The defenses they  play against are all decent (N.O., N.E. and Seattle).    Answer - GG     Brady and Brooks square off against each other, and  each is facing a secondary that can give up the big play.  Green will be facing a Seattle team that won't offer much of  a pass rush, but he is less explosive than Brooks or Brady.  With Brady having the advantage of playing at home, and Drew  Bledsoe looking over his shoulder, we'll go with the New  England QB.  	


    Tip of the Week      Ryan Carter, Watertown, CT: Ricky Watters' decision to not  have shoulder surgery is bad news for him, but great news for  people like me, who have Shaun Alexander. I would not be  surprised to see Watters not play again this year. Ricky's a  great back, and I wish him well, but you cannot replace a  back like Alexander.

"ADVISORY"
 January 10, 2002

Nicor Gas has realized over the past days-warmer weather, lower sendout volumes and lower than anticipated storage withdrawals.  Currently the weather forecast into the weekend would continue this lower sendout volume trend.  Nicor Gas is advising shippers that it may be forced to limit specific pipeline receipts in order to manage storage activities.

We ask that shippers do not increase total nominations to our gate. 

In addition, Nicor Gas advises shippers to limit pipeline nominations into our systems, specifically receipts from the following pipelines, Alliance, ANR and Northern Border.  If shippers voluntarily limit nominations on these pipelines through and including gas day Monday January 14, 2002 no further action will be anticipated. 

We are providing this notice so that its shippers will be prepared to make arrangements with other pipelines.

Can you please let me know the position where the new plasma will go ?

IntercontinentalExchange is pleased to announce  that weather swaps trading will be included in its new version 8 release. These  fixed-for-floating financial products will be cash settled on a five-day average  temperature, Monday - Friday, for the current week and for the forward week.  Temperatures used for the settlement of these products will be those reported  by EarthSat, a widely recognized and independent source of weather data. Settlement  temperatures provided by EarthSat will be available via the IntercontinentalExchange  website. The hub locations for weather trades will be the primary airport weather  stations at Chicago-O'Hare, Dallas-Fort Worth, New York-La Guardia, Philadelphia-International  and Sacramento-Executive. The standard contract size for all locations will  be $10,000 per degree Fahrenheit, with a tic increment of 0.1 degree Fahrenheit  or $1,000. There are no payout limits on the contracts. 
The design and development of these new weather  products was done under the guidance of Aquila Energy Marketing Corp., a recognized  leader in weather product concepts. In addition, IntercontinentalExchange has  worked with Aquila and other major weather market participants, including Reliant  Energy, Mirant Americas, and El Paso Merchant Energy, to build consensus and  support for these new products.

The first quarter of 2001 was a record quarter for the performance of the businesses under the Enron Global Markets group.  We posted a gross margin number of $100 million for the first quarter.  This represents a 38% increase in gross margin after a very successful Q1 of 2000.  When combined with outstanding results posted in December of 2000, EGM has contributed over $187 million to the Wholesale group in the last 4 months.  This was due to tremendous contributions from each business group.

In order to keep the momentum going and to facilitate more growth, the following changes and additions have been made within the organization. 

Crude and Products group
Mid-marketing
Bill Berkeland has joined the group and is responsible for creating a focused mid-marketing function specifically within this group.  Fred Lagrasta is responsible for mid-marketing for Enron Americas and still maintains some responsibility for various contacts and deal flow as well.  The purpose of this group is to be very focused in the development of crude and product specific products and services.  This group reports to Randy Maffett.  

Origination
In order to manage the increased origination opportunities around the world, the Origination group has been changed in order to insure that the proper focus is placed on these opportunities and to manage its wide scope.  Doug Friedman will lead our NGL and Petchem origination efforts reporting to John Nowlan.  Joining Doug will be Rick Cantrell recently hired from Union Carbide.  The global crude and products origination group has added Randy O'Conner from Red Meteor, who has extensive experience in these markets.  Both Randy and Doug Leach's growing fuels origination group will report to Randy Maffett. 

Trading
Lee Jackson will assume the role of U.S. NGL's lead financial trader, supported by Chad South.  The petchem and plastic trading businesses have been reorganized under Stuart Bland.  Alan Engberg will be responsible for plastics trading in the Americas.  

Shipping
Scott Moncrieff will assume responsibility of our global shipping network related to crude and products.  Scott will be charged with expanding all aspects of the shipping portfolio taking advantage of our growing presence in these markets and the successes we have had marketing shipping on line.

Weather
The weather group under Mark Tawney's direction is expanding its efforts around the world.  Europe will have an expanded focus and the London office will focus on new opportunities in Europe.  Paul Murray has joined Enron from Castlebridge Partners and will be moving to London to develop and expand the continental opportunities.  Ross McIntyre, currently based in London, will report to Paul.  Bill Windle has joined the weather group and has responsibility for origination activities for North America.  Bill's most recent assignment has been in the EBS organization.  The Oslo weather office managed by Thor Lien will have responsibility for Scandinavia weather activities.  In addition, employees are being added in the Australia and Japan regions.  We are now making markets in 32 cities around the world on EnronOnline.  

Coal
Mark Schroeder has joined the coal group and is responsible for origination activities with generators in the U.S.  Mark's most recent assignment was as the head of all regulatory activities for Enron Europe, Japan and Australia.

Enron Japan
The momentum of power deregulation process has slowed in Japan.  The decision has been made to scale back the wholesale power activities.   Joe Hirl, President and CEO of Enron Japan, will now report into the EGM organization.  Joe will maintain his direct responsibility of the office and will be increasing his focus on the business lines within EGM.  All of these products have high growth potential in both the near and long-term and he will coordinate and help implement with all the business lines and their activities.

LNG
LNG continues to expand with the vision to increase the number of transactions and create a portfolio of assets and contractual access around the world.  Jonathan Whitehead has joined the LNG group and has responsibility for all trading and shipping activities.

Neal Gerstandt, previously an independent energy consultant,  Jared Kaiser, from Enron Americas - East Gas Desk, and Kurt Lindahl, from Enron Global Assets, have also joined the LNG group with responsibilities in the area of origination in the Western Region.

Enron Freight Markets
EFM has concluded over 2,000 transactions in its first two months.  Chris Kravas continues to focus on building the spot trading and mid-market capabilities that will enable it to be the dominant player in its market, and has hired four new traders in the last two weeks.  Kellie Metcalf, from EBS, has joined Shawn Cumberland's origination effort, and Deirdre McCaffrey, from Gas Structuring and Mid-Market, has joined Matt Arnold's forward trading group focusing on diesel products.  

Global Risk Markets
David Hoog joined Enron from Ace Insurance in December 2000 and has quickly built a team of people specialized in trading unit contingent power price call options, a hybrid insurance derivative product. Drawing on Ace and Enron resources, this team is based in New York and includes Alex Tartakovski and Larry Marcus from Ace, as well as Joana Bekerman and Tony Chang who recently moved to New York from Houston. Their first transaction closed just 3 months after startup.

Brad Blesie will be moving to London in June to establish a base of operation for GRM and expand our insurance derivative activities into the European market place. Among the opportunities he is currently exploring are contingent call options applied to shipping and charter rates, trading insolvent insurance claims, and combining North Sea oil and gas VPP risk with decommissioning insurance.

In April this year, EGM established a hedge fund origination effort in New York reporting to Per Sekse and led by Russell Dyk who recently moved to New York from LNG in Houston. Russell is responsible for expanding our commodity trading relationship with hedge funds to include crude oil, products, liquids and other commodities traded by EGM. Joining Russell in this effort is Stephen Plauche, who comes to us from Enron Americas' power trading desk.

Financial Trading
Elsa Piekielniak has assumed responsibility for Enron's developing agriculture business.  Billy Lemmons has changed groups and now runs the Analyst and Associate program for Enron Corp.  

Please congratulate everyone on their new assignment and we look forward to the continued growth in all the EGM businesses.

NEW FEATURES
from The Wall Street Journal


Dear Subscriber:

I hope you've had a chance to try out the new Wall Street Journal
Online since we introduced it January 28. If you haven't done so, I
encourage you to visit http://online.wsj.com and see what your
fellow subscribers are talking about - from home-page
personalization to improved links in articles to more intuitive
navigation.

We've seen many of you taking advantage of the personalization
features to have home-page access to your regularly used news
categories and portfolio. Remember you can set up personalization
by using Setup Center or directly from different pages of the site,
using the "Add to Personalized Home Page" link on industry and topic
pages. If you aren't seeing your portfolio on your home page, use
the "Layout" option in the Setup Center and click "Show" on the
buttons for Portfolio, then click Save Settings.

We know that with such a major step forward in design and
functionality some people may have trouble finding their favorite
content or features at first. We hope long-time subscribers will
appreciate the new labels for sections, which many users - new and
old - have indicated they find faster and more intuitive than the
original navigation.

One feature that I hope you have found by now is the "In Today's
Paper" page available from a link right below the main left-hand
section navigation. At a glance, this page allows you to see the
articles that appear on the print Journal's section pages, including
Marketplace, Money & Investing and Weekend Journal on Fridays. We
also provide links on this page to the past several days, and we're
continuing to build up the archive of previous days. (You'll also
find Page One articles listed on your home page directly below the
What's News column.)

+ Opinion is where you'll find Wall Street Journal editorials,
commentaries and op-ed columns. It's on the main section navigation.
+ Quotes & Research encompasses all of the in-depth company
information you may have known as Briefing Books. Use the upper-right
Quotes & Research form to get started.
+ Archive Search, available on the Advanced Search page linked from
below the upper-right search form, provides access into the premium
20-year archive of Journal articles and more than 6,000 other sources
formerly known as Publications Library. It's provided in conjunction
with Factiva, a Dow Jones-Reuters company.

We made substantial changes to our systems to support the new Online
Journal, and we've been working around the clock to ensure that you
find every aspect of the site a more useful experience. For more tips
on how to make the most of the new Online Journal, go to
http://public.wsj.com/tour

As always, we appreciate knowing what you think. Write me at
nbudde@wsj.com.

Sincerely,

Neil F. Budde
Publisher, The Wall Street Journal Online

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

This appears to be the extent of the damage.  I have spoke with Peoples to ensure joint cooperation on this ordeal.  Peoples is dealing with a union walk-out of their own involving over a thousand union employees.

Just a FYI...

Hey Hunter,

Okay here are the Secrets I have learned from Reminiscences of a Stock Operator:  You have any more?

Real money is made on understanding market trends not individual fluctuations
Understand the power of large market participants.  Try to achieve their power. 
Never Buy on a Tipster
If something is wrong and you don't know why get out
Understand  your physiological and psychological gut for a stock

JJ

FYI, looks as if they are eager to completed this before Friday.   Chris, I can't say much 
as far as the applications go, but we should be concerned about the content
on the websites that your Fundamentals teams developed.  We can talk more in the morning.

Importance:     High 

It turns out we need to build out a copy of the Gas Fundamentals for both Estate and NetCo.  The Estate instance must run on Estate Servers instead of being co-hosted on NetCo clusters.  I have attached an report image of the servers that were previously listed in the Assets Database as a starting point. 

By tomorrow morning's meeting we need to the have the following questions answered: 

Are there servers available for the separation ? 
How long will it take to configure both Estate and Netco Instances ? 
When will each environment be available for testing ? 
When can we have test plans completed ? 



<< Application Inventory.rtf >> 

Sorry for the last minute notice.  This is a "HOT" item that we need to have resolved ASAP.

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

Hey Hunter,

I wanted to see if you'd be interested in Coffee sometime soon.  I have a couple directions that I could pursue right now and wanted to bounce them off of you to get your perspective.  I really respect your opinion and I'd love to get your take if you have some time.

Jason

Please note that enovate's general managers have informed Trading Risk
Management that the enovate DPR will reflect a short "net open position"
that will exceed the enovate Board's approved 10 BCF.  This situation will
arise due to the efforts of the trading group to unwind enovate's positions
by moving inventory of approximately 14 BCF out of the NGPL NSS account to
PGL.  This action will leave the "short" hedged positions held against these
NSS volumes in the EMW trading book without the physical offset, creating a
short net open position on the enovate DPR.  ENA has agreed to terminate the
"short" hedges under the "rights of termination" provided them under their
forward contracts. It has been agreed that the termination of these short
forward contracts will occur at the same time that title to the NSS
inventory is transferred. When that termination is completed, the short "net
open position" on the DPR will drop to near zero.  Since this is a temporary
situation which is being managed for the specific purpose of unwinding the
enovate positions, the enovate Board  is approving an exception to the 10
BCF limit only for this transaction to be consummated."

  Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Smith will return to t=
he lineup Sunday against Philadelphia after missing two games with a sprain=
ed right knee. Cowboys Head Coach Dave Campo said after Fri! da! y's practi=
ce that Smith would "be ready to play the majority of the game." His return=
 bumps Troy Hambrick to fullback, but we wouldn't recommend you use either =
back against the stingy Eagles rush defense.  Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Free=
 Agent Updated 11/16/01 Sanders (hamstring) was added to the NFL injury rep=
ort on Friday and is now listed as questionable for Sunday's game against D=
etroit.  However, if you're completely desperate for a wideout in a larger =

s worth considering as long as he's able to play.    Chris Weinke , QB CAR!=

's not worth starting on your Fantasy team.   Daunte Culpepper , QB MIN - G=
iggles Updated 11/16/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season des=
pite the lack of consistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one o=
f the better quarterbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and sho=
uld be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - =
Tori Updated 11/16/01Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but=
 he's still too good to ever consider benching. The veteran has a knack for=

llen and the Giants' secondary on Monday night.   Randy Moss , WR MIN - Rus=
sell Updated 11/16/01 Moss is listed as probable for Monday's game against =
the N.Y. Giants due to an ankle injury. He's been underachieving this seaso=

on Brooks , QB NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against Sa=
n Francisco last weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be =
a bit inconsistent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers make=
s it tough to bench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defen=
se.    Willie Jackson!  , WR NO - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Jackson put up a =
huge game against San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 ya=
rds receiving. He'll face a questionable Indianapolis squad that is vulnera=
ble to the pass in Week 10, so starting Jackson this week is a solid option=
.   Stephen Davis , RB WAS - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Davis has stepped u=
p his play after beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushi=
ng over his last four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fanta=
sy player. Give him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is v=
ulnerable to high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated=
 11/16/01 Banks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his la=
st three games. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team =
that can be beaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very=
 deep Fantasy leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11=
/16/01 Westbrook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three=
 touchdown passes in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary thi=
s weekend that is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is =
! wo! rth considering.   Rod Gardner , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01=
 Gardner has been held in check in his last two games, catching only three =
passes for 38 yards. He does have a favorable matchup this weekend against =
Denver, however, so starting him is a good move.   Az-Zahir Hakim , WR STL =
- Neal/McKay Updated 11/16/01 Hakim has been inconsistent in recent weeks, =
so starting him on your Fantasy team is a gamble unless the matchup is righ=
t. He'll go up against a tough New England secondary in Week Ten, so avoid =
using him outside of de! ep! er leagues.   Torry Holt , WR STL - Tori Updat=
ed 11/16/01 Holt continues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's on=
ly scored only three touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England=
 secondary this weekend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team=
 based on his potential to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - F=
rank Updated 11/16/01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this seas=
on, but he's still one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB =
Ty Law and the formidable New England secondary, but he's still wo! rt! h s=
tarting based on his potential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL -=
 Matty Updated 11/16/01 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving tha=
t he is still the best Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start ever=
y week, and should post solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ern=
ie Conwell , TE STL - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few dow=
n weeks, so starting him on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With=
 the lack of depth at tight end around the league, however, starting Conwel=
l is something many Fantasy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard=
 Huntley , RB CAR - Russell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely sta=
rter this weekend against San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he split=
s carries with Nick Goings. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all=
 possible.   Donald Hayes , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes ha! d ! =
only two catches for 11 yards last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unr=
eliable for Fantasy owners this season, so starting him is a real gamble.  =
  Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held i=
n check over the last three weeks, but he's still one of the better tight e=
nds in the league. He's had some success against San Francisco in the past,=
 so starting him is advisable.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated =
11/16/01 Muhammad finally had a somewhat productive game, catching six pass=
es for 75 yards against St. Louis. He's had some success in the past agains=
t this week's opponent, San Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   =
Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best=
 Fantasy quarterbacks in the league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team=
 on Sunday with a very vulnerable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this=
 week.   Bubba Franks , TE GB - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not =
put up huge yardage numbers! , ! but his seven touchdowns in eight games ma=
kes him a valuable Fantasy player. Unless you have a better option on your =
roster, Franks is the type of tight end that should start on a weekly basis=
.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Frank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is n=
ot listed on the NFL injury report, and is expected to start on Sunday agai=
nst Atlanta. He's a solid play this week against Atlanta, whose secondary i=
s vulnerable to strong passing teams like Green Bay.   More Updates   Sched=

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Industrial Markets
EIM has recently formed a Forest Products Origination team led by Rob Saltiel to pursue structured transactions.  Typically, these deals employ a combination of physical supply/offtake, price risk management and/or finance to bring value to Enron and our customers.  Priority commodities include pulp, newsprint, recycled papers, linerboard, and lumber.  Response to the new team's efforts has been positive, as many of the Forest Products companies have needs for commodity and capital solutions that are currently unavailable.  

Enron Freight Markets
During its first month in the over-the-road (OTR) trucking business, Enron Freight Markets has completed over 120 spot OTR trades.  On Friday, March 18, there was a shortage in the Houston outbound market and capacity was selling for $1.65 per mile.  By comparison, average market price has stayed in the $1.05-$1.10 per mile range in recent weeks.

EnronOnline
On May 23, Enron Corp. announced that it completed its one-millionth transaction on EnronOnline, the world's largest web-based e-commerce platform for commodities. As an online extension of its successful wholesale energy business, EnronOnline began transacting natural gas and electricity on November 29, 1999.  Since that time, the company has extended the platform to approximately 1500 wholesale commodity products ranging from energy-related commodities to bandwidth, metals, forest products, plastics, petrochemicals, and weather and credit derivatives.

Approximately 60 percent of all Enron transactions are now conducted online, and the cost of processing the transactions has been reduced by 75 percent. 

EnronOnline Statistics

Below are the latest figures for EnronOnline as of May 23, 2001

?		Total Life to Date Transactions   > 1 million
?	Life to Date Notional Value of Transactions   > $600 billion
 

IN THE NEWS
Enron Corp. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Skilling likes to say that the nation's leading energy merchant was ready for the Internet long before there was anything.com. Enron's business of buying and selling commodities - by phone or fax - was a natural fit for the Web. The challenge now is to get the new broadband Internet trading unit on solid footing by proving that bandwidth can be traded like a commodity. BusinessWeek e.biz/May 14,2001.

PIRA's Emissions Marketing Intelligence Service (EMIS) just released its
latest report to clients entitled, "Update: The Southern California (NOx)
RECLAIM Market."  On May 11 the South Coast Air Quality Management District
Board removed power generators, as defined under the program, from the NOx
RECLAIM market at least until 2004. However, their actions to date have left
the rest of the RECLAIM participants, such as oil refineries, facing an
ongoing, extremely tight market balance.

A second, extensive report analyzing trends and prospects in the SO2 Credit
Market will be released shortly.

Non-EMIS clients interested in the latest RECLAIM report can purchase it for
$2,000. The annual fee for quarterly EMIS reports is $4,500 for up to 10
users at one client site (office).

For more information, please contact Victoria Watkins at (212) 686-6808,
ext. 315 or vwatkins@pira.com.

Hunter, 

A tour of the new Enron Building has been set up for
Thursday at 3:30 pm.

As you know the building is still under construction and can be dangerous
for anyone.

For safety reasons, Only 8 people can go on this tour.  This tour
is only for people that really need to go, the building is not open
for anybody to just "sight-see".

This is the best I could do.  Let me know if you need details.

Besides you and Laura, let me know what other 6 people will be
going to this tour, so I can submit the names to Clark.

Thanks,
Rain

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors.

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.   The deadline to register is Monday, May 21.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.

MEXICAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.
----------

GREAT BRITAIN
You have two cows.
The government shoots one cow because it has Mad Cow.
The government comes back and shoots the other one because it has foot
and mouth.
----------

EUROPEAN DEMOCRACY
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If there aren't any, they invent some.
They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing
cows.
----------

AMERICAN DEMOCRACY
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair "cowgate," but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.
----------

CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows.
You sell them and retire on the income.
----------

ENRON VENTURE CAPITALISM
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters
of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a
debt/ equity swap with an associated general offer so that you get all
four cows back, with a tax exemption for five cows.  The milk rights
of the six cows are transferred via an intermediary to a Cayman Island
company secretly owned by the majority shareholder who sells the
rights to all seven cows back to your listed company.  The annual
report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one more.

Laura -

What do you think about setting up Enron only trading books to utilize our Enron Var?  I know that our group still has YE targets to meet and these targets become impossible if we are prevented from trading.  I think it also sends a strong signal to PGL about ENA's belief in this business.  I would like nothing more than to make the money back and not share any with PGL given their recent actions.  Let me know what you think.  I sure everyone's first instinct is to lay low and not rock the boat, but I would hate to miss a big move in NG especially since I lost money on the way up.  This could take a few days to set up.

Richard

Hunter, 

I have been thinking through the combinations of Analysts and Associates and wanted to run this grouping by you:

Supply - Sachin Gandhi (Lead), Catalina Cardenas, Neeran Pathak
Consumption (including Power) - Virawan Yawaponsiri (Lead), Tara Piazze, Sabina Rank, Abhijeet Naik, Bart Burk
STP - Mat Smith (Lead), Biliana Pehlivanova, Denver Plachy, Justin O'Malley, Nate Blackburn, Lauren Schlesinger

Mat Smith has been filling in for Tori Kuykendall while she is on maternity leave, and is only available part time for the fundamentals group.  I put strong resources in the STP group (Biliana, Denver, and Lauren) in order to create some momentum there.  All three of the people in the lead positions will rotate out of the group within three months.  If I had to choose leads today for when the rotations occurred, I would put Justin over the STP group, Lauren over the Consumption group, and leave the supply lead vacant.  Let me know what you think.

Chris

Good Morning! 
Bottom line: No Changes - Overall US conditions will return to a more normal late fall/early winter pattern (no Arctic air) over the next 2 days. This pattern will persist through the end of the month. 
For the near term (1-5): Bottom Line - Cooler weather will bring temperatures below normal from the beginning through the middle of the week in the Midwest and from the middle through the end of the week in the East and South. The below normal event will last 3 to 4 days before normal temperatures return. The Rockies and West will be normal to above normal with cooling by the end of the week.
Details: We see some cool anomalies arriving into the Midwest tomorrow, with temperatures in Chicago reaching highs late tonight and the mercury falling through the day tomorrow. By Tuesday, the South and Texas will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low 40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight. Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely. Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation.
6-10 Day Bottom Line: Variable conditions continue with a stormy pattern entrenched over much of the nation. Overall temperatures will be normal to cool with very wet conditions. NO strong Arctic air is expected.
Details: A strong storm will push into the West late next week and next weekend bringing heavy rain and snow and temperatures near to below normal. At the same time - the Midwest will warm toward normal with wet conditions developing. By early in the last week of November the strong western storm will push into the central U.S. bringing widespread rain and snow. Behind the system another surge of below normal temperatures will track from the Midwest to the South to the East.
11-15 Day a generally cool and wet weather pattern will persist over much of the nation. While NO Arctic air is clear on the horizon - temperatures on a national average will be cooler than normal and there will be an increased threat for rain and snow. 
So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter. Here's the strip beginning with today:

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise

Attached is a file that has all of the Central Region EOL products.  EOL needs to reassign trader names and books to these products.  I realize that not all products will initially be active, but we are in the process of getting everything ready for the restart of trading business.  Just put a trader name in column H for the corresponding EOL product.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks.

DG

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your "native" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding "1" or a "2" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

Thank you,

Tom and Phillip,
 
Let me know what your thoughts are on the arrangement of the Southwest.  Lavo informed Scott last night that the ERCOT desk would not be located next to Gas.  
 
Scott and Hunter,
 
What are your thoughts on switching areas with each other.  It might be nice to have central next to Frankie Ermis and the rockies boys.  East would then be that much closer to Nymex.
 
Just a sketch.  Let me know what you think.
 
Grigsby

I want to make sure that we are adopting a policy whereby any material changes to employment agreements for individual employees are adopted across the board so we are creating consistency for all employees with respect to contract terms and conditions.
 
I think this is very important from an execution and timing standpoint.   I want to be able to represent to employees that "lawyering" the docs to death is not necessary, because we are going to maintain consistency for all employees.
 
I would like an affirmative yes on this question by Tuesday am.
 
Does everyone agree?

I have informed Zach McCarroll that he will not be offered a position with UBS.  Hunter and I have discussed my favorable opinion of Zach as an Analyst and the possibility that we may be able to offer him a position in the event we have employees decline the offer.  I would like to communicate with all of you over the weekend and on Tuesday to see if there will be a chance to offer him a position in Fundies.

Dear Colleagues,

We know you have many questions about your new benefits plan, payroll issues and other changes that will occur over the next few weeks. Human Resources and Communications are preparing a thorough Q&A, which we will send to you tomorrow and will regularly update as more information is available. 

Meanwhile, please read the announcement below from Security about how you can obtain a new UBS Warburg access card that will allow you to enter our new office space after Friday.

I am confident that you share my enthusiasm about our new opportunity.  We look forward to working along side each of you in the coming days.

David Oxley
Head, Human Resources
____________________________________________________________________

Access Cards

There will be a two-day transition for the new UBS Warburg access cards. Beginning Monday, February 11, access to the 5th and 6th floors of Enron Center South will require these new cards. UBS Warburg access cards can be picked up from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. at the reception area on the 5th floor of Enron Center South on Thursday, February 7th ; Friday, February 8th ; and Monday, February 11. Enron Security will produce new access cards with existing photographs, then simultaneously issue the new and collect the old cards. Employees without UBS Warburg cards will be allowed into the Enron Center South building on Monday but will have to collect their new cards as soon as possible to gain access to the 5th and 6th floors.

Employees who fail to collect their new cards by 7 p.m. Monday will be required to contact Enron Security's general information number at 713-853-5360 to arrange to pick them up.

There will be security staff available at the pick up point on ECS 5 to help with any problems you might have.

It is suggested employees wear their access cards at all times while on the premise.

Accessible Areas - The new cards will allow UBS-W employees to enter:
5th & 6th floors and Plaza area of Enron Center South , 
The Sky Ring 
Body Shop, Enron Center North Plaza and therefore access the Credit Union and Cafeteria from either building.

Restricted Areas - Employees must submit to Enron Security a Restricted Access Request form (available by calling 713 8535360 ) and signed by Bob McAuliffe (713-853-7468) to enter:
Enron Center South, 8th and 9th floors
Enron Center North, 22nd and 34th floor 
Ardmore Data Center.

Employees staying with the Enron estate while visa and other issues are completed - Employees in this group who are on assignment arrangements to UBS-W will be issued a regular access card - available in the same way as other new UBS-W employees.

Estate employees who are working with UBS-W on transition issues  - If they will be based in UBS-W office space they should talk to their UBS-W counterpart for approval and then UBSW HR for the issue of a UBS-W contractor card (in addition to their regular Enron badge).

Hello everyone.

In December we decided to kill our planned offsite due to market volatility.  Louise and I would like to get everyone together offsite, probably in late June (once Louise is back from holiday (just kidding)).  I think it's time to go have a little fun with the group driving Enron's success. 

I would like suggestions as to:

1)  Where to go.

2)  What should be the focus of the business meetings.

3)  Should we have business meetings or should we do something else (ie. climb a mountain)?  I'm not a strong bid on climbing a mountain. 

4)  And any other ideas you have.

In addition I would like to start having staff meetings about once a month.  The first one will be Friday May 11th at 2:30 p.m.  Please add this to your schedule.  I have invited everyone who has P/L responsibility.  Portland, Calgary and Toronto will have to be on Video or Phone conference.    

Regards

John

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

Attached are comments which ENA proposes to file in response to FERC's Notice of Proposed Rulemaking establishing the right for releasing shippers to recall released capacity from the replacement shipper for nomination at each of the first three GISB prescribed nomination deadlines.  The comments support the NOPR except that we say the FERC should make it absolutely clear that the intraday recall right must be part of a specific and express agreement between the releasing and replacement shipper, and that FERC should schedule a workshop after issuing the order so that operational concerns, such as accounting and gas tracking issues, can be worked out.

Comments must be filed by Monday, so please let me know if you have any concerns or suggestions by noon CST on Friday, 11/16.  Thanks.

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

Hunter,

Here is the list for Gas Fundamentals and a note about each person:

1. Dipak Agarwalla - essential to the group for modeling and statistics
2. Biliana Pehlivanova - would put her in charge of supply
3. Jozef Lieskovsky - would put him in charge of consumption
4. Adam Bayer - ops reports expertise/desk fundamentals
5. Vladi Pimenov - would put him in charge of desk fundamentals
6. Denver Plachy - hardest worker in fundamentals to date - would work on supply
7. Justin O'Malley - best resource on ops reports - he was in the group when they were built
8. Patrick Tucker - met with him briefly twice - would have him work with the supply/consumption teams
9. Brian Falik - best resource on economic research
10. Bart Burk - helped Dipak build the power stack models
11. Virawan Yawapongsiri - has not expressed interest in coming back to fundamentals
12. Jeremy Buss - limited exposure to fundamentals - I have trouble moving him up the list due my experience with the names above
13. Brent Dornier - introduced to him once - I have trouble moving him up the list due to my experience with the names above

Let me know if you wish to discuss.

Chris

Dear Colleague,

This note is to inform you that, effective January 3, 2002, PIRA Energy
Group will terminate delivery of the Energy Retainer Services, which we
have been providing Enron for almost a decade.  This action is based on
the instructions we received from your company last month. Your Online
password will be deactivated and your emails will cease.

We hope not only that you have found value and use from our comprehensive
fundamental analysis of oil, natural gas, and electricity markets, but that
you have enjoyed working with PIRA and its staff.  We have certainly
appreciated our close working relationship with Enron and we regret the
disruption. We certainly hope that we can restart a relationship with many
of you who will remain with Enron or move on elsewhere. Should it be the
case that you require continued delivery from, and Online access to, PIRA's
services, please respond to this email or contact Jeff Steele at
(212) 686-6808, or jsteele@pira.com.

To all of you, we wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors.

Regards,

A.J. Conley
Managing Director, Client Services
PIRA Energy Group

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.  After seeking opinions from various business people, the overwhelming conclusion was to work with the Estate prior to entering business school in the fall.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

Mike

Subject:	 Meeting this week-end


We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month

After much success last year with our AskWhy advertising campaign and Public Relations efforts, Enron continues to explore new ways to exponentially increase its' brand awareness not only through television, but also by exploring new mediums. One approach is through customer relationship marketing (CRM), where we will seek opportunities that allow our commercial teams to directly interact with important CXOs and existing customers. 

To this end, we are proud to announce our participation in the Frank Gehry Architect Exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City, which will be open to the public from May 18 through August 31.  Frank Gehry is a world-renowned architect who has designed the unique building at the end of our "Ode to Why" commercial and his art dominates skylines around the world. With this exhibition, Gehry's evolving genius comes to life.  For years, his inspiration has long been hidden in sketches and models unseen by anyone but his closest collaborators. By challenging the conventional, he has redefined his industry just as Enron has in business. Through Enron's association with this world-class exhibit, we will subtly push our brand attributes forward, as we strive to be the "Leading Company in the World."

All employees are invited to visit this exhibition FREE OF CHARGE with an Enron ID Badge beginning May 18. For more details, please visit home.enron.com.

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.

Can I get a list of the traders that will make up the new reporting list for the new company as we stand today?  We need to get new books set up, and also we need to get the V@R engine ready to go as well.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks, 
Tammy

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards, 
Tammy

Tried to call but couldn't reach you - I think we do need to discuss contracts for both of them and find the money for them.  
I am assuming from this that you are in - which is great news.

I will forward to Oxley to make him aware that there is something coming.

Hunter, it appears that we are being more and more exposed to the various products associated with EOL. My concern is that no one in my group really has a complete understand of many of the key concepts in this area, i.e.:

The difference between physical and financial products
Explanation of the concept of Basis Differential
The difference between term, cash, prompt, ROM etc.
How the Nymex products affect the above... i.e. auto hedge.
What are the downstream systems, i.e. Sitara for physical etc?
Why trade physical over financial
The various rules associated with each product ie cash only trades until 11ish and then becomes a new product for the next trade day.
How to calculate positions based on forward curves
etc.

As you can see from my points above, my knowledge in this area is really fragmented, and since the EOL products you trade are highly associated with or function on the floor, can I suggest that we arrange a weekly training session for my group, with someone from your team, i.e. Martin (he is been very helpful to date). But it important that its someone who understands that we have no real financial backgrounds.

 

My hope is that if we have a better understanding of how you work, we can:

 

?         Be more proactive in providing tools based on above principles

?         Speed up development (i.e. Pipeline economic sheet took far too long)

?         Help us architect better solutions for the plasmas in the future

 

Anyway, let me know your thoughts, I am unsure if any of the above knowledge is available outside of our domain, hence I have copied Steve Stock on this mail.

 

-Colin

Installation of Version 8 is Easy 
 
Version 8 will be available for download and installation on your system this evening, Thursday, November 15th. Live trading with Version 8 will begin on November 16th. We have already notified your System Administrators of this new release and provided them with download and installation instructions. 
 
Version 8 is backward compatible with version 7.37 and version 7.72.

Hunter,
FYI - Next Tuesday we will be getting together with Tom to talk about what we will need to be prepared for in a hurricane.  We are planning to talk about the different interconnects within our region as well as the east desk, plans to replace gas, what legal considers force majeure and rankings.  I have invited the schedulers from the east and upstream desks hoping that this will help facilitate discussion and ideas on how to resolve problems should a hurricane happen.   

Kirk Lenart is also in the process of working with Unify team to create reports out of Unify to enable us to track cuts in Unify rather than on a spreadsheet.  This will be more efficient and accurate.  The code freeze on Unify will soon be lifted since the migration to the new server will happen this weekend.

Let me know if you have any other suggestions or questions. 

Lisa

Subject:	enovate's DPR

Please note that enovate's general managers have informed Trading Risk
Management that the enovate DPR will reflect a short "net open position"
that will exceed the enovate Board's approved 10 BCF.  This situation will
arise due to the efforts of the trading group to unwind enovate's positions
by moving inventory of approximately 14 BCF out of the NGPL NSS account to
PGL.  This action will leave the "short" hedged positions held against these
NSS volumes in the EMW trading book without the physical offset, creating a
short net open position on the enovate DPR.  ENA has agreed to terminate the
"short" hedges under the "rights of termination" provided them under their
forward contracts. It has been agreed that the termination of these short
forward contracts will occur at the same time that title to the NSS
inventory is transferred. When that termination is completed, the short "net
open position" on the DPR will drop to near zero.  Since this is a temporary
situation which is being managed for the specific purpose of unwinding the
enovate positions, the enovate Board  is approving an exception to the 10
BCF limit only for this transaction to be consummated."

Hey Guys,
I probably will need one more spot.  We have been talking about moving Cora into a little different position so that she can handle the Peoples and Chicago office activity.  This means that I will need another scheduler to replace her.  Hunter/Laura do you want Cora with the traders or with the schedulers?  I have told Rain already and have put the spot with the schedulers.  Let me know if you need something different.
Lisa

/16/01 According to published reports, Weinke will be the starting quarterb=

6/01 Culpepper is one pace for a good Fantasy season despite the lack of co=
nsistency in Minnesota's offense this season. He's one of the better quarte=
rbacks in the league from a Fantasy perspective, and should be in your star=
ting lineup on a weekly basis.   Cris Carter , WR MIN - Tori Updated 11/16/=
01 Carter's numbers may be down somewhat this season, but he's still too go=

b! ers.   Ricky Williams , RB NO - Bass/Hull Updated 11/16/01 Williams is o=
ne of the better Fantasy backs in the league, and is a good player to use o=
n a weekly basis. He'll face an Indianapolis defense that has been underach=
ieving all season long, so Williams is a must-start.     Aaron Brooks , QB =
NO - Matty Updated 11/16/01 Brooks had a big game against San Francisco las=
t weekend, throwing for 347 yards and two scores. He may be a bit inconsist=
ent this season, but his potential to post huge numbers makes it tough to b=
ench him, especially against a vulnerable Indianapolis defense.    Willie J=

 San Francisco last weekend, posting 11 catches and 167 yards receiving. He=

ter beginning the season slowly. He's averaged 112 yards rushing over his l=
ast four games, and is once again emerging as a reliable Fantasy player. Gi=
ve him the start in Week 10 against a Denver defense that is vulnerable to =
high scoring games.   Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Ban=
ks has played well of late, throwing five touchdowns in his last three game=
s. He's got a good matchup this weekend against a Denver team that can be b=
eaten through the air, but he's only worth considering in very deep Fantasy=
 leagues.   Michael Westbrook , WR WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Westbr=
ook has been inconsistent this season, but he has caught three touchdown pa=
sses in his last four games. He'll face a Denver secondary this weekend tha=
t is vulnerable at best, so starting him in deeper leagues is worth conside=

ntinues to put up consistent yardage totals, but he's only scored only thre=
e touchdowns this season. He'll face a tough New England secondary this wee=
kend, but he's still worth starting on your Fantasy team based on his poten=
tial to put up solid numbers.   Isaac Bruce , WR STL - Frank Updated 11/16/=
01 Bruce hasn't put up the huge Fantasy totals this season, but he's still =
one of the better wideouts in the league. He'll face CB Ty Law and the form=
idable New England secondary, but he's still worth starting based on his po=
tential for big numbers.   Marshall Faulk , RB STL - Matty Updated 11/16/01=
 Faulk had a huge game against Carolina, proving that he is still the best =
Fantasy player in the league. He's a must-start every week, and should post=
 solid numbers in Week 10 against New England.   Ernie Conwell, TE STL - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Conwell has had a few down weeks, so starting him=
 on your Fantasy team is somewhat of a gamble. With the lack of depth at ti=

asy owners will have no choice but to do.   Richard Huntley , RB CAR - Russ=
ell Updated 11/16/01 Huntley will be the likely starter this weekend agains=
t San Francisco, but don't be surprised if he splits carries with Nick Goin=
gs. Avoid starting either back in Week 10 if at all possible.   Donald Haye=
s , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Hayes had only two catches for 11 yard=
s last weekend against St. Louis. He's been unreliable for Fantasy owners t=
his season, so starting him is a real gamble.    Wesley Walls , TE CAR - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/16/01 Walls has been held in check over the last three =
weeks, but he's still one of the better tight ends in the league. He's had =
some success against San Francisco in the past, so starting him is advisabl=
e.   Muhsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/16/01 Muhammad finally ha=
d a somewhat productive game, catching six passes for 75 yards against St. =
Louis. He's had some success in the past against this week's opponent, San =
Francisco, so starting him is a decent move.   Brett Favre , QB GB - Frank =
Updated 11/16/01 Favre has been one of the best Fantasy quarterbacks in the=
 league this season. He'll face an Atlanta team on Sunday with a very vulne=
rable secondary, so be sure to start Favre this week.   Bubba Franks , TE G=
B - Free Agent Updated 11/16/01 Franks may not put up huge yardage numbers,=
 but his seven touchdowns in eight games makes him a valuable Fantasy playe=
r. Unless you have a better option on your roster, Franks is the type of ti=
ght end that should start on a weekly basis.    Bill Schroeder , WR GB - Fr=
ank Updated 11/16/01 Schroeder (ankle) is not listed on the NFL injury repo=
rt, and is expected to start on Sunday against Atlanta. He's a solid play t=
his week against Atlanta, whose secondary is vulnerable to strong passing t=
eams like Green Bay.   Reuben Droughns , RB DET - Free Agent Updated 11/16/=
01 Droughns will likely split time with Lamont Warren in Detroit's backfiel=

Attached is the spreadsheet for the Houston Commercial Admins.  Those in white are slated to recieve offers first.  Those in red will only recieve offers if someone on the primary list declines.  Please make sure you and the other desk heads are comfortable with the list as it is.  I will be at the Houstonian today but Amy Fitzpatrick will be here and can assist you if you need to have a meeting to discuss.  Thanks.

On Wednesday we will be having a mini Trading Track interview session.  The quality may not resemble the first session we had but I thought it would be worth it if we can find a couple more folks to put in the program.  We will probably have a much bigger one later in the year after the new analysts and associates join.  I had a couple of observations from last time.

1.  I think we were too hard on external candidates.  There are 5 or 6 external candidates.  Remember that they don't have the Enron grounding that the internal candidates have.  Most of them are not in the Gas or Electricity industry.  Try to evaluate them on their intrinsic qualities.

2.  Some people have not thought about trading concepts and are unfamiliar with trading lingo.  That doesn't mean that they will not be good traders one day. I think we were a little biased based on someones ability to run a stack tommorrow.  

Regards

John

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

Louise

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side	
+	Customers		Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10)
				Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50)
				Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100)
+	Action Plan		Phase  1 Customers
				Phase  2 Customers
				Phase  3 Customers
+	Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc)
+	Customer visit schedule

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

Hunter,

Can we utilize the equipment (monitors and computers) from the other floors that are not in use.  I was thinking that we could expand the analysts desks to 3-4 monitors and use some of the excess computers as report generation machines if the equipment has already been purchased.  Let me know what you think.

Chris

Hunter, can you check the following sheet you ensure the 'change' values are correct. 

Also, when a product is deactivated, how would you like it represented on the sheet ? i.e. removed completely, flagged as 'deactivated' and N/A in the bid/offer/change fields etc ?

Hunter,

I checked with Neeran and Sachin, and the demand destruction numbers that we used in the presentation were PIRA's and not our internal numbers, so I feel better about that.  I will make sure that you see a copy of the presentation before it is sent out next time.

Chris

The NRB ruling has not come down yet BUT the Union President has received a phone call from the National Labor Relations Board (NRB) and they will be ruling in favor of the Union, forcing Midwest to the negotiation table.
Midwest has been notified of this and are attempting to call for a special meeting with the NRB to be released from the negotiations.
At that time, the NRB is prepared to have a judge require that Midwest to come to the table.
If Midwest comes to the table but is not willing to negotiate, Labor 15 will proceed with a strike.  At this time, it is estimated the strike will take a week to implement after a strike decision is made.  This is due to the newly formed Labor 15 and its disorganization.

NEW FEATURES
from The Wall Street Journal


Dear Subscriber:

If your New Year's resolution is to advance your career and boost the size
of your paycheck, then look no further than CareerJournal, The Wall Street
Journal's career site for executives, managers and professionals. We've
added extensive compensation data, plus several other convenient features,
as we continue in our quest to make CareerJournal the Web's most useful
and focused site for professionals like you.

Our new features include:

--Improved Salary Data--
We've added a huge free database of compensation tables for thousands of
job titles throughout the U.S., Canada and more than 200 countries around
the globe. To access this new data, simply click on the Salary & Hiring
link below, then click on your industry or function in the menu. The data
are being provided by the Economic Research Institute (ERI), a top
compensation and benefits research firm, and complements the hundreds of
salary tables we've always featured on the site, as well as the in-depth
articles we publish each week on hiring demand by function and industry.
http://www.careerjournal.com/salaries/index.html

--Special Reports: Diversity and Academia--
Minority candidates, as well as those seeking careers in academia, face
special challenges in the job market. In our reports, we offer specific
guidance on unique recruitment issues. Our Diversity special report
focuses on such issues as why hiring of minority candidates has stayed
strong during the recession, and why a company's track record in promoting
diverse employees is critical when attracting new hires.
http://www.careerjournal.com/specialreports/diversity/

Our report on academic career issues includes articles on why corporate
executives without academic experience are in demand among many learning
institutions, and on the expanding role of professional fund-raisers among
eductaional employers.
http://www.careerjournal.com/specialreports/academic/

--Executive Education Center--
If you're considering an executive education program, our new center
offers background information on hundreds of business programs offered
globally. Program descriptions include quick summaries, in-depth outlines,
locations, times, prices and registration information. The center only
features business schools that have been ranked or recognized by major
publications and/or professional organizations.
http://cj.ce.com/index.html

--Global Who's News Database--
Our database of executive changes has exceeded more than 3,000 executive

Our Lead Feature this week: ARE WE GETTING CLOSER TO A NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY?

In his Message, the Publisher discusses what may be the next scandal to emerge.....manipulation of prices in the natural gas sector......

"Will There be Another Gasoline Supply Crunch?".....where we look at the upcoming Spring transition period and the inevitable shortages that develop. ..

What's the Future Threat to Gasoline? Will it be Fuel Cells or Natural Gas Vehicles?

Inside the Enron Anderson Scandal, "How Did We Get Here?," examines the collapsing empire and asks who will be held accountable.

Of course we have our weekly crude oil and products market reports and price diaries, a complete supply section, our very popular refining segment, plus much more to round out the most comprehensive market intelligence tool in the petroleum industry. And best of all?..it's FREE?.along with our WEEKLY PADD Reports (PADDs 1-5 plus Canadian terminals). Our competition asks anywhere from $975 to $2,800 per year weekly publications! Find out why we are the fastest growing publication in the industry today!

I think this guy should be independent from the fundies.   There may be special projects that are "highly confidential" in nature that should be directed by you, Hunter, Tim and myself.   I think Robert would be more successful in a freelance role.

Other input?

Hi John- thanks for the generous offer which I have accepted.  A couple of outstanding questions- 

1. Who am I reporting to?  I would welcome the opportunity to report to you or Greg.  I think my job was a lot easier in the past because our group had the backing of the Office of the Chair. This gave us credibility, independence, and the chance to contribute to strategic issues as well as the tactical issues of interest to the traders. However, I am obviously open to any reporting relationship you might suggest and I understand that my day-to-day duties will consist largely of interaction with the Fundy teams.

2. Are there any slots that have opened because of offers that were not accepted?  I would love to be able to take one of the folks from my group with me, particularly Kristin Walsh or my assistant Sharon Purswell.

Thanks again for the great offer and the chance to join UBS.

Robert

in controversies of the day are. Hopefully, these issues will spark a few i=

Good Morning!

Bottom line: No Changes.

For the near term (1-5), we see some cool anomalies arriving into the Dakotas by Monday already, with highs in the Dakotas in the mid-30s and lows in the mid-teens.By Tuesday, Texas and the Midwest will be in the below normal category, with Dallas overnights in the mid-30s (normal low 43), Houston's low in the mid-40s (normal upper-40s) and Chicago will freeze, with a mid-20 overnight.  Progressing into the Northeast by wednesday, Philly and New York will get into the below normal category, but 5 or 6 degree anomalies are most likely.  Looks like a three day event as it moves easterly and then is followed by moderation into the...

6-10 Day time period, which will see a cool shot over the Midwest/East towards next weekend, moderating again by early the following week. Then, early in the...

11-15 Day time period, more cool air moves in, beginning with central cooling, then even into the Southeast.

So, with normals dropping across the nation, this first cool air anomaly event arriving in the Midwest by Tuesday will elevate the nation's gas demand requirements into the 60 Bcf/d plus regime from here on through the winter.  Here's the strip beginning with today:

Sat 	11/17	47 Bcfd
Sun	11/18	52 Bcfd 
Mon	11/19	55 Bcfd
Tue	11/20	67 Bcfd
Wed	11/21	69 Bcfd
Thu	11/22	65 Bcfd
Fri	11/23	65 Bcfd
Sat	11/24	63 Bcfd
Sun	11/25	63 Bcfd
Mon	11/26	65 Bcfd
Tue	11/27	65 Bcfd

Till tomorrow,

A few more important reminders...

Chairs:  Must be labeled for the move---use the wire tags included in your move packets.
Keyboards, mice:  ONLY label non-standard types (i.e. wireless mice/keyboards, special ergonomic keyboards); otherwise, do not label.
Phones:  Do not label these.  New phones will be at your workstations at Enron Center South.
Laptops, cell phones, palm pilots, etc.:  Be sure to remind your groups to take these home.  The move team will not be responsible for moving these over.  However, docking station, cradles, etc. should be labeled.  The move team will move these over and set them up for you.

Thanks again for all your hard work,
Christa

Subject:	Move Related Issues

As you all know, our move is scheduled for this weekend.  Hopefully,  you and your groups are all progressing well in your preparations for the move this Friday. Please take the time to read the information contained in this message because most of the information contains reminders or FYI items and will be important to you and your group.  Please forward this to those in your group that may need this information.  

?	Voicemail instructions - Please have everyone in your group clear all new voicemail messages by 5:00 PM, Friday, 11/16.  All saved messages, greetings and recorded names will be saved.  If a message is left before cutover the message will be saved, but the message light will not be displayed when you arrive.  As a precautionary meassure please check voice mail upon your arrival Monday morning even if the message light isn't on.  

?	Building access - ECS will not be available for general access until Monday morning at 5:00 AM.  Due to the gas and power moves being combined, it is unlikely that the move team will be prepared for the POC's to come in on Sunday to unpack.  (Separate instructions will be generated for those who are needed to test trading applications.)  NOTE: Only those whose names have been approved and submitted to security will be allowed access on Sunday.
o	Monday - 5:00 AM for all employees

?	Security & badges -  All POC team members should be familiar with the routes into ECS as we discussed at our recent move meeting.  Please be sure to share this information with all of the people in your group.  If you need additional copies of the floor plans that have the access routes highlighted, please contact Carli Smith (5-3473). Please stress to everyone to have their badges with them at all times.  No one will be allowed access without their badge.  If anyone tries to access the building from the garage via the skyring and they do not have their badge, they will be sent back through the garage to the street level to walk across the street to the round kiosk in the Enron building lobby to get a guest pass and then proceed back to ECS via the 2nd floor and the skyring.

?	Move team colors - As mentioned at the move meeting, the following is a list of the color designations (vests) for the various teams that will be on the floor when we move in.  
o	Red - Move Team
o	Orange - Desktop Support/IT
o	Green - Telephony

?	Newspaper subscriptions - The delivery location for all newspaper subscriptions need to be changed to ECS 05/06.  It is our intention to have all daily newspapers delivered to the mail desk located in the ECS 2nd floor corridor.  It will be the responsibility of the assistants to either pick up the papers for their group or designate someone in their group to pick up the papers.  If your papers continue to be delivered to your old floor of ECN, contact Sunny Rodgers (3-6116).

?	Move boxes -  Please encourage your group to pack and bring no more than about 6 boxes per person.  You may call Facilities (3-6300) if you need to request additional boxes.

?	Move labels -  If you run out of labels or if you are missing any labels, please call Carli Smith (5-3473) to have additional or missing labels printed.

?	Laptops - Important - Please ensure that all cable locks have been removed from all laptop computers by 5:00 PM on Friday.  If any cable locks are left on the computers they will be destroyed by the move team in order to move the computers as scheduled.

.	Bottled water - Every kitchen has an ice machine that also dispenses filtered water.  The large bottles of water (5 gallon) will not be allowed on the floor.  We would also like   to discourage the use of small bottles of water due to limited storage space and the availability of filtered water at several locations.  

?	Phone sets - Although most of you are aware of this, we just wanted to remind you that there will be only one phone on each desk - either a turret or an Avaya, but not both.  Do not tag your phones, a new phone will be waiting for each person on their desk in the new building

I hope I have covered some of the outstanding questions or issues you might have, but if I have missed something, please let me know.  Thanks so much for all your help and hard work.

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking abou=
t over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest an=
d the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next =
weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet a=
nother trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) w=
ith the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Mi=
dwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to muc=
h above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for m=
ost of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast=
 mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest. =20

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm tod=
ay.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/=
   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "e=
nron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the d=
ay tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm=
 the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlik=
ely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer=
 picture for the East.* =20

=20
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team    =20

Martin Cuilla has kindly agreed to offer his time to help us understand some of the key concepts as trading Natural Gas. Therefore, starting sometime next week, we will be arranging a weekly Q/A. 

Please forward me any questions/topics you wish to discuss, so we can organize an itinerary, i.e.:

What products do we trade?
How do you manage risk ?
What does this floor trade on a daily basis?
Overview his job function?
How is P/L calculated throughout/end of day?
The difference between physical and financial products?
The difference between Nymex, Basis, Cash, Prompt Physical, Prompt Financial, Term, ROM etc?
Explanation of the concept of Basis Differential?
How do transportation costs affect Basis calculations?
How the Nymex products affect the above... i.e. auto hedge?
What are the downstream systems, i.e. Sitara for physical etc? 

-Colin

All,

The attached spreadsheet outlines the rotations for the internal new hires to the Trading Track.    I will be meeting with the new TT A&A tomorrow, and subject to them signing all associated documentation, they will join the Track immediately.

Let me know if you have any questions with respect to the rotations outlined and we can make the appropriate changes as we move forward.

Thanks,


Karen B.

All of the data capture jobs for collecting operational data for the west, central, and east desks failed last evening.  Colin is working to identify the problem, recapture the data, and run the morning reports.  I will update you as soon as I have any additional information.

We saw a larger credit spread in the market between EOL and ICE.  EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal - We ended up short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.

Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.

No new counterparty issues.

==New Organization==
We've reorganized the site to better meet your needs, with all-new main
sections and additions such as News by Industry. You'll also find more
related links on article pages, improved site navigation and pages that
surface more information yet require less scrolling.

==More Personalization==

This new edition of the Online Journal is the result of months of
in-depth interviews with our subscribers and exhaustive research and
testing, as well as comments from subscribers over the past six years.
I believe you'll find the Online Journal truly comes of age with the
introduction of these new benefits. I hope you'll take a moment to

you need to start pushing back.
 
This is a great opportunity that a million kids would love.  I think going up any more on his contract is insane.
 
Just my humble opinion.

, Player Updates  [IMAGE]Latest NFL Player News  Tony Martin , WR ATL - Fre=
e Agent Updated 11/21/01 Martin hasn't been a reliable Fantasy player at al=
l this season, but he could have a decent outing against Carolina. The Pant=
hers secondary is one of the worst in the league, so starting Martin in dee=
per Fantasy leagues may be worth considering.   Frank Sanders , WR ARI - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Sanders is dealing with two tight hamstrings, but=
 he's expected to play on Sunday against San Diego. The Chargers' secondary=
 h! as! n't been playing well of late, so giving Sanders some consideration=
 in deeper leagues is advisable.   David Boston , WR ARI - Bass/Hull Update=
d 11/21/01 Boston has become one of the premier wide receivers in Fantasy F=
ootball. He's posted three touchdowns and 217 yards receiving in his last t=
wo games, and should have another solid game vs. San Diego in Week 11.   To=
m Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Patriots Head Coach Bill Belichic=
k announced late Monday that Brady will remain the starting quarterback for=
 the remainder of the season, barring injury. This relegates Drew Bledsoe t=
o a backup role and makes him useless from a Fantasy perspective. Brady mig=
ht have his hands full passing against the Saints on Sunday, but he is a fa=
irly safe weekly starter otherwise.   Dolphins , DT MIA - Martin Updated 11=
/21/01 Defensive tackle Daryl Gardener could miss the remainder of the seas=
on due to a fragmented disc in his back. He will miss at least one month to=
 rest and rehabilitate the injury before being re-evaluated. Gardener's abs=
ence hurts the Dolphins' rush defense, which might be burned a little more =
by opposing running backs in the upcoming weeks. Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Fr=
ee Agent Updated 11/21/01 Minnis is unlikely to be available for Sunday's g=
ame against Seattle due to the sprained ankle he suffered during a Nov. 11 =
game against the Jets. He will be replaced by Chris Thomas in the lineup at=
 split end, and you should keep him reserved for this week.  Mark Brunell ,=
 QB JAC - JWillie Updated 11/21/01 Brunell's nagging leg injury might sidel=
ine him for Sunday's game against Baltimore. He decided about two hours bef=
ore last Sunday's kickoff that he couldn't play against Pittsburgh due to a=
 strained right quadriceps. Jonathan Quinn has been preparing as if he will=
 start the game, so right now you shouldn't count on Brunell this week as y=
ou set your lineups.  Fred Taylor , RB JAC - Martin Updated 11/21/01 Taylor=
 received a second medical opinion Tuesday that indicated his severe groin =
injury could keep him out up to three months and possibly the remainder of =
the season, according to the Florida Times-Union. The diagnosis was that th=
e injury still has not healed and will need more time to become healthy, an=
d in the meantime Taylor has developed pain ! in! his hip, a side effect of=
 the injury. It's sounding more and more like Taylor will not play again th=
is Fantasy season, although you should probably hold onto him until a final=
 decision is reached, provided you have a deep enough bench.  Rod Smith , W=
R DEN - Matty Updated 11/21/01 Smith's sprained ankle was not healed enough=
 for him to practice on Tuesday, and there is a real chance he might miss T=
hursday's game against Dallas. He suffered the injury Nov. 11, and aggravat=
ed it during Sunday's game. You should probably play it safe and keep Smith=
 on your bench for this week. Temper your expectations for the entire Bronc=
os' offense as well - the Cowboys' D isn't the pushover many believed it wo=
uld be prior to the season.  Shaun Alexander , RB SEA - JWillie Updated 11/=
20/01 With Ricky Watters expected to miss another two to three weeks, Alexa=
nder will remain the focal point of many contending Fantasy teams during th=
eir charge to the playoffs. He should roll up some fine numbers against the=
 Chiefs this week.  Tom Brady , QB NE - Martin Updated 11/20/01 The Patriot=
s will stick with Brady for now, and Drew Bledsoe will remain the team's No=
. 2 QB. "I don't see any changes this week," coach Bill Belichick said. Bra=
dy is a solid Fantasy starter right now, but add Bledsoe to your ! ro! ster=
 as an insurance policy if you can.  Jonathan Quinn , QB JAC - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/20/01 Quinn may have to start in place of Mark Brunell (quadricep=
s) again this week. Brunell's status is still unclear for Sunday's game.  R=
icky Watters , RB SEA - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Watters' shoulder has n=
ot sufficiently healed enough for him to practice, says the Seattle Times .=
 He is not expected to return for another two to three weeks, meaning Shaun=
 Alexander will continue to be a key performer for many Fantasy teams as th=
e postseason comes into view.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11/20/=
01 Mike Riley told the San Diego Union-Tribune there is no QB controversy i=
nvolving Flutie and rookie Drew Brees. "Doug is going to be our quarterback=
," he said. "You can talk about controversy all you want, but there is none=
 within this building. He is our quarterback. He will start. He will get us=
 the next win the next week." Still, Flutie is not playing well enought to =
satisfy most Fantasy owners.  Mark Bruener , TE PIT - Free Agent Updated 11=
/20/01 Bruener will miss the rest of the season after undergoing shoulder i=
njury. His loss may adversely affect Jerome Bettis' statistics, because Bru=
ener is widely regarded as the best run-blocking tight end in football.  Ty=
rone Wheatley , RB OAK - Giggles Updated 11/20/01 Wheatley told the Contra-=
Costa Times he is no longer being bothered by a knee injury. He expects to =
play on Sunday.  Erron Kinney , TE TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01Kinney =
(calf) may play this week after missing three games. He was expected to ret=
urn to practice early this week.  Frank Wycheck , TE TEN - Matty Updated 11=
/20/01 Wycheck (calf) will be limited in practice this week. He may be a ri=
sky start in Week 11.  Steve McNair , QB TEN - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 =
The Tennessean says McNair's hand was sore when he arrived at the team's pr=
actice facility on Monday. Jeff Fisher now says he doesn't expect him to mi=
ss any practice time this week.   Derrick Alexander , WR KC - JWillie Updat=
ed 11/20/01 Alexander (ribs) has returned to practice. He is expected to st=
art against Seattle.  Marvin Minnis , WR KC - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 M=
innis (ankle) is listed as doubtful for Sunday's game. Larry Parker may hav=
e to start in his place,  Reggie Wayne , WR IND - Free Agent Updated 11/20/=
01 Wayne has a sprained knee ligament, and is doubtful for Sunday's game ag=
ainst New Orleans. Terrence Wilkins may have to start in his place.  Jerome=
 Pathon , WR IND - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Pathon (foot) is done for the seas=
on. He will be put on injured reserve. Reggie Wayne (knee) is also hurting,=
 meaning Terrence Wilkins might have to be moved back into the starting lin=
eup.   Jay Fiedler , QB MIA - Tori Updated 11/20/01 Dave Wannstedt told the=
 Miami Herald there is no QB controversy surrounding Fielder and backup Ray=
 right now. ``! Th! at's kind of hypothetical,'' he said. ``Jay is the star=
ter, and my only comment is we're going to get it squared away and play tur=
nover-free football.''  Rod Smith , WR DEN - Matty Updated 11/20/01 Mike Sh=
anahan said he does not know if Smith (ankle) will be sufficiently healed t=
o play in Thursday's game against the Cowboys. "We'll get a chance to evalu=
ate that during the week and see," Shanahan told the Denver Post. "If he ca=
n help our football team, he'll play. If he's in a situation where he can't=
 perform at the level that we think can help our team, then we'll keep him =
out and put somebody else in."   Benjamin Gay  , RB CLE - Free Agent Update=
d 11/20/01 The Cleveland Plain-Dealer says Butch Davis won't indicate how m=
uch Gay will play in the near future. "We'll try to get him involved in som=
e of the games," Davis said. "We'll see."   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free A=
gent Updated 11/20/01 Lockett, who suffered a rib injury last weekend again=
st Denver, expects to play on Sunday against Philadelphia. However, the wid=
e receiver has no real value as a Fantasy player at this point.   Tony Bank=
s , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/20/01 Barring any setbacks, Banks will s=
tart Sunday's game against Philadelphia. Banks, who suffered a concussion l=
ast weekend vs. Denver, hasn't been feeling any after effects of the injury=
 and should be under center for the 'Skins.   Jacquez Green , WR TB - Free =
Agent Updated 11/20/01 Green (abdomen) is expected to return to practice on=
 Wednesday at full strength. He's been inconsistent this season, and is bes=
t used when the matchup is favorable.   Terrell Owens , WR SF - Martin Upda=
ted 11/20/01  Owens suffered a sprained left knee and ankle during the over=
time session of last weekend's game against Carolina. The injuries aren't c=
onsidered serious, however, and Owens is expected to be in the starting lin=

During the course of their investigation, Special Agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation will be taking documents they believe may be important for their investigation from employees' offices.  The FBI has agreed to return copies of such documents. 

In addition, should you have an immediate need for a document requested by the FBI, please make a copy of the specific document and give the original to the FBI. Thank you for your cooperation.

Chris/Hunter,

	I just wanted to make you aware of EGM's intent to possibly separate their website from the fundamentals structure.  The impact of this would be that EGM content would no longer be available within the Commodity Fundamentals website.  I personally do not feel that this is the best decision for the business ENA&EGM, it would limit the current vehicle in which content is delivered.  I also believe that considering the current state of Enron this is not the time to duplicate cost & effort because of ownership concerns.  I've voiced these concerns to Randal Frisbie and just wanted to make you aware of the possible loss of content.

Thanks,

David Dronet

David,

We are planning to separate the database and COM+ components that are shared by both groups. We would like the flexabiliy to make changes to the database structure and COM+ component functionality to improve the overall capability of the EGM Fundamentals web site without having to go through any approval process of the Gas Fundamentals group. 

We are currently looking at the pros and cons of this sepatation and will keep you informed as we move forward.

We would like the source code for both COM+ components that are used by both groups so that we can leveral off of existing code.

Thanks,

Randal

Laura,
Vlady has requested that I take over the CRO function for Enovate.  I'm thinking about traveling to Chicago next week to review related market risk issues, and get a feel for any other risk issues.  Additionally, what do you think about getting together with some of the People's people?    Any other suggestions or ideas to add/take off my agenda?

Frank

Hi Everyone...

1)  The forecast pattern seems very similar to what we've been talking about over the past several days.  6-10 features below normal in the Midwest and the East with a brief normalization possible toward the Great Lakes next weekend (days 8 and 9) before more cool air arrives.  11-15 indicates yet another trough digging into the East (temperatures normal to below normal) with the primary ridge remaining in the Southwest (above to much above).

2) 1-5 Day forecast also looks similar still quite cool for the East and Midwest - though not quite as hot for the immediate West Coast.  Above to much above normal temperatures will be common across interior California for most of the week with a 1 to 2 day spike of warm temperatures near the coast mid-week.  No prolonged period of heat will affect the Northwest.  

3) EarthSat will issue an "official" 6-10 and 11-15 forecast around 2pm today.  You can get this map by going to:  http://www.earthsat.com/misc/enron/   and then follow the "Sunday Update" link (near the bottom).  Login is "enron", Password is "enron".

Maps are attached - this is the way we feel things will look to start the day tomorrow.  *If there are any changes to this picture - it may be to warm the Midwest/ East closer to normal.  Right now this solution appears unlikely - but if there are any surprises tomorrow - it may be a SLIGHTLY warmer picture for the East.*  

 
Enjoy the rest of your weekend...
Research Weather Team

Please note that new factors will be put into production this evening.  Value-at-risk will most likely increase by the percentage outlined below.  Shorts are driving price risk, while long basis drives the forward physical risk.   




Let me know if you need access to component VAR analysis, so that you can effectively manage VAR.

  In the discussion to choose my reviewers for the PEP this year I was told to include individuals on the business side.  I chose you and Chris Gaskill as the primary business reviewers because of my work on Jaguar and the Weather Server (as well as general support of the floor) during the first four months of this year.  If you have any reservations or concerns or are just not interested in doing my review in addition to all the necessary reviews I understand completely, please just let me know.  If you have any questions for me please call me or email me.

Thanks

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

FYI
This is going down.  Thinking is if VAR goes ballistic they'll know Saturday and reverse before Monday.  There are risks involved in trying this over the weekend but Scott is committed to making sure there are no hitches.

Nilay,

OK its a go. I have changed the Vol Group CD in the Publication Name database from Omicron 10 to Omicron 1 for IF-ANR/LA. Hunter's VaR is half his limit and there should be more than enough cushn' to account for any increase in VaR this change may cause. Could you ensure it comes across in the GERMS side. If it does not because of an ERMS issue, could you contact Jeremy Wong? I think you could better describe any issues to him than I could. Thanks.

Scott

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

eSource
eSource, Enron's research group, has experienced an overwhelmingly positive response to the research training which it has hosted.  Participation and interest by Enron employees has exceeded expectations and many classes were quickly filled.  As a result, repeat classes have been offered and new sessions have been added to the program.  In addition to the Lexis-Nexis and Dow Jones classes, eSource has now begun hosting sessions on Piranha (financials and pricing information), Investext (analyst reports and market analysis), Global Access (financials and corporate activity), and Securities Data Corp. (M&A, debt).   eSource has also arranged long distance sessions using interactive web tools for Enron employees around the world.  Watch for e-mails announcing new training sessions, either in Houston or in a virtual desktop mode.

Since our launch in December, the eSearch website has received over 230,000 hits.  The site today offers Enron employees access to 34 electronic databases.  These databases offer the latest financial and business on-line research capabilities in a cost-effective manner.  In this era of information explosion, databases are constantly being reviewed to ensure that Enron's research needs are being met.  If you know of a professionally relevant database that might be added to eSearch, let us know.  Meanwhile, to further fulfill Enron's research needs, eSource is arranging for desktop access to good-old-fashioned libraries too.  Books from public and local university libraries can be located, borrowed and delivered to employees' desks.  This should be particularly helpful for those with more specialized or technical research needs. 

We are also proud to report that at a recent local research conference, Enron's eSource was featured as an industry trailblazer for having invented itself into a combined virtual library and intranet-based research center capable of delivering a broad range of research products and services via the user's desktop.  Attendees from Reliant, Shell, Halliburton and ExxonMobil and others were duly impressed.  

As for the future, watch for Version 2.0 of the eSearch website, http://esource.enron.com, scheduled to launch soon.  It will feature greater functionality and additional content.  Look for new features like "Industry Overviews" and links to information providers like Frost & Sullivan, Country Watch, and World Energy Markets.


IN THE NEWS

Chicago And Its Suburbs Pick Enron, ComEd For Power Deals
06/06/2001  Dow Jones Energy Service (Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)-The City of Chicago and 47 suburban communities have decided to divide new deals for 400 megawatts of power between Enron Corp. (ENE) and local utility Commonwealth Edison Co., Chicago officials said Wednesday. 
In the largest power purchase agreement in Illinois since the state choose to deregulate the industry in 1997, the local government groups will get 60% of their power from Enron and 40% from Exelon Corp.'s (EXC) ComEd. The municipalities use the power for public buildings and public transportation.
Chicago announced Monday that the group has picked ComEd to meet the renewable target by providing 80 megawatts of power created with landfill gas, wind and other sources. ComEd will also provide the coalition with another 80 megawatts of power generated with fossil fuel and nuclear plants, and Enron will provide the other 240 megawatts. The new contracts are expected to go into effect this year. 
"We used our purchasing power as local governments to get the best price we could and at the same time to promote competition in Illinois. Enron gave us the most competitive price,"  Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley said at a press conference.

Hunterbob and Fletch,
 
While I was walking today, people were running and walking in their shorts - my Dad's heat is not on.
 
Happy Belated Thanksgiving!

With Ken Lay's resignation, you undoubtedly have questions about Enron's management structure and what lies ahead for the company.  The purpose of this communication is to begin to answer those questions and lay out the direction we plan to follow as we regroup and rebuild.

First, the Creditors Committee has proposed that the Board of Directors retain an interim CEO to focus on the restructuring process.  This is a positive sign that the Committee believes Enron will provide greater value as a viable ongoing business.

The Enron Board of Directors has approved Stephen Cooper as interim CEO and chief restructuring officer.  Steve is the managing partner of Zolfo Cooper, a corporate recovery and crisis management firm with more than 30 years experience leading companies through operational and financial reorganizations.

Steve and his firm will work with members of Enron's current management to develop and implement a comprehensive plan to restructure the company and emerge from bankruptcy.  

As you know, Enron has entered into an agreement with UBS Warburg for the sale of NetCo, Enron's wholesale gas and power trading organization.  In preparation for the transition of NetCo to UBS, Greg Whalley has resigned as president and COO of Enron to assume a position with UBS Warburg.  We want to thank Greg and the NetCo employees joining UBS for their contributions to Enron and wish them great success going forward.

In addition to engaging Steve, Enron has formed an Office of the Chief Executive.  I will join Steve in that office as president and chief operating officer, and Ray Bowen will join us as executive vice president and chief financial officer.

We will provide additional information regarding the roles and responsibilities of Enron's entire management team once those become more fully defined.

Thank you for continuing to support Enron by performing your job everyday.  The ongoing uncertainty about our future, coupled with the constant media scrutiny, makes this situation difficult for all of us. While no one can control the media, we can and will define our leadership and devise our strategy for moving ahead.  And in doing so, we will build a more certain future for our company and our employees.

This is not a circular and you will not get another chance.  This deals with migration to new systems and you need to migrate your own information or applications in the next day.  Remember do not delete anything and data to be transferred must comply (see attachments below).

The policy must be complied by Thursday.  Please ensure that everyone in your group has moved everything which is in compliance with the policy.  We will not be delaying close or restart for people not having completed their own migrations.

Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply (eg Dana - please cover Kevin's migration requirements)

Thanks

Louise

ECS to ECN Network Interconnection, June 9th 2001

This is a notification that the Enron Corp. I/T Networks team will be connecting the new building network infrastructure located in Enron Center South (ECS) to the existing Enron Center North (ECN) backbone network.  While this activity is not expected to produce a disruption to network services, this notice is designed to alert the organization to our activities.  No network hardware or systems are anticipated to be shutdown.  The actual physical interconnection of the networks will be performed in the EB 34th floor Data Center.

Interconnection activities are scheduled to occur the evening of June 9th 2001 starting from 7:00 p.m.(CT) and completing around 11:00 p.m. (CT). Application testing activities will begin at 11:00 p.m. (CT) once all network testing has completed.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Year to date for PEC, October 1, 2000 thru present, Peoples has realized $10.5 MM specific to enovate.  

Thanx,
Laura

I do not understand the Netco/Newco comments.
 
Clearly at this point Enron the estate should maintain the space until it is sold to a new buyer.  That would be a Don Miller/Fallon final call - but I think its a no brainer.

Under commitments to PEC, Enron has commited to provide office, computers, trading systems, etc.  If this is changing, I need to know quickly.  I have been provided indications from several outside counterparties, some divisions within Newco and I thought Netco as holding interest in purchasing the Chicago business.  Due to the obvious indication of value for the joint venture with PEC, I believe it imperative that the business/office be operational until March, 2002, at a minimum.
 
Please advise.

Laura, 
I understand that the Metals group has asked to keep the Chicago office open until Mar 31 to wind things down.  Do you have any new information on ENA's Chicago folks at this time?  We may ask for a 60 day extension under bankruptcy orders to terminate the lease.  

Thanks, 
Tammy

OK 

Please check with Don Miller too.  Netco does not want San Francisco going forward and probably not Chicago.

We have asked EPSC to pay the following leases for the month of January based on feedback from ENA commercial leadership.  My understanding is that we may still reject these leases under the bankruptcy if we do so by Feb 2.  I will revisit the status of these leases with you before February rents are to be paid.  

Calgary 
Portland 
San Francisco 
Chicago 
Denver 

I have also been contacted by Paula Corey,  who is working on the enterprise strategy for the retrieval and disposition of remote office contents in the event any of these offices are closed.  I will keep you posted on the recommendations.

Regards, 
Tammy

	We have to unfortunately discontinue our live weather webpage from the website.  The feed we were receiving from Clayton Vernon
is no longer available and we currently don't have the resources to develop a new solution based of the NOA feed from Ardmore.

We'll be removing from the website in the interim.


Thanks,

Dave

Here are my notes from today's call.  As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject.

Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review.  
Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines
Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS).  Enron has approx. $8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns.  Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion.  An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets.  
Under Review:  EGM, EIM.  These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability.  Required resource levels are being carefully studied.  Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates.  
Approximately $800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter.  These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets.  
Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of $500MM-1Bn.  Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says.
Short-term liquidity is provided by the $3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the $1Bn of new debt, and the $1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy.  Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity.  Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt.
McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles:
Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets.  It was initially capitalized with $950MM of 144a debt and $125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors).  The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets.  Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation).  The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies.  The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water.  As long as Wessex is worth at least $2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required.  If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide $650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt.  This $650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances.  
Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'.  It was initially capitalized with $2.4Bn of 144a debt and $220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals).  As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) $1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup.  Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. $600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity.  The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked Notes are predominantly commodity transactions entered into with 'large financial institutions'.  The underlying transactions are already on Enron's balance sheet.  McMahon says that there is no Enron share obligation related to these instruments.
Dynegy has reviewed all of these vehicles, McMahon says.
Our 10Q will be filed five days late.  The 10Q will include all of this detail regarding the off-balance-sheet vehicles.
The special committee investigation is still ongoing.  The committee meets 2-3 times/week, sometimes more often.  The outside auditors (D&T) and external counsel hired by the committee are working 'virtually 7 days a week'.  Lay estimates that it will take the committee several more weeks to complete its investigation.
McMahon says it's 'way too early to tell' if any asset writedowns are called for.  That analysis is underway, but it will not be complete for some time.  
Osprey contains the European power projects (Trakya and Saarlux), some North American merchant investments, and some Brazilian assets.  
Under the merger agreement, Enron cannot dispose of assets representing more than 15% of the balance sheet without Dynegy approval.  However, an appendix to the agreement holds a list of assets that are specifically permitted to be sold without Dynegy approval.  
Broadband is expected to be fully wound up 'sometime over the course of the next year'.  (Did not catch this part clearly).  
The ENE topup obligation for Marlin (represented by ENE common that would have to be delivered) will be converted into an obligation for an equivalent amount of DYN shares upon closing.  
$1.9Bn of debt is carried at the Azurix level.  
Current book value of the Osprey assets is $2.1Bn.  
No Dynegy outs other than the previously discussed general MAC clause and the $3.5Bn legal liability clause.  
Yosemite and the Credit-Linked notes are functionally equivalent to ENE senior unsecured debt (this section somewhat unclear).  The underlying transactions represented volumes of 'crude oil and gas'.  The transactions relate to the 'physical movement' of these commodities.  The swaps related to Yosemite and the CLNs would be financially settled.  
Whalley was asked about the return of trading business to normal volumes.  He said that he cannot yet give an update on the progress of customers returning to our longer-term products.  Acknowledges that a few anxious customers put long-term deals on hold last week.  Says that our first focus is on getting our short-term business back up to normal levels.  It will be 'a couple of weeks' before we're able to give an update on the comfort levels of our customers regarding long-term deals with us.  
McMahon:  There hasn't been a major relaxation of credit requirements by our customers--credit requirements continue to follow strict contractual provisions as called for in our individual agreements with our various customers.  But 'we have seen a return of some of the transactions, some of the flows.'
Whalley says that we're hoping to see a return to more normal trading levels late this week or early next week.
Lay says that cost cuts will be made across of all of our businesses.  The situation gives us an opportunity to review our entire cost structure, he says.  The cuts will certainly be deeper in our non-core businesses.  Whalley then quickly interjects (some might say interrrupts) with a clarification that there are no plans to reduce the size of our North American energy trading business.  We will be looking at, perhaps, streamlining some of our processes and making prudent adjustments, but there are no plans to reduce the size of the business.
McMahon:  "The company is overlevered; that's a fact."--hence our pursuit of additional equity.
McMahon mentions that business was better at the start of this week than at the end of last week.
ENE had approx. $1Bn in cash as of 9/30, which McMahon points out would be unusual for us.  

As before, give me a call at 3-3055 if you'd like more color.

We plan to have a conference call at 2pm Sunday to discuss progress.  We want to reallocate dollars which have been returned to the pool and ensure we keep the process moving and any contracts redone by the UBS team in preparation for Monday.  David is going to send an email with contact numbers etc for questions people may have with regard to the contracts (apart from the numbers and promotions) as all those questions need to be sent to HR.

Please make sure you contact all of your guys and have an idea of where they are at.

Tammie will contact you all with the dial in number.

The meeting will be in John's office.

Thanks

Louise

NewPower to offer another pilot program to Houston employees


Free remote energy management solution helps you to manage rising energy bills.
NewPower is launching a revolutionary technology pilot to the first 500 people to sign up in the Houston area.  The NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution is a pilot program designed to give consumers control of their thermostat via the Internet.  The program will allow thermostats to be adjusted from anywhere, with any Internet-enabled device, including computers, web-enabled cell phones, palm OS devices, or pocket PCs.  Sears Home Central will install and service the Remote Energy Management Solution at no charge throughout the duration of the pilot program.  For a typical household, the three-month pilot could result in up to 10 percent to 15 percent utility bill savings, based on personal usage and the size of your home.  


Be among the first to participate absolutely free.
Enrollment with the NewPower Connections Remote Energy Management Solution pilot program starts May 14 and continues through the end of the month.  For more information about this offer, visit NewPower's table located in the Plaza of the Enron Building near the down escalator from 11:00 a.m. to 2 p.m. during the week of May 14.  To become a pilot participant you need only to be a homeowner in the Houston area and have Internet access.  You do not even have to be a NewPower electricity customer to participate.  For more information about NewPower Connections, send an e-mail to connections@newpower.com.


Disclaimers:
Any contract for goods or services that is entered into by an Enron employee with respect to the NewPower program shall be solely between NewPower and such employee.  Enron assumes no obligation on behalf of NewPower and makes no representations, warranties, or guaranties with respect to NewPower, any goods or services offered or provided by NewPower.

Group...
Well the move to Netco begins.  I would like to schedule a meeting for Wednesday, January 2nd at 10:00 a.m. to discuss the below and map out our plan of action.  As I am sure you are aware, this is our course to set, so let's think outside the framework on the most effective way to start a new company.
 
I am following e-mail from home.  If you have thoughts/concerns/questions prior to the meeting, let me know.
 
Happy New Year to everyone!
 
Laura

Subject: Re-start/Integration Planning



We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are in the final stages of completion including:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

I spoke with Adam Plager about his team implementing the additional requirements for Site Track.  I will be meeting with their developer Wei Tai tomorrow to cover the specifications and hopefully can provide you with some timelines after that.

Fred,
I will be in Houston Wednesday and Thursday this week and would like to set a time to discuss Peoples.  Until then, will you please discontinue all communication with Judy Pokorny and all subsidiaries of Peoples.  This is in line with the brief conversation we had last week.  Judy took this information directly to the President of Peoples, Tom Patrick and he discussed it with me at a 2:30pm meeting today.

Regards,

Laura Luce

Judy forwarded an "Enron Market Outlook" to PGL MGMT from Freddy-boy.  Is she trying to make us look bad?  Why is Fred going after this business?

Regarding: energy trading positions 
 
To Hunter Shively:
 
I am writing to you to express my desire to be apart of the Wholesale Power and Gas Trading operation that will potentially be created with an entity that has a high credit rating.  I have been working for Rogers Herndon in Enron Wholesale Services on the Options Desk.  In this role I have modeled the power options that are embedded in the various deals done through Enron Energy Services with large industrial and commercial clients.  In addition, I profitably managed the positions and priced deals for structurers and originators.  I realize that now is a difficult time but am confident that I would make an excellent addition to your team for several key reasons:
 
?         Proven experience in the financial markets and direct trading experience in various markets, including electricity and natural gas, mortgage backed securities, U.S. Treasury securities, foreign exchange, EuroCurrency and EuroDollar deposits
?         Team player and high work ethic, successfully balancing trading opportunities with managing risk
?         Solid portfolio management and risk management experience in electricity and mortgage banking 
?         Five years direct experience in trading, risk management, structured products and marketing of electricity for the United States
?         Actively involved in the physical markets and strong understanding of the western grid
?         Experience trading OTC forwards and options at major hubs in other NERC regions such as Cinergy, Entergy, ERCOT, NEPOOL and PJM
?         Worked for both unregulated power marketers and regulated utility
?         Extensive experience in derivatives and structured products
?         Ability to effectively work with marketers pricing and structuring deals for industrial and commercial end users of energy
?         Strength in mentoring junior traders
 
Thank you,

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do "reality checks", create a "rallying point" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the "same page" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

At the request of the NEB, TransCanada has sent out a notice to shippers and interested parties
for comments on TCPL's application addressing the proposed Mainline Services and Pricing 
Settlement.  They are also requesting comments on "the need for and the nature of a further process
to consider the Application".   Comments must be filed by Wednesday, May 23,2001.  

Kevin Heal from our Calgary Office, represented Enron in the Settlement discussions.  Enron elected
to abstain when the vote was taken to approve the Settlement.  Sithe/Independence voted to
oppose and litigate the Settlement.

To maximize the value of the Sithe/Independence TCPL capacity (i.e. St. Clair to Chippawa & Kirkwall
to Chippawa contracts), it is very important that Sithe continue to actively participate in the
NEB's regulatory process and file comments by the deadline.  Behind the scenes, I 
recommend that we work with Sithe's legal counsel to coordinate a response to this 
request in case this capacity is assigned to Enron at a later date.  

I also recommend that Enron either change our earlier position from abstention to 
opposition of the Settlement, or combine the Empress to Chippawa contract that is
dedicated to the Sithe/Independence deal with Sithe's other capacity.  Kevin has 
provided the attached information of the other Toll Task Force members that voted to abstain, 
oppose, or oppose and litigate the Settlement.  It appears that most of the marketers, cogens and
IPP's fall in this camp.  

There are several features to the Settlement that may create additional value that 
has not yet been captured in our restructuring analysis.  I believe that only by taking 
an aggressive stand in the regulatory process, can this additional value be realized.  TCPL's
"FT Make-Up" and "AOS" features will create additional value for 2001 and 2002.   The "Turnback
Procedure" is designed to mitigate actual costs of TCPL's proposed Waddington and Niagara
expansions.  If some, or all of Sithe's capacity can be turned back to the pipeline, value may be
created starting in late 2002 and possibly through the termination of Sithe's contracts.

If there is any other information needed or I can assist in any way, please call me at x31667.

Ruth

Ryan is waffling.  I talked to him this weekend and he said his wife wants to move back north.   These weather guys need physcology treatement.   Dave now thinks this UBS deal is full of risk.   I think the Friday event has everyone freaked out.
 
Sorry to ruin your Sunday evening.   With respect to fundies, I already have my guys working on this.

Ok So I'm having trouble letting go.......
 
9:00 am  Greg and I and Louise will meet with the back office to discuss staff.
10:00 am  We will meet discuss staff.  We need to have further meeting later with our staff to determine if we should offer other people jobs.  We have a lot of front office spots.  Slone, you need to get us a front office count by region.
 
I suggest that Hunter and Dave Ryan coordinate interviews for outside weather guys for next Monday.  We should bring in 10 if we can and hire 2 or 3.   I suggest Presto works with Gaskill and Will and the H guy I can't spell in Portland to put together gas and power fundies presentations for a week Tuesday.  I would like to have a clue before I start trading.
 
Hunter on the gas trading side I say we put all front office into 4 groups and give them a task to come up with the best Organization structure.   It will get everyone working.  We need that.  I would suggest that we start projecting our groups to death so they're focused on business.
 
I also suggest we put all the screens on the floor to commodity prices to keep people from watching Enron shit all day.

A promotion to VP. 

And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp. 

Hunter and I think it is very important.

Fines:

     I know you have talked with Phillip but I wanted to give my two cents.  I think the fines are a great idea. We must be accountable for VAR.  However the fines do not allow the desks to push the envelope.  The desks need to stay a couple million under VAR to protect against volatility and factor changes.  We do not have the tools to predict our VAR with any strong degree of accuracy but we are penalized for going over a few hundred thousand dollars.  I propose a one day grace period of 10% to 12% over limit.  This would allow the desks to max their VAR and protect against unexpected changes.

EOL:

We continue to have trouble with brokers not working our EOL numbers.

We believe Dynegy has written a program to mirror our cash markets on their system. When we suspend, they suspend and as our markets move, so do theirs.

Group Discussions                                                                                                                                                 
Beginning this week, Enron's EAP provider, Innovative Resources Group, will be facilitating group discussions for employees who are interested in attending.

Hunter,
There is no need to reschedule.  I will follow up with settlements and risk to make sure the $800,000 gets allocated back to our books.

FYI...

I just wanted to let you know that I have been working with the settlements group in order to put approx. $800,000.00 into the Central and East desk books for Devon penalties that have been incurred over the last year.  Settlements should be talking with the Risk group in order to get this done soon.   We are also working to determine the Pipeline cash out as a result of Panaco's imbalance over the last year.  After talking with legal it appears that we do have remedy to recoup cash out from Panaco. I'll keep you informed when I have more information.  If you have any questions please let me know.

Mark

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

January 24, 2002
Dear John Lavorato, Hunter Shively, Andy Lewis, and Chris Gaskill:

I regret to inform you that I will be resigning from the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture and will await further direction in the effort to fulfill my current obligations.  It is definitely with a bit of sadness that I have arrived at the conclusion to leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture, but I believe that it is in the best interest of my young career.  In addition, after signing a UBS offer letter I have realized over the last two days that given my current assignment it would be very difficult for me to continue to be motivated and to produce in the manner that would please both management and myself. Therefore I believe it is in the best interest of both parties that I leave the new Enron/UBS Warburg venture. Although this decision was not an easy one for me to make, I have decided to pursue other opportunities. 
I am extremely grateful for the opportunities I have been given here in this organization and for the investments that both you as individuals and the organization as a whole have made in my personal career development.  I believe I have worked hard at Enron and I trust that I made significant value adding contributions. It is because of my experience here and the tutelage that all of you have given me that I have my current knowledge and opportunities. I am very grateful for all of my experiences here at Enron/UBS Warburg, and I would like to personally thank all of you guys upon your return from Connecticut.  I will also make a concerted effort to maintain contact with all of you.
UBS Warburg Energy will certainly be a successful organization and I wish you all the best of luck with the exciting challenge of rebuilding this great business.
I await your direction upon receiving my intention to resign, and I offer my services in order to make the process as smooth as possible. 

Sincerely,
Denver Plachy

In an effort to protect Enron's e-mail system from harmful viruses, the Global Messaging Team has implemented an inbound and outbound cluster of MAILSweeper servers. What does that mean to you, the user? All inbound and outbound Internet mail is passed through a set of servers that will scan each message for viruses, malicious code, business related-content and inappropriate content. Inbound Internet mail that contains the following attachment types will be quarantined (held for delivery): *.vbs, *.exe, *.com, *.bat, *.cmd. If you are the intended recipient of one of these e-mails, you will receive an automatic notification with instructions on how to get your legitimate e-mail released from quarantine.

We have taken these measures to protect our e-mail environment from harmful e-mail viruses. We believe that these protections will result in less down time for your e-mail, in the event that Enron gets hit with a virus or malicious code.

Hunter, did you ask me to take your name off the distribution list for FERC updates that we send out?  Looks like I've deleted you from the masters, and I can't remember why I did it.

Guys:
Here is another of the closed transactions for this quarter.  We need to identify target customers specific to these transactions and turn the structure/concept into a mass solicitation.   

I am setting a meeting for next week to go over the closed transactions and product development ideas.  I will be in Houston for the entire week and can be reached at 713/853-3855.

Thanx,
Laura

Congrats to Cary on the deal!

Cilco Gas / Power Deal

The following transaction was closed with Cilco on May 1st.  The transaction was worked 
in combination with the Power group.  

ENA buys a daily gas put @ $4.00 strike  -  Jan '02 thru Dec '02  -  NGPL Midcont  10,000/day (physical)

ENA sells power to CILCO into Illinois Power  -  Sep '01 thru May '02  -  20 MW;  5 X 16 @ $26.00

The key to the transaction is that CILCO is a gas/power combo utility.  The gas utility was willing to sell the 
gas option and allow the premium to be applied to a discounted power sale.  The profit from power sales can be
applied to their bottom line.

Summary:

Counterparty:  	Central Illinois Light Company
Structure:	ENA buys option / ENA applies premium to something the customer values
Term:		Any term structure that works for the customer

Value Proposition for Customer:  Transfer of premium to bottom line dollars
Value Proposition for Enron:	Cross commodity deal;  Gas option ownership;  Term deal with possible restructure at a later date

Value created:		$479,000	-	$229,660 Origination (Gas and Power)
							
						$250,000 Risk premium reserve for IP delivery

Required documentation:	Master Contracts

Potential Targets:	Gas / Power Combo Utilities with the ability to capture bottom line dollars.
			Utilities with unregulated affiliates

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Cary

I apologies for the vagueness of my email, however as you know we have attempted to build various implementations/prototypes/plasma applications involving EOL data. The basis of most of our real-time work is around the messages distributed by EOL over tibco, i.e. product bid/offer/volume information.

In addition, I was approached by the EOL team because there were concerns that certain traders were hitting the EOL database too frequently (Dutch Q. - P/L report). The only way to resolve this would be use the real-time EOL deal transaction information.

Thus I corresponded on many occasions with various people in the EOL group, requesting information to help us gain a further understanding of the EOL system in order to facilitate the above. In addition, I requested a meeting with certain EOL team member ... this was declined (response was that they did not have enough information).

Out of frustration, I contacted David Forster. He asked me to forward all questions to him directly, and he would pass them to Michael Guadarrama, with a note to me saying that if my question was not answered by the following day, let me know ... etc ...

I really don't have the time to go through this painful process of having to forward my questions to a VP !!! So, I tried to contact Michael directly, the following transcript is the consequence.

Not to sound like a broken record Hunter but EOL data analysis is becoming more and more important to Gas Fundamentals, and without support from the EOL group, it can only make our life more difficult.

Colin,

Can you get me the XML schemas or DTDs for EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.SITARA and EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.TAGG?

I need to figure out the mappings for conterparty id, price, volume, etc.

Attached are the msgs captured on the TIB.

Ed McMichael asked me to send you our spread option model.  It is attached below. The paths are based on what John Lavarato asked to see.

 

Let me know if you have questions.  Of course, your input is appreciated.

 11/19/01 Smith (ankle) could not finish Sunday's game. His status for Thur=
sday's game against Dallas is unclear.  Terance Mathis , WR ATL - Frank Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Mathis has by far his best game of the season, catching seven=
 passes for 70 yards against Green Bay. He suffered a mild concussion in th=
e game, but he's expected to be fine for this weekend's contest at Carolina=
.   Jackie Harris , TE DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Harris suffered a =
strained right hamstring during Sunday's game against Philadelphia. He did =
not return to the contest, and is listed as day to day.   Frank Sanders , W=
R ARI - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Sanders had a huge game against Detroit=
 on Sunday, catching seven passes for 127 yards and a touchdown. He injured=
 his hamstring in the game, however, and is listed as day to day.   Quincy =
Carter  , QB DAL - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Carter feels as though his h=
amstring has healed enough that he's ready to return to action. However, th=
e Cowboys will start Ryan Leaf for a few more weeks before Carter gets his =
starting job back. The team wants to evaluate Leaf in a few games this seas=
on to determine if he'll have any trade value in the offseason.   James Jac=
kson , RB CLE - Hunter Updated 11/19/01 Jackson told the Cleveland Plain-De=
aler it was a coach's decision not to use him against the Ravens. Jackson h=
ad been suffering from an ankle injury, but reports prior to gametime had i=
ndicated he might have been able to play. With the sudden emergence of Benj=
amin Gay, Jackson's Fanta! sy! value might drop greatly.  Ryan Leaf , QB DA=
L - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01 Leaf had another terrible outing this weeke=
nd, but the Dallas Morning News is reporting that he'll remain the team's s=
tarting quarterback for the time being. However, he's no better than waiver=
 wire fodder in Fantasy Football.   Kevin Lockett , WR WAS - Free Agent Upd=
ated 11/19/01 Lockett left Sunday's game against Denver in the first quarte=
r due to a rib injury. His status for next week's game against Philadelphia=
 is uncertain at this time. !  Tony Banks , QB WAS - Free Agent Updated 11/=
19/01 Banks, who suffered a concussion during Sunday's game against Denver,=
 told the Washington Post that there's a "definite possibility" he would be=
 ready in time for next weekend's game against Philadelphia. Kent Graham wo=
uld start if Banks is unable to play, but neither QB is an attractive Fanta=
sy option against the Eagles.   Emmitt Smith , RB DAL - Bass/Hull Updated 1=
1/19/01 Smith left Sunday's game against Philadelphia with a sprained knee.=
 However, he is expected to be in the starting lineup when Dalla! s ! faces=
 Denver on Thanksgiving Day.   Larry Foster , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 1=
1/19/01 Foster suffered an apparent leg injury during Sunday's game against=
 Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Desmond Howard , WR DET - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/19/01 Howard suffered a shoulder injury during Sunday's win ove=
r Arizona. He did not return to the game, and is listed as day to day.   Be=
rt Emanuel! , WR DET - Free Agent Updated 11/19/01Emanuel suffered a knee i=
njury during Sunday's game against Arizona. He is listed as day to day.  Mu=
hsin Muhammad , WR CAR - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Muhammad sprained his left=
 shoulder in Sunday's game against the 49ers. His status for the Week 11 ga=
me against Atlanta is unclear.  Mike Anderson , RB DEN - Neal/McKay Updated=
 11/18/01 Anderson rushed for only 31 yards on 13 carries against the Redsk=
ins. Olandis Gary carried the ball 10! t! imes for 28 yards. It is apparent=
 Anderson is no longer worthy of a starting spot on Fantasy teams, and Gary=
 will continue to see some work at his expense.  Michael Westbrook , WR WAS=
 - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Westbrook caught nine passes for 104 yards a=
nd a TD at Denver. Opposing defenses are focusing on rookie Rod Gardner, an=
d Westbrook is getting open often after starting the year slowly.  Jake Plu=
mmer , QB ARI - Frank Updated 11/18/01 Plummer threw for 334 yards, four TD=
s and was intercepted once by Detroit. Such stellar performances are rare f=
or Plummer, who may not have a better game this season.  Michael Pittman , =
RB ARI - Matty Updated 11/18/01 The awful Detroit defense limited Pittman t=
o 81 rushing yards on 23 carries. Don't start Pittman in any upcoming weeks=
 unless your team is very thin at RB..  David Sloan , TE DET - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/18/01 Sloan caught two TD passes for a total of three yards at Ar=
izona. If you are desperate for help at TE, consider Sloan! , ! who always =
gets regular looks from Charlie Batch.  Lamont Warren , RB DET - Free Agent=
 Updated 11/18/01 Warren rushed for 32 yards and a TD at Arizona and caught=
 11 passes for 64 yards and a score. The Lions will continue to feature War=
ren on third downs and near the goal line as a receiver, making him a good =
Fantasy backup for the rest of the year.  Warrick Dunn , RB TB - Martin Upd=
ated 11/18/01 Dunn caught 12 passes for 138 yards against the Bears, but he=
 rushed for only 12 yards and fumbled twice. Don't count on Dunn for consis=
tently good Fantasy numbers during the next few weeks. He can be explosive,=
 but he is also erratic.  Keyshawn Johnson , WR TB - Giggles Updated 11/18/=
01 Johnson caught 12 passes for 89 yards against the Bears, but he failed t=
o get in the end zone again. Don't depend on Johnson down the stretch unles=
s your team is very thin at wideout.  David Terrell , WR CHI - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/18/01 Terrell caught o! ne! pass for 15 yards at Tampa Bay. The r=
ookie wideout is not consistent enough to start for most Fantasy teams.  Ma=
rty Booker , WR CHI - Free Agent Updated 11/18/01 Booker caught seven passe=
s for 165 yards and three TDs at Tampa Bay. In his third season, Booker has=
 become a superb Fantasy wideout. He is a player you must start every week,=
 no matter what matchup he faces.   Plaxico Burress , WR PIT - Free Agent U=
pdated 11/18/01 The Jaguars limited Burress to one catch for 13 yards. The =
second-year receiver has still not proven he can be a reliable Fantasy play=
er.  LaDainian Tomlinson , RB SD - Hunter Updated 11/18/01 Tomlinson put up=
 decent rushing numbers against Oakland, posting 68 yards and a touchdown. =
His overall statistics have been down in recent weeks, however, which may h=
ave something to do with the fact that he held out for the entire preseason=
.   Hines Ward , WR PIT - Tori Updated 11/18/01 Ward caught nine passes for=
 112 yards and a TD against Jacks! on! ville. While he doesn't score often,=
 Ward has become a very solid receiver for Pittsburgh this year, and he wil=
l always post respectable totals.  Doug Flutie , QB SD - Russell Updated 11=
/18/01 Flutie's recent struggles continued against Oakland, throwing for on=
ly 98 yards on Sunday. Unless he faces a good matchup, starting Flutie is b=
ecoming somewhat of a gamble.   Stacey Mack , RB JAC - Hunter Updated 11/18=
/01 Mack was held to six rushing yards on eight carries at Pittsburgh. He h=
as not been a reliable back for the Jaguars or Fantasy owners this season. =
 Rich Gannon , QB OAK - Martin Updated 11/18/01 Gannon had a solid outing a=
gainst San Diego, throwing for 311 yards and four touchdowns. He's one of t=
he top five Fantasy quarterbacks in the league and is a must-start every we=

In a strategic move to provide relative probability to moving enovate (JV with Peoples Energy) to UBS, I believe it is critical to show Peoples our support of the office in Chicago.  The potential of this outcome increases two fold, by ensuring Gregg Penman and Richard Tomaski are employees of UBS.  Neither received an offer due to decisions made outside my control.  We have now given odds that enovate will move into Newco or be sold to a third party.  I believe this outcome is disheartening to all of us involved.  It was my goal to salvage as much of the PEC relationship as possible and meetings held in Chicago this week were essential as a first step.  I have continued to believe in this business model whether with Peoples or elsewhere and I belive strongly that Gregg and Richard are essential staff.  They "know" how to run it and none of our competitors have suceeded in this business.. 
 
My team believed in a business model and followed through in relocating their families, setting up a business with a "real" customer (that Enron all to often discounted) and created something that a significant list of third parties want to buy (BP Amoco, Oxy, Sempra, PanCanadian, El Paso, Sempra, CMS, Duke, and Dynegy).  This relationship has created over $130MM dollars of MTM for Enron without consideration of the information trading obtained.  This was not a transaction, but a business.  
 
My recommendation for Gregg and Richard is to immediately provide an offer that requires a non-compete of 1 year with consideration of $60,000 at 6 months and $60,000 at one year, with the promise of stock in year 2.  
 
We do not want these guys at a competitor or with Newco.  No one else in the industry has the ability to run as quickly as we will if we have this team together.  You can hold me to that.  
 
I can be reached at home at 713/528-9854.
 
Laura

Deskheads:

I would like to have a 2 hour team building session for the assistants, receptionists, and clerks on Friday 5/25/01.  The only thing that will be charged to your cost center is the cost of a lunch brought in for the administrative staff.  

I know that the assistants usually are out of here between 12:30 to 1:30 being that this is a Friday before a holiday.   I would like to have the session start at 12:30 so that they can still be out of here by 2:30 that day.  This would require the phones being on solo pilot starting at 12:30.

Please respond with your approval, questions and/or comments as soon as time permits so I can set everything up this week.

Many thanks,
Ina Rangel

Given the growth in EES it has become apparent that it is time to consolidate the risk functions between EES and EWS.  This will provide EES with the systems, resources and risk expertise of the wholesale energy groups necessary for it to continue to grow and take advantage of current market opportunities.

With this in mind and in agreement with the management of EES, two new risk groups inside Enron Americas will be formed to provide EES with pricing, structuring, retail and wholesale commodity risk management, logistics and back-office services.  These groups main function is to provide these services to EES.  We have asked Rogers Herndon, currently Vice President-Trading in the Eastern Power Group to manage this function in the Eastern Interconnect (this includes both gas and power).  Rogers will continue to report to Kevin Presto.  We have asked Don Black, formerly Vice President-EES Risk Management and Sourcing, to manage this function in the Western U.S.  Don will manage this group from Houston and will report to Tim Belden.

These groups will work very closely with EES to pursue shared goals while ensuring close coordination with the wholesale gas and power trading organizations.

These changes are effective immediately.  Please congratulate Rogers and Don on their new roles.

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Subject:	PROTEST AT ENRON CHICAGO...............

.........Frank and I are in Chicago on business.  

It's Monday morning and I'm sitting in the office waiting for Frank to get here when all of a sudden 50 people of the street come on to the trade floor with protest signs (a group called ACORN).  They are protesting the high natural gas prices and wanted us to fax a letter to Ken Lay condemning him for being a money hungry CEO.  
They were chanting and singing protest songs...............and had TV cameras with them.  All business had to be stopped for about half an hour.  It was funny cause they were saying things like...."look they all have palm pilots.......".   Well the COPS showed up and threatened to arrest them if they did not leave...............
It was really funny in a way but, also makes one think about the kind of misdirected information that people are fed by the media.....
So that's the protest story from Chicago.......

Thanks

Bharat

Hunter, I spoke with Heather Purcell who is kind of like the intermediate between IT and business in terms of web based commodity information. Basically I informed her that CF was now being released to the gas trader/originators and showed her the message board features for each commodity (have a look on the site .. very cool). 

Anyway, when I proposed to her that it would be in her interest to encourage her users to use CF, and that it will not allow a single point of reference for weather information etc. I experienced immediate resistance. Heather basically informed me that her boss, Shankman would not be using the site because it did not contain the power information!! My response was why not use the site at least to facilitate the communication between crude + gas in the mean-time, basically integral markets.

... anyway, I think the basic problem is that Heather et al  have spent a great deal of time + money on the design of all 10 or so EGM sites (prob over 100k), and now her is one site that does it all and more !!! 

I know you realize the issues, but for this to be a completely effect tool for the traders, we really need buy in from EGM. I appreciate Heather's resistance, however you can't stop progress.

What do you think ??

Fellas,

Presto has asked me to be the contact to Allan Stewart at PIRA with regard to setting up an arrangement for their consulting services.  I'm currently having information-gathering discussions over services and fees for both gas and power, in both the east and west.  In order to fully incorporate everyone's needs into our arrangement with PIRA, I'll be contacting you this week to gather requests.  Or, if you know what you need, please just reply to me with the specific information.

Thanks,

Fletch

It's my turn, I've asked for nothing 

I need Caroline Abramo

As well as her bonus we need

100k and 100k contract.

A promotion to VP.

And she wants to report Calger and Milnthorp.

Hunter and I think it is very important.

Hunter, 
I realize two is a party and three a crowd, but would you be okay with me "crashing" your meetings with Penman.  People's is unable to meet on Friday and has asked to postpone until Monday.  If I can still met with you and Penman and be part of the process, I rather not reschedule, and keep my current plans.  However, if you believe I would not add value, I can easily reschedule for next week.

Frank
PS.  If I keep my current agenda, I would arrange a trip later in the summer and visit with Judy via telephone.

Mike, looks good. My own rank had Shannon ahead of Suzanne but they are real close in my mind, although for different reasons. The numbers Hunter and I discussed had your scheduling team at four. Once we get feedback from the other desk heads we might need to rework our total for Logistics if that is even possible at this point.

Bob

Bob,

I talked with Hunter about the west logistics organizational chart.  We came up with the following list, which I believe matches your recommendation.

Randy Gay
Patti Sullivan
Shelly Mendel
Suzanne Christiansen
Shannon Groenewold


If we were to enter a scenario that reduced the analyst level on my desk, I would recommend that we discuss the placement of Susan Scott and/or Jason Wolfe in west logistics.  They have both performed at high level in logistics and offer the new company a longer term skill set than a few of the people listed in our west logistics org chart.

Please let me know what your thoughts are regarding the unfortunate scenario mentioned above.

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby

 *  *  *  *  *    NOTE:  PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING...   *  *  *  *  *


With ECS (Enron Center South) rapidly approaching completion, Enron is forced to change the numbering scheme on the existing Stentofon system.  To increase our capacity to support this expansion, we must increase the number of valid Stentofon address numbers.  Enron currently uses 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600 and 900 series numbers for the addresses.  In order to add more addresses to the system, Enron will be converting the dial plan from a three digit dialing system to a four digit dialing scheme on the Stentofon system.  This conversion is scheduled to occur on the weekend of May 18th.

In efforts to minimize the number of times each user will change their number, we will be converting all Stentofon addresses in EB1 that are scheduled to move into ESC this year to a 5000 series number.    (i.e.  If your Stento number was 364, then your new number will be 5364.)  We will also change all speed dials to reflect the new dialing scheme.  Please instruct the users within your group of this change.

All Enron Broadband Stentofons will have their numbers changed to a 4000 series number.  (i.e.  If your Stento number was 576, then your new number will be 4576.)  

In summary, all Stentofon numbers will be changing this weekend.  If you are scheduled to move into ECS, then your Stento number will begin with a '5' and if you are to remain at EB1, then your Stento number will begin with a '4'.

Please inform all users of the Stentofon System of this change and pass this information to anyone that needs it.


Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Another CERA report - this one is a 20+ page report that is probably more bullish than the short one I forwarded you yesterday

Title: Quarterly Natural Gas Watch: Customers on the Margin

E-mail Category: Watch

CERA Knowledge Area(s):

North American Gas - http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2397

***********************************************************************

A DIFFICULT TRANSITION

Supply is limiting the size of the North American gas market--and customers
will remain on the margin in the gas industry through this year and next.
Although the long-awaited rebound in US gas supply has begun, supplies are not
yet sufficient to allow for complete gains in storage or power demand or for
the return of gas demand that has switched to alternative fuels.

Because prices have fallen quickly in recent days during the publication cycle,
CERA  has elected to move forward with publication of this Natural Gas Watch in
tandem with an updated price outlook, contained in the May 15 CERA Monthly
Briefing. CERA's latest expectation for prices can be found in the Monthly
Briefing.  Otherwise, the message of the Natural Gas Watch remains valid.

* A return to more moderate and stable price levels is not likely during 2001
  and is far from assured even for 2002.

* The crisis this past winter has changed consumers' and investors'
  expectations and planning in ways that may affect the market for the next
  decade.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Hey Hunter, 
FYI - I will be out this afternoon for our PRC meeting.  And tomorrow Cora and I leave for Chicago- we will be there all day Wednesday and come back on Thursday.  We are flying up there so that we can work on the set up for the Allegehny and Constellation Power Plants.  I am going to leave at noon tomorrow so that I can order appliances for my kitchen before I need to be at the airport.  Mark will attend the afternoon meetings to keep you up to date on any logistics issues. 

One more thing - this weekend they are going to migrate Unify to the new sequel server platform.  They are going to take Unify down at 2:00pm on Friday to start the process -so any assistance on Friday morning in finishing early would be appreciated.  We will need to get all the weekend noms done before it goes down.  Unify should be up and running Saturday morning - we will be in here testing Sat morn to make sure that it is performing o.k. so that Monday will go smoothly.
Thanks
Lisa

I want to take a moment to thank each of you for having a summer Analyst or Associate work on your team. I also want to remind everyone what a high stakes activity this is for Enron.
Based on your recommendation, we will make offers at the end of the summer to those interns who perform, and who you endorse as a potential future member of your team. Those interns who have had a good experience and accept our offer will be the lowest risk hires we make - from any source. We will have effectively interviewed and watched them work for 2-3 months. They also have the potential to be the most effective advocates and talent scouts we have, when they return to campus. On the flip side, those who don't have meaningful assignments, or have bad experiences during the summer can severely hurt our efforts.
Thank you again for being part of this very important activity. If you have any questions, or if areas of concern arise during the summer, please contact Ted Bland (x35275), Traci Warner (x33242) or me (x36671).
We appreciate your contributions to this important effort for Enron. 
Billy

TEXAS GETS CAUGHT UP IN A POWER PLAY /Energy Alley to blame for California's woes? 

By ANN HODGES, Houston Chronicle TV Critic
Staff



Frontline joins hands with the New York Times tonight, to jump into what California Gov. Gray Davis has turned into a marathon news blast at Texas, and at Houston, over his state's energy woes. 

Frontline : Blackout, airing at 10 tonight, should have Davis and his bash-Texas troops giving each other high fives. 

In its opening minutes, Frontline 's narration sets a tone for Texas-bashing: 

"Investigators (otherwise unidentified) claim that a handful of energy companies siphoned billions from consumers while the lights (in California) were out. 

"If you want to understand the story of electric power in America today, you have to follow the electrons and follow the money. It's a story that starts here, in Houston, Texas." 

The blame game is in high gear, as Frontline 's dust-up hovers over Houston. 

Houston's Energy Alley, home of "electric cowboys" (Frontline 's words), is the focus of this "follow-the-money" trail. 

And Ken Lay, chairman of Enron, "the 800-pound gorilla" in the Alley, gets the major grilling in its high-powered interview hot seat, along with Enron CEO Jeff Skilling. 

Interviewees also include Vice President Dick Cheney, California and federal officials, other company executives, industry insiders and what Frontline calls "whistle-blowers." 

Politics and finger-pointing fuel charges and countercharges, with Frontline correspondent and New York Times contributor Lowell Bergman conducting the interviews, and an off-camera narration spinning the sound and fury. 

With blackouts expected to hit New York this summer, "the entire country will soon be short on power," Frontline asserts to set the stage. 

"The generators have made more money than God. I mean, they've made 7, 8, 900 percent profit," Davis charges. 

"Now that a fellow Texan sits in the White House," Frontline says, "the companies on Energy Alley are hoping things will only get better. . . . Lay is a personal friend and big backer of President Bush, and he and his executives have been the Bush family's most generous contributors. . . . " 

"There are a few of us that are still maybe idealistic enough to think that we can kind of support a candidate because we really believe in the individual," Lay counters. "We believe in their policies. We believe in the direction they are going to take the country." 

El Paso Corp., the largest natural gas company, gets its lumps, too, from California officials. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) was ready to dismiss California's complaint of price manipulation at the state's borders, Frontline says, "until Frontline and the New York Times obtained sealed documents revealing discussions at El Paso's highest levels." 

"Those documents are irrelevant," El Paso spokeswoman Peggy Heeg says. 

Frontline passes its golden opportunity to lay out, clearly and concisely, both sides - what critics say are the self-inflicted origins of California's energy crisis, and California's charges of price-gouging and pleas for price caps. Instead, that information comes piecemeal, over the course of contentious and often-confusing exchanges. 

To avoid retreat on deregulation, now in progress in 24 states, companies have begun to raise the possibility of settlement with California, Frontline reports. In Lay's opinion, "It's still going to take a comprehensive settlement of the whole issue, all the issues" - including money. 

Give Frontline full credit for stepping in where no other TV news outlet has dared to tread in such depth. Something is surely better than nothing. 

But this Frontline /New York Times team coverage effort does not cool the blame game. It sheds more heat than light. 

Frontline : Blackout, 10 tonight, 9 p.m. June 12 on Channel 8. Grade: B.

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

Houston Ballet gives free performances of Copp?lia
at Miller Outdoor Theatre in Hermann Park
8:00 p.m. Friday May 11, Saturday May 12, & Sunday May 13, 2001 
sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON

Considered the great comedy of classical ballet, Copp?lia  tells the story of a doll so enchantingly lifelike that she mesmerizes an entire village, captures the heart of a young swain named Franz and inspires the eccentric toymaker Dr. Copp?lius to attempt to transform her into a living, breathing human being. 

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston.  Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON.  These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .  (Please be aware that all unoccupied seats are released at 10 minutes before curtain.)

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line.  Tickets are not required for the lawn area.  

About Coppelia
Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: "Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue."
Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, "It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage."    (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992)
Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in 	the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.

Ken Lay announced today that he has resigned from Enron's Board of Directors.  His resignation is effective immediately.  

In a press release, Ken said, "I want to see Enron survive and successfully emerge from reorganization.  Due to the multiple inquiries and investigations, some of which are focused on me personally, I believe that my involvement has become a distraction to achieving this goal."

He added, "My concern is for current and former Enron employees and other stakeholders, and I feel that it is in their best interest for me to step down from the Board."

	Enron Recruitment Technology is launching a new, easy to use, web-based Employee Referral Program.

	This new site will help you to help Enron find the talent it needs. Referrals are one of the best sources of talent for Enron in terms of quality and fit with Enron's culture. We have found that referrals stay with the company longer and adapt faster than those hired through other sources. This site will help us run a world-class employee referral program with less work and better results. 

	There are also incentives for you. If you refer a candidate who is hired, you could be eligible to receive a cash reward of up to $5,000.

	So help someone accelerate their career, make yourself some money, and help us realize our mission of being the World's No. 1 Company.

	Check out the site - http://enron.referrals.com/promo.asp - let us know what you think -- we want to hear from you. This application should make referring easier for you so if you have suggestions that would enhance the program, send us an e-mail (Referral.Station@enron.com) or contact the Referral Station at (713) 345-3254, option 2.

	David Oxley

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphaned children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.

[IMAGE]	Fantasy Football Newsletter	
  November 16, 2001  		


	
     [IMAGE]Fantasy Sports     [IMAGE]Fantasy Football     [IMAGE]CBS SportsLine.com 	
	


  Welcome to another edition of the 2001 Fantasy Football Newsletter!      The Fantasy Football newsletter will arrive in your e-mail inbox every Friday. We'll include news about the web site; tips on using all the features available; and answers to your player-related questions from the "Gridiron Guru."   	[IMAGE]	Inside      ? Plan for the Playoffs   ? Game-by-Game Analysis   ? Gridiron Guru   ? Tip of the Week   	


 [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  [IMAGE]  	


    Plan for the Playoffs     The Fantasy season is nearing its end, and the playoffs are on the horizon. For Fantasy 2001 players, the playoffs begin with NFL week 15 (games of Dec. 22-23) and last two weeks, with the championship game in week 16 (games of Dec. 29-30.)  If you're in a Football Commissioner league, go to Schedule, Playoffs to see when your playoffs start and how many rounds they last. Of course, the matchups are probably still not determined, so you may not see teams listed in the brackets. The commissioner of your league is responsible for adding the teams to your playoff brackets at the end of your regular season.  If your team is still in contention, go to NFL Teams, Schedule and take note of the NFL teams with byes during your playoff weeks, so you know which players will be available if - and WHEN - your team competes in a playoff matchup.  	


    Game-by-Game Analysis     Go to Players, Game Log to see how a particular player did in each game this season. The player's statistics in the common categories will be displayed for each game. If you are breaking down free agents, the game log is great way to see who's been getting the most consistent production.  	


    Gridiron Guru     Welcome to Gridiron Guru, where we'll answer your questions about players and offer Fantasy Football roster advice. We invite you to send your own scouting reports and comments on players to: gridguru@commissioner.com . You'll get the chance to be heard by thousands of Fantasy players just like yourself!   	


  Question - Mike Blake     I'm having trouble filling my No. 2 WR spot. Should I start Az-Zahir Hakim, Todd Pinkston or Muhsin Muhammad in week ten?    Answer - GG     Hakim is a hit-or-miss type, so he's risky. Pinkston has done nothing in his last four games, and he's losing playing time to Freddie Mitchell. Muhammad bounced back from a few bad performances to catch six passes for 75 yards last weekend against St. Louis, and has had some past success against this week's opponent, San Francisco. Go with Muhammad.  	


  Question - Russell Brown     My league starts 2 QBs. Donovan McNabb is one  of my starters. Who else should I start? I have Tom Brady,  Vinny Testaverde and Doug Flutie.    Answer - GG     Testaverde's Fantasy value has taken a real hit this  season because of the Jets' conservative offense. Flutie  struggled last week against a bad Denver secondary, and  won't have an easier time against Oakland. We'd suggest  playing Brady, who will start against St. Louis despite the  return of Drew Bledsoe. Brady has thrown 11 touchdowns in  his last five games, and is playing too well to bench.   	


  Question - Chris Gilcrest     Who would you start at QB this weekend: Rich  Gannon or Kerry Collins? Which one of these four RBs would  you bench: Eddie George, Michael Pittman, Mike Anderson,  Curtis Martin?     Answer - GG     Collins has the better matchup of the two QBs, but  he's far too inconsistent to start over a player like  Gannon. Oakland will be looking to bounce back from a subpar  performance against Seattle, so look for Gannon to have a  solid game. As for your second question, bench Mike  Anderson. You can't bench Martin, no matter how bad the  matchup may be. George has four touchdowns in his last three  games against Cincinnati, and is worth starting despite his  struggles this season; and Pittman's matchup against Detroit  is too good to ignore.   	


    Tip of the Week      Keith Simmons, Boulder, CO: Can Terrell Davis ever stay  healthy? He comes back and teases Fantasy owners with his  solid play over the last two weeks, only to fall prey to  another knee injury this past Sunday. He was once the best  Fantasy player in the league, but now Davis is an  unreliable, injury-prone shell of his former self.

Subject:	Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum - June 20, 2001

Your Invitation to Enron's Executive Forum

The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate in an Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to those who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the past few years.  These informal, interactive forums will be approximately 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.  

Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although attendance is not mandatory, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to its executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do "reality checks", create a "rallying point" and ensure Enron's executive management is on the "same page" about where Enron is going---and why.

We realize that individuals based outside the United States will not want to make a special trip to attend the meeting, but may be able to attend one of the sessions while they are in Houston on other business.  We also hope to schedule a similar session in London later this year.

We currently have a session planned for:

Wednesday, June 20, 2001 from 3:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. in Houston, EB50M

The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here's how it will work:
?	Each session will have approximately 25 participants.
?	The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
?	This will be your forum. Don't expect to simply sit and listen to presentations.
?	This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own questions and express your own opinions.
?	You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum.
?	Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not limited to: the
direction of Enron, business goals/results, M&A activities, projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity, values, etc.

Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we encourage you to accept this invitation only if you intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to do the same.  We also ask that you refrain from canceling your attendance once enrolled so that we will not have to cancel the forum.  The Office of the Chairman is very willing to take valuable time from their busy schedules to hold these forums.  Enrollments will be on a first come first served basis and we hope you would be able to honor your commitment to attend.  For planning purposes, it is essential that you RSVP no later than Monday, June 11, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586.

We will confirm your registration with you, in writing and forward a list of enrollees to the Office of the Chairman.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson via e-mail (gerry.gibson@enron.com).  Gerry can also be reached at 713.345.6806.  

Thank you.

Listened in on the analyst call this morning.  Here are my notes.  Did not yet have a chance to organize them, so they're simply in chronological order.

The call began with Watson, Bergstrom, and Whalley reading from prepared statements.  Watson spoke for c. 10 minutes, Bergstrom for 5, and Whalley spoke for perhaps 30 seconds.  Dynegy management was noticeably in control of the call.  Enron executives spoke when questions were directed to them.  

Specific points:
EES will be a part of the new company.  
Enron assets will be revalued at closing.  
The investment in Northern Natural takes the form of convertible preferred.  If the merger does not go through, Dynegy has the right to acquire Northern for 'very little' additional consideration.  If DYN terminates the merger and ENE 'has sufficient liquidity', ENE has right to repurchase the convertible preferred.  
Debt/equity of combined company expected to be <45%.
Both companies will remain on RatingsWatch negative.  
ChevronTexaco will hold 169MM shares out of a total 650MM shares of the post-merger entity.  
Watson reiterates that going forward, the new entity will be run with a focus on transparent and clear financial structure and disclosure, with a significant reduction in on- and off-balance-sheet leverage.  
In what was termed a "new approach", the new entity will be run with a focus on cash flow rather than earnings.  
Rumors that Dynegy did the deal because of an unhedged exposure to Enron are not true.  Dynegy owed Enron <$50MM.  
Lay says that Enron had other options, 'particularly financial'.
All of the discussion and activity has taken place over the last two weeks.
Lay acknowledges that the number for exposure to securities lawsuits may be 'pretty big', but that the companies feel they're able to appropriately value this exposure.
Lay says we have nothing else to hide, but internal investigation still under way.  
Lay:  had the SPEs been capitalized with perhaps $30MM more of risk capital, there would have been no question that they would have qualified for off-balance-sheet treatment and there would have been no need to restate earnings last week to reflect consolidation of the SPEs.
Dynegy says that 'several' internal investigations continue at Enron, and thus DYN/ENE cannot say with certainty that there's absolutely nothing else out there.
Doty (Dynegy CFO) says that late last week, ENE had 'close to a billion' in cash.  
Osprey will be unwound late next summer. Marlin will be unwound after closing.
Many of the off-balance-sheet structures, including the credit-linked notes, are expected to be unwound/redeemed or at least significantly reduced prior to closing.
With regard to ENE asset dispositions, these will be accelerated to the extent possible.  However, Doty says that 'our backs are not against the wall', and the company will continue to focus on getting value for its assets as well as cash.
ENE will renew its 364-day facility (believe this is the $3Bn facility that we drew down a couple of weeks ago) within the next 6-8 weeks.  
BBB-flat most likely rating for combined entity, according to initial comments from ratings agencies.
McMahon says 'no comment' to WSJ article indicating that ENE's banks are preparing to make an equity infusion into ENE in the next few weeks.
Consolidation of trading activity: Mid- and back-office consolidation will see substantial progress prior to closing, such that only the front office / trading books will need to be combined at closing.  EES, NNG and TW have no real overlap with existing DYN activity, so there won't be much integration work required there.  The big integration effort will be ENA.
Watson says that the 'creative financing' surrounded non-core assets.  Doty adds that, 'frankly', DYN assigned zero economic value to non-core businesses in their valuation model.  They bracketed the maximum expected exposure from the non-core assets/businesses and left it at that.
Watson mentions that DYN would not have gotten involved with Enron had they not been approached by 'Enron's top three executives', who said that they thought a combination with Dynegy made the most strategic sense for both companies.  Says that their approach evidenced a  willingness to work with DYN to integrate the two companies that made a big difference in Dynegy's deliberations on proceeding with the merger.
Watson/Doty said that they're NOT 100% sure that no surprises remain in Enron's books--but that the risk/reward offered by the combination was compelling. 
The deal does have material-adverse-change outs for Dynegy, covering any MAC regarding Enron's assets or businesses.  Dynegy's lawyers indicated that the MAC language was a 'blunt instrument' under which it would be difficult to bring a case, so Dynegy inserted a specific paragraph that gives Dynegy the right to terminate the merger if the Enron's total legal liability (from any source or cause of action) tops $3.5Bn prior to closing.
McMahon adds that there 'could' be more restatements, but he 'does not expect' there to be more restatements.
ENE international hard assets definitely on the asset disposition list.
The merger structure calls for a new entity to take over Enron.
Enron is planning to hold an Enron-specific conference call in the next few days, tentatively scheduled for Wednesday.
Initial reaction of ratings agencies 'very positive' to combined entities.  
McMahon acknowledges that Enron would have had to have an additional equity infusion prior to year-end, had the merger not materialized.
Dynegy's earnings guidance places Enron-related earnings accretion at $0.90-0.95, which represents a '25% haircut' to Enron internal estimates.  Doty says that this is all operating earnings--figure does not include any amounts from expected synergies.
Doty says that both Enron and Dynegy's books, as far as he understands, are relatively short-term in weight, and this will continue to be the weighting of the new entity.  Says a 'very very substantial' portion of future trading earnings will be expected to be cash.
ChevronTexaco's investment in Dynegy was calculated at a 5% discount to public prices on the date of negotiation (not disclosed).  Given the runup in Dynegy stock last week, ChevronTexaco's investment is now at a 'more substantial' discount to market prices.  ChevronTexaco has provision to get 'different prices at closing if those prices are substantially better'.  (No further clarification given).
Whalley believes that 'we'll retain' the Enron traders and marketers. They're used to being part of a winning team, and the combined entity will definitely be a winner.  They have talked with most of the Enron business leaders, and they are 'very excited' by the combination.  They will be working with the Enron business leaders to ensure talent is retained.  Whalley was asked if there will be any key employee retention provisions.  He says that 'to the extent necessary, yes.'
Watson says that the trading strategy of the combined entity will be a combination of DYN and ENE--there will be more of an asset-backed trading focus, but by the same token the new Dynegy will be involved in much more financial market-making trading than the Dynegy of today.
Watson says that if there were to be any change in culture, he's a strong team player.  He does not want to see an individual do well if the company or division does not do well.

Give me a call if you'd like me to try to clarify any of these comments.

John,

This is my view on what may be possible:

Steve:	Issues:	1. Uncomfortable with UBS's committment to the business
		2. Surprised that no one from UBS has spoken directly with him
		3. Seems like he wants to build/run a team and is motivated by money.
		4. His interperetation of the contract is that even if this deal fails, his would be bound by a none compete until the end.

	Solution:  Money alone is not enough because does not address 1 and 2.  He needs someone (senior) from UBS to spend some time with him to:
		   (a) help him fell more comfortable with UBS's committment; (b) get him excited by the possiblity to lead/shape/direct the weather group
		   (this notion seemed to catch his interest during our discussion with him); (c) and present him with a new deal (no more of this aim for 80%
		   happy bullshit).  This new deal will need considerably less restrictive language--talk with Hunter about specifics.

Adam:	Issue:  1. Has interest in returing to the air force (his window to do so is until July 7th.)

	Solution:  Appears that money is not his first priority.  Any offer of money that precludes him from the July 7th window will be unsuccessful!
		   Our strategy needs to be one that gives him some respectable money that he can keep as long as he stays until June 1st (after he is
		   committed it may be possible to persuade him to stay longer).  He will not accept an offer that takes away his air force option!!!!!!  Also,
		   I think signing him will be alot easier once others have committed.

Jose:	Issue:	1. Recongnizes that senior management (You, Greg, and Louise) have done a good job closing the deal, but have failed to address HR
		    issues.  He thinks that this failure has existed much longer than just during the bankrupcy.  (Quoted, "Mike had to fight way to hard
		    to get the very basic things for his team since day 1.")

	Solution:  The most difficult of the three to sell.  I think the ONLY hope would be for him to regain trust and respect for senior management. Senior
		   management would need to sitt with him and LISTEN to his issues!!!!

Mike:	Issues:   1. He wants out!!!!!!!!!!

Support KidSave and Help Miracles Happen. Every Summer.
 
Kidsave's  Summer Miracles Program enables orphanage children ages 5 to 11 to travel to the  US and Canada, live with families and attend day camp. The program gives  families who may be concerned about the problems of adopting an older child a  chance to meet, get to know and in the best-case scenario, fall in love with a  child. The program gives prospective parents an opportunity to see and evaluate  first-hand the challenges and rewards of adopting an older  child.
 
In 1999 and  2000 Kidsave and adoption agency partners placed 432 children - 96 percent of  children who participated in the program. Generally, 85 to 90 percent of  children who participate in the program find homes easily through the program.  The remaining 10 to 15 percent require more work.
 
Kidsave  believes every child deserves a family. We are committed to placing all children  who participate in the Summer Miracles Program in permanent families or  family-like environments.
 
We are looking  for families to host children, and for others who want to help us make the camp  program happen for these 250 children.   As a non-profit organization, Kidsave depends on donations to raise the  money to bring these children here and find them families.  Please call Tonya Hoppe at 281.286.8948  or tonya@tonya.cc to get involved in Houston's  Kidsave program.   


Enron and Kidventure Camps are proud to bring you Camp Enron Summer 2001.  Celebrating our third year, Camp Enron  will once again be providing summer camp for children, ages 5-13, of Enron employees and contractors. 

This year, camp will be May 29-August 10.  Ten, one-week sessions will be  available and families may choose to attend any or all sessions.  Each camp week is Monday through Friday. 

The cost is $150 per week and includes all transportation, field trips and activities.  A deposit of $50 per week is all that is needed to reserve your sessions.  

To register, log on to: http://www.kidventurecamp.com/camp_enron.htm.   Spaces are limited.

Enron parents simply ride to work with  their children and check them in to the Energizer room in the morning with the Camp Enron Team.  Enron Campers are loaded on Coach USA Buses and transported to our nearby camp. At the end of the day campers are brought back to the Energizer for parents to check out.  

It's that easy!
