BL,

Have you experienced any blackouts yet?  I think you'll see a lot this summer.
What does everyone think about the situation?  Do they think it's a threat or 
not?  I think
the state is in for a horrific summer - I hope it doesn't turn out that way, 
but it'll be incredibly
difficult to avoid.

Hope everything's going well with work and with the family.  When's the next 
time you'll
be in Dallas?  Let me know.

I'm not looking for another rotation.  I will be staying in NG trading and 
will hopefully be 
getting promoted this PRC session.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
spend the
time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
The only
problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
weekend.  Let
me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.

Stamos, 

Glad everyone had a good time at Sweets'.  I hope he had a blast.

In terms of your email reply,
you can have Calpine.  How are they going to make money long term if price 
caps are instituted?  This obviously would be the stupidest policy.  In 
addition
their exposure to the CA crisis must be pretty significant - when and how are 
they
going to get paid?  I wouldn't want to bank on the energy market in the most 
regulated state in the country.  Plus, if the state backs energy purchases, 
it's 
going to get to the point where who wants to own CA credit??  PG&E and Edison
International are doomed, as they should be.  The state of CA is going to go
down the tubes unless they find some good leadership.  Unfortunately, noone
out there seems to have the least clue on how to solve the problem.  The 
politicians
are a complete joke.  It is incredibly disheartening to witness the absolute 
stupidity
of the CA politicians in addressing this issue.  They seem to be much more 
focused 
on finger pointing than coming up with a viable solution.  I honestly think 
they are incable
of solving the problem.

Alberto,

You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
interested in trading, it's probably the best
way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
long term interest in trading or if you're just
looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
you with some insight into the area.

Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
me first if you'd like.

Kevin

You gotta get more current jokes.  That one's been floating around for quite 
some
time now.  How's everything in SF?  Have you moved into your new office?

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?
He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was
wondering how
the citizens of California viewed him.

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Kevin

The one thing I remember is that they are incredibly expensive and somewhat 
troublesome
to maintain.  Depending on how old it is, I definitely  wouldn't recommend it 
as your primary car.

Hope you had a good time at the wedding.  It was one of the best weekends 
I've had in ages.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Congratulations!!

I couldn't be happier for you two.  How's Rena feeling - probably relieved, 
huh?
Thanks for the call with the news.  We were out for the day, that's why 
didn't get back
to you.  I'll try you today.

Kevin

P.S.  Great Name

Rebecca,

I was promoted to Manager this past PRC.  Please let me know whether or not 
you received notice.
I want to make sure the files have been updated appropriately.

Thanks,

That would be great.  Let me know so I could get tix to a ballgame if the 
Astros are in town that weekend.
I'm going to the game next Monday to see McGwire and the Cards.  Glad to hear 
everything's going well.

I got a call from Peremes on Saturday.  She heard I got engaged and was 
pissed I didn't tell her.  I think she's
smoking serious crack 'cause I told her when I talked to her about 6 mos. 
ago.  I guess she just chose to ignore
me as usual.

Talk to you soon.

KR

P.S.  We just closed on a house this past Friday.  It's in need of some 
serious work.  Hopefully it'll be
habitable by the time you see it.

Correction,  I don't think thinks will blow over this summer, I think things 
could blow
up and actually be a lot worse than they are now.  In terms of longer term, I 
think
a lot depends on how the state tries to resolve the problem.  It will be 
interesting to
see.  I feel that the summer will be very interesting, especially if 
California gets the
kind of heat they had last summer.  Stay in touch.

Susan,

Could you please provide me with copies of the attached contracts.  I think 
you received a similar

your help.

Kevin

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians,

My bro' was supposed to get in touch with you.  The trip will be on Friday, 
the 22nd.  It's the day
before the wedding.  I hope you could go.  Could you please give Coun, 
Ricigs, and Sweets a call
to see if they have any interest.  Let me know.

Hope everything is going well.

That state will never be the same.  My prediction is that the state will be
bankrupt within the next 2 years unless the Federal Gov't bails it out.  I 
hope
Lowery has held off on buying his house.

Talk to you this weekend.  I blew off the Montana trip so I'll be home.

I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.

Hugs and Kisses,

Kevin.

P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.

Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is 
working for Johnson Controls.
It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for 
about 5 months.  I love my
new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and 
Michigan.  Things have been 
incredibly busy.

The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, 
the stress of planning 
combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a 
wedding with only our folks 
there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money 
toward a house and save
a lot of anger, frustration and stress.

How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears 
games?  The Scarlet Knights
have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth.

Let's talk soon.

Kevin

You're correct, Enron doesn't get too involved in these conventions.  I don't 
know 
why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
does.   My desk
seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
relied, more than
any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
business.  Probably
not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
sometime within the 
next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
we'll go get 
a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
into some
good red meat.

TJ,

Thanks for the congratulatory message you left on our voicemail - it made us 
feel great.
We actually didn't go on a honeymoon - we will take one sometime next year.  
We've just
been swamped with the house we recently bought.  We bought an old small 
bungalow
in the city.  What a money pit.  Hope everything is going great.  Tell 
everyone we said
hi.

Thanks again,

Kevin

Bri,

What's the deal with this Gray Davis guy?  What's your opinion on him?  He's
pretty much out to lunch on this whole energy crisis thing.  I was wondering 
how
the citizens of California viewed him.  

Hope everything is going well with Kim, Kendall and yourself.  Talk to you 
soon.
Send an updated picture if you have one.

Luke's growing like crazy.  Great to see the update.  Yeah,   the wedding is 
getting near and
the plans are pretty much complete.  We're really just having family so the 
plans at this point are minimum.

How's everything in California.  Is Lowery showing up on your doorstep every 
Sunday at dinner time?  I wouldn't
be surprised.

Did I tell you about the dinner I attended in NY a month ago.  What an 
event.  The party included - get this crew - 
Bill Ricigliano, Dan Sweetser, Jonathan Counnnn, Richie Moller, Brian Sh., 
and yes, Vincent Lima.  We were
all privey to Moller drinking a 12 oz. glass of fresh piss.  Some things 
never change.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Sorry it's taken me so long to reply, but I just checked my email.  We were 
out of town the
last few days.  It sounds like you've been doing a lot of thinking and 
reflecting.   I think it healthy
to analyze one's actions in order to better understand oneself.  This better 
understanding, I find,
typically leads to self improvement and greater control, and ultimately, more 
happiness in life.
However, do not let it lead to any form of regret - that would be unfair.  We 
all have regrets, but
these regretted actions typically make us stronger and better people in the 
long run.  

I forwarded your email to Patty Kampmann, not Patti Campi.  As you might 
imagine, I got a kick
out of that.

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Great to hear from you.  Looking forward to meeting in Houston for a baseball 
game.
Conway will be in Corpis soon so we should be able to do a weekend.  We 
should start
construction on the house in May - what an incredibly long process it is.  I 
definitely would
not do it if I had to do it over again.  One redeeming factor is that we 
bought on a good 
block.  We definitely have the ugliest house on the block.  We should get a 
pop in real
estate also when all the California companies start migrating to Texas.  

Joking aside, unless you guys have incredibly mild weather this summer 
combined with
a lot of rainfall, you're summer will suck.  There is no doubt that the CA 
economy is going
to suffer a great recession.  You have a shortage of supply so the only way 
to ease the
problem is to reduce demand.  This usually occurs when prices reach levels 
where the price
sensitive buyers cut back.  However, with your boy Grey Davis pushing for  
price caps, this won't
happen.   The next way for demand to be trimmed is for companies to leave, so 
this will probably
need to happen to an extent for the problem to ease.  The other factor, of 
course, is that you
could have an increase in supply - new power plants.  But being that the amt. 
of time it takes to 
develop and build a power plant in CA is about 3 times as long as in most 
other states combined
with the fact that CA hasn't had a new power plant in the last 10 years, an 
increase in supply
doesn't seem likely in the short term.  Again, this is only my opinion, so 
you could take it with
a grain of salt.  

Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Please forward this on to Mike and Kevin.  The turnaround time is rather
quick so you probably should contact this person directly to tell him that
you will be coming and sending a check to the address referenced in the
invitation.  Just tell him that you received the invitation from Kara Kinder
Howes (my cousin) and David Kinder.  Kara is one of the hosts of the event.

Of course, after you assemble the chair.

T.J.,

I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it.
How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the 
holidays or staying in LA?

Also,  if you have Lowery's address and phone # could you forward it.

Thanks,

I didn't call you this weekend.  Send me your home # so I can give you a ring.

By the way, Happy 35th birthday.  I hope you had a good one.

Good to hear from you.  The name of the jeweler is William Crescent and his 
phone
number is (708) 418-5075.  He is located in Lansing IL and his address is 
18049 Torrence Ave
Lansing, IL  60438

Let him know I recommended him and if he doesn't remember me tell him I was 
referred
by Greg Penmann and Mike Curry.  They both bought their engagement rings from 
Bill.

He's a pretty cool guy so just tell him what your looking for in terms of 
cut, clarity, color,
and carat.  He'll receive a number of stones that fit your description and 
describe them
over the phone.  He should encourage you to shop his prices.  I found him to 
be very
competitive.  Let me know how it goes.

Are you available to meet next Tuesday afternoon around 4pm.  Let me know.

Kevin

Stacy,

Kevin Ruscitti has requested a secondary firm ANR ML7 phy gas product for 
EOL.  I have located some language that you and Dale worked on back in May of 
2000.  Please let me know if this language will be OK for our needs.  Also, 
will the current GTC for Phy gas need to be revised in any way?

Thanks,

CW

A US Gas Transaction with Enron North America Corp., under which Seller shall 
sell and Buyer shall purchase a quantity of natural gas equal to the Daily 
Contract Quantity at the Contract Price on a secondary firm basis. The 
Contract Price shall be as submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The 
Period of Delivery shall be from the Effective Date through the Termination 
Date.
The term of the Transaction shall correspond to the date(s) set forth in the 
Product description on the Website.
The transaction is for delivery at the ANR Pipeline Company ML7 
interconnect.  The volumes scheduled to be delivered are subject to 
reductions due to normal operational constraints on the ANR  Pipeline Company 
pipelines based upon historical operating conditions.  The reductions caused 
by these constraints are excused nonperformance and are not considered a 
failure to receive or deliver firm gas.  In the event that the volumes 
scheduled are reduced due to such normal operational constraints, Buyer may 
designate a secondary firm delivery location.
The price is quoted in US Dollars per unit of volume, which will be the 
Contractual Currency.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted shall be millions of 
British thermal units and the quantity shown shall be in millions of BTUs per 
day.

The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any 
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that 
the problem will come and go 
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the 
situation.  I have no idea what 
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are 
at their highest level in the last 
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the 
market -  who would've thought 
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are 
also a lot of intangibles associated 
with home ownership as your aware of.   

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast 
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim 
and Kendall I said hi.

Chump!
This energy crisis is making me question  my timing on buying a house.  I'm
thinking if the economy tanks the housing prices will dip a little.  They
just crack the highs of 1989 this last two years.  Any opinions?

I start my Texas travel in February.  I'll be in Dallas for the first full
week and back in March in Dallas again.  Starting the end of March I'll be
there almost every week for about 6 months.  You'll be seeing more of me than
you want.  When we get closer to March I'll give you a buzz to set up some
dates.
Sorry about the Kendall picture, I'll try again.

Take care, B

Counnnnnnnnn,

What's up?   I heard Conway emailed you the other day about New Orleans.  I'm 
going to 
meet Conway and Jughead in N.O. on Nov 17 - 19 for a weekend getaway.  I just 
booked
my flight a couple days ago and wanted to see if there was any way you could 
make it
down.  It seems Conway has gotten a cheap hotel room with his military 
discount - one of the
perks of working for Uncle Sam.  I'm sorry for the short notice but we just 
decided to do it a 
few days ago.  If you could make it, we'd all love to see you.  If not, we'll 
have to get together
when I'm in NJ over Christmas.  Tell Chris we said hi.  Hope everything is 
going great for the
both of you.  Talk to you soon.

Kevin

Jen,

Great to hear from you.  Early congrats on your graduation.  Everything has 
been
going well down in the Lone Star State.  I got married in September down the 
Jersey
shore and everything has been going well.  We bought a house back in May.  It 
needs
an incredible amount of work.  We own the ugliest house on the block, by far.

How are things in Indiana?  Are you and Paul still together?  How is he 
doing?  When
is the last time you were back in Jersey?  We went back over Christmas but 
only for
a couple days.  I think next year we'll go back during New Year's instead of 
Christmas.
If you ever get near Texas or pass through Houston, please give us a call.  
You both
are always welcome to stay at our house.  My phone # is (713) 880-4157.  My 
work
# is (713) 853-6320.  Hope to hear from you soon.

Kevin

Subject: Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center garage will be opening very soon.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new 
building and currently park in the Allen Center or Met garages are being 
offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the 
new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The 
cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is 
currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly 
employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to 
the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made 
as spaces become available. 

The Saturn Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be 
opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street 
level entrance to Enron Center North until Saturn Ring access is available. 
Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an 
exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to 
Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your 
email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and 
receive a parking transponder along with a new information packet for the new 
garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and 
Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions. 

(You must enter & exit on Clay St. the first two weeks, also pedestrians, 
will have to use the garage stairwell located on the corner of Bell & Smith.)

Great to hear from you as always.  It'll be great to have you 
back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys.
I hope it comes across OK.

Talk to you soon.

Mr. B. Lowery,

First of all, you sent me a picture with the head cut off.  I couldn't even 
see Kendall.
I don't know if something happened with the translation of the file, but try 
to send
it again if you can.  

In regards to California's energy crisis, I think that California is screwed 
- big time.
I think it has the potential to cripple the state's economy.  If, like you 
said, noone 
really talks about it much in SoCal, I would bet that will change soon.  It 
has the potential
to affect every person in the state.  Not only will consumers end up bailing 
out the
utilities - SoCal Edison, San Diego, Gas and Electric, PG&E - but it will 
likely prevent
many new companies from setting up shop in California.  After all, who would 
want
to put millions of dollars in an operation that will be subject to power 
interruptions 
while paying the highest utility bills in the country.  I think that the only 
way California
will come out of this OK, is if it has the least energy intensive weather for 
the foreseeable
future.  I don't think this is a problem that will be resolved within the 
next couple years.
But remember, that is just my meaningless opinion.

When do you start coming to Texas.  Let me know so we can try to hook up.  
I'll talk to
you soon.  

Kevin

one.  I heard
there were some decent ones.  How's life at Duke been?  I haven't talked to 
you much

You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
poorly.  I often look back 
with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
not to mention
his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
compared to x-Philly
and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
not Ivan will elect
to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.

On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
It's a fixer-upper.
All our weekends are spent working on it.

I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
in your world.  Tell
Rina and the kids we said hi.

Sounds great.  Moller's email address is Richard.J.Moller@marshmc.com.  I do 
not have anyone else's email,
but Moller should be able to provide you with Coun's and Ricigiliano's.  Just 
ask him.  Let me know if you need anything

Hey bro

What is happening?! Fishing stuff is coming along. The charter is set for
Sept. 22nd in the A.M. departing from point pleasant. Capt. Gene will get
back to me in a week or so with more details.

The cost is $50 per person. No bottles allowed but you can bring cans or
cups. I've got the beer and drinks. Also pack food. Trip should be about 8
hours.

Contacted Rich Moeller and let him know about the time and specifics. It
looks like 14 people are going with the possibility of about 20 (5 are still
undecided). Should be a good time.

If you have some e-mail addresses for Rich or Rosigliano or a couple of
other people please supply them to me so I can keep everyone posted on the
details.

The big date is less than 4 weeks away (Can you believe it?)

Hope all is well,

Keith

Dave,

It was great getting a chance to finanlly meet the other night.  Hope you 
enjoyed dinner.

Since then, I've been thinking abt some of our conversation re: the PBR.  I 
have a quick
question - why wouldn't you under withdraw in Feb and over withdraw in Mar if 
Mar is currently
higher than Feb.  You could lock this in by buying Mar forward.  Also,  what 
happens if you
withdraw in Mar and the Summer peaks higher than what you withdrew at?  How 
is this accounted
for?

I'll talk to you after you get back from Houston.

Kevin

Thanks for the picture.  I'm glad you guys like the gift.  Luke looks just 
like Rena, huh?

As far as Ricigs goes, I don't have his phone # or address.  I think Moller 
does though.
Let me know  if you need his #.  Take care and tell Rena and Luke we said hi.

Easter was great, how 'bout yours.  It was just me, Lisa and a friend of mine.
How's everything been with you?  How are the wedding plans coming?  Have
you seen Bruce lately?  How 'bout my brother?

They appear to have made the changes that we requested.  Do you want me to 
fill in the name of the Seller and print off 2 originals for signature.  If 
not, please fill in the name and forward to me for initialling before the 
contract is signed by ENA..

We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
upgrade to
the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
need to move
out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
besides this we
don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
hours on Sunday.

Let me know what you want to do.

by Vector.

Kevin,
 As we discussed, here are the changes I feel need to be made to the form 
before Enron North America Corp.  can agree to use it.

1.  Change 1.1 to read as follows:  This Agreement shall be effective upon 
its execution and shall continue in full force and effect through December 
31, 2000.

2.  Change 3.1 to read as follows:  Upon not less than 36 hours advance 
notification by Vector, Seller shall be obligated to sell and deliver to 
Vector, and Vector shall be obligated to purchase and receive from Seller, at 
the time stipulated by Vector in the advance written notification, at a Point 
of Sale, a quantity of gas equal to Seller's PSQ for such Point of Sale, as 
specified in Exhibit A to this Agreement.  The parties agree that time is of 
the essence in this Agreement..

3.  Add 4.2 to read as follows:  4.2  If Vector fails to purchase and receive 
from Seller the quantity of gas required to be purchased and received by it 
under Article 3.1 for any reason other than the occurrence of an event of 
Force Majeure, Vector shall indemnify Seller and shall be liable to pay 
Seller an amount equal to the difference between the price that would have 
been paid to Seller and the Gas Daily low price, set forth in Gas Daily under 
the heading "Daily Price Survey" under the listing applicable to Chicago and 
using the low price in the range of prices published for the day that Vector 
failed to perform multiplied by the volume Vector failed to purchase and 
receive from Seller for such day.

4.  Add the following language at the end of 9.1.  For breach of any 
provision for which an express remedy or measure of damages is herein 
provided, such express remedy or measure of damages shall be the sole and 
exclusive remedy hereunder.  If no remedy or measure of damages is expressly 
herein provided, the obligor's liability shall be limited to direct actual 
damages only, such direct actual damages shall be the sole and exclusive 
remedy hereunder and all other remedies or damages at law or in equity are 
waived.  Unless expressly herein provided, neither party shall be liable for 
consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or indirect damages, lost 
profits or other business interruption damages, in tort, contract, under any 
indemnity provision or otherwise.

5.  Add the following Seller's information in 10.1.
 Enron North America Corp.
 P. O. Box 4428
 Houston, Texas 77210-4428
 Attn:  Documentation and Deal Clearing Desk
 Facsimile No. (713) 646-4816.

Stamos,

I don't think many buying opportunities out there.   The economy is going to 
get 
crushed this year.  There's only one place to put one's money now, and that 
is in cash.
The manufacturing sector is in dire straits and you will continue to see an 
increase in
plant shutdowns and company layoffs.  The Fed could continue to lower rates 
but there'll
be little capital investment if consumer spending dries up.  I feel we've 
just seen the beginning.  
I think the Dow will be trading under 8000 by the end of April.

Psychologically, the California crisis will add to consumer fear.  The crisis 
is not a short term
problem.  As a result, barring any Federal bailout, you could kiss that 
state's economy goodbye.
Let me ask you a question; if you were paying (1) the highest real estate 
prices in the country, and 
(2) the highest energy prices for the least reliable power, in (3) the midst 
of a hi-tech meltdown, what would
keep you or your company from closing shop and moving to a different state??  
If you own any
CA real estate, sell.  The only way to solve the CA energy crisis is to 
reduce demand or increase supply.
Since CA doesn't want any power plants in its backyard, the supply issue 
likely won't be solved anytime
soon.  So, how do impact demand??  You have to price energy(power/gas) so 
high that
the discretionary user (household, manufacturer, commercial store) conserves 
by closing its plant, cutting
back on the thermastat or running the commercial operation during off-peak 
hours.  California will see
this reduction in demand over time.  If the blackouts subside it's because so 
many businesses have
closed their doors for good or moved to another state.  Without this, the 
blackouts will get much worse.
If the state tries to get into the business of buying and selling electricity 
and gas, I would bet it will go
bankrupt within 2-3 yrs.  Could you imagine the impact on the national 
economy from the bankruptcy 
of the U.S.'s most prosperous state.  Obviously this is only my opinion, but 
I would keep my eyes on
the energy markets - that's where the key to the turnaround lies.  Take Care 
and thanks for the email.

Congrats Murli,

Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you.  I'm glad you accepted a job 
at Enron.
I know you'll enjoy it.  As far as ECI goes, what group is this?  Is this the 
Communications
group?  I would not recommend EES however.  I think you're experience would 
be better
at ECT (now ENA) or Enron Communications.   Give me a call at 713-853-6320 
(W) and
we can talk.  Also I'm still in an apt so I don't know any real estate 
brokers to refer you to.

Talk to you soon.

didn't want to recommend a third at this time.  I told him that if anything

Chump,

Long time no hear.  Sorry it's taken me so long to touch base with you.  
Between work, the wedding,
and the fact that we just purchased a house (pending inspections) I've been 
pretty stressed.
As far as the wedding goes Lisa and I have decided to scale down 
considerably.  We're only going
to have immediately family and the folks in the wedding party.  For me that 
includes you of course, Moller,
Kampy and Peremes (even though she won't be in the wedding).  Don't tell her 
though, she's the only
one I haven't mentioned anything to.  I'll make sure you and Moller get to 
share a room.  I feel kinda bad
about not inviting Lowery since I was in his wedding, but I don't feel like 
dealing with Kim.  She's really 
annoyed me the last few times I've seen her.

We still plan on having it at the B&B in Long Beach Island.  We'll have a 
catered dinner for about 45 folks.
It should be more manageable and cheaper this way.

Do you have the exact date when you'll move back to the states?  I'm psyched 
you'll be a lot closer.  You
could swing over to Houston and check out the new house.  By that time we 
should have it in decent shape.
We bought the ugliest, most beat-up house on the block.  It definitely needs 
a lot of work.  We'll be busy for
the next year working on it.  I think when it's done,  it'll look pretty cool.

Anyway,  send me an email and let me know how everything's going and when 
you'll be back.  Take care and
tell Marie we said hi.

Kevin

Cherly,

I have been promoted out of the Associate program last PRC.  As a result, if 
you could take me off the Analyst/
Associate distribution list I'd deeply appreciate it.  Thanks and let me know 
if you have any questions or if you
haven't been notified of the promotion.

Thanks for the gift certificate. You shouldn't have done that.  I'm heading

The following article appeared in today's Chronicle.

Enron rating setup irks many workers 
By L.M. SIXEL 

TONGUES ARE WAGGING at Enron Corp., and it's not because of the bonuses 
they're expecting next month. 

Employees are irate about a new performance-review ranking system that pits 
them against each other. 

Under the system, nicknamed "rank and yank," employees will be put in one of 
five categories: 5 percent will be identified as "superior," 30 percent will 
be labeled "excellent," 30 percent will be called "strong," 20 percent will 
be labeled "satisfactory" and 15 percent will be called "needs improvement" 
or "issues." 

An insider said "needs improvement" means "you have one leg hanging out the 
window." And "issues" is Enron lingo for "you're gone." 

The rankings, whose names reportedly took Enron officials hours to come up 
with, are not based just on performance. 

Instead, they compare employee against employee. 

"It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher 
level compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current 
period if other employees' performance raised the bar," according to a memo 
from Chief of Staff Steven Kean and Executive Vice President Cindy Olson that 
was distributed this month. 

While employees are competing against each other for ratings, they're also 
expected to be team players, according to the memo. 


`Horse-trading' of rank denied
The problem, according to someone familiar with the new system, is the 
horse-trading that goes on when the rankings are divided up. 

Managers trade rankings like baseball cards, explained the insider, offering 
to downgrade one employee if they can get a better rating for another 
employee. 

An employee's ranking is more a function of the negotiating skills of the 
manager he is working for, the insider said. 

Olson, who's over human resources and community relations, said no 
horsetrading is going on. The rankings, due out this week, aren't set in 
stone, she said. Only 9 percent of employees were rated in the bottom 
category while 6 to 7 percent were labeled superior, she said. 

But Olson said she can see how employees might be worried about the prospect 
of bargaining. 

She speculated that one reason employees might worry is because it's a new 
system for about 60 percent of Enron's employees. In years past, only the 
wholesale energy services group was ranked this way. 

Some human resource managers expressed surprise that Enron, which is known 
for hiring superstars, apparently feels that it must get rid of so many 
employees -- or at least put them on notice that they're not doing well. 

It doesn't say much about the confidence of your recruiting system if you're 
getting rid of 10 to 15 percent of your work force each year, said a human 
resource manager in Houston who asked to remain anonymous. 


Some may not fit in
Some people, as smart and talented as they are, just don't fit into Enron's 
culture, Olson said. It's a company that doesn't tell people what to do; you 
have to know what adds value, she said. Some folks just have a hard time in 
that environment. 

After thinking about it for a moment, Olson added that maybe Enron's 
recruiters aren't doing a good enough job weeding out the people who wouldn't 
do well in an entrepreneurial environment. 

Forced ranking systems were popular several years ago. But they fell out of 
favor, in part because they were seen as damaging employee motivation. 

Several years ago, Houston Lighting & Power put in a forced ranking system, 
dividing all employees into four groups, with "1" the top group and "4" the 
lowest. Employees were so angry with the system that some work crews had 
T-shirts printed: "Don't ask me -- I'm a 3." 

Olson said she doesn't see a problem with motivation. People like to know how 
they stand and will work hard to reach the top category, she said. 

But many of the employees -- at least the ones who rate above satisfactory -- 
won't know how they're rated. Managers don't have to reveal the ratings. 

And as for figuring out what it takes to be superior? You've got to reinvent 
your job, add new business lines or create something totally new. 

"Employees understand that when it's explained to them," Olson said.
