Jeff and Bob, 

At Tradition's request, I put together a one-page explanation of CAISO Firm 
Energy.  I thought you might find it handy to have it to hand when discussing 
this with counterparties.

Here is the explanation for CAISO Firm Energy.  As discussed, if asked, 
please tell people that it was prepared by a market participant at 
Tradition's request.  I'd rather keep Enron's name out of it.

Thank you in advance for helping us with this.

  Market Participants:

  On August 1, 2000, the ISO Board of Governors approved a
proposal to conduct a competitive solicitation to procure guaranteed
generation service during natural gas curtailments in the Los Angeles Basin.
Since the service must in place by December 1, 2000, and the ISO expects
this service to be provided by existing generation, the ISO needs to have
responses by October 6, 2000.  ISO staff is preparing the materials for the
solicitation and expects to release those materials in the next few weeks.
We expect final approval of a response by the Board of Governors during the
week of October 23, 2000.

  This note will allow potential respondents to begin
preparing your response in advance of the release of the solicitation.

  The Board memo and presentation regarding this solicitation,
which include the proposed principles of the solicitation, can be found at
http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/27/2000072714421515747.html
<http://www.caiso.com/docs/2000/07/27/2000072714421515747.html> .

  We will notify you again when the materials are ready.  If
you have any questions, please contact Brian Theaker at (916) 608-5804, or

 *DJ Calif Assembly Delays SDG&E Rate Roll-Back Vote To Thu

 Question About Who Will Pay Elec Bills

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--The California State Assembly has postponed until
Thursday
 a vote on restoring electricity rates for customers of San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. to
 pre-deregulation levels, according to a spokesman for Assemblywoman Susan
Davis
 (D-San Diego), who is sponsoring the bill.

 The bill was sent to the assembly's appropriations committee because some
 representatives are concerned about who - if not SDG&E customers - will pay
for
 electricity in the city this summer and past spring. The difference between
what SDG&E
 customers would pay under the legislation and what SDG&E is paying for
supplies in
 the skyrocketing electricity markets has been estimated at $1.5 billion.

 Assembly Passage Of Measure Uncertain

 The legislation would roll back electricity rates to June 1, 1999, levels
for customers of
 SDG&E, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE). This spring and summer, the utility's
 customers have received electricity bills that are nearly triple what they
were last year.

 Electricity rates for the state's other utilities haven't been deregulated
yet, so their
 customers are receiving fixed prices per kilowatt-hour of power used.

 Prospects for passage of the bill, AB 2290, are unclear in the Assembly.
The California
 State Senate passed the bill unanimously last week. But it would need 54
votes to pass
 through the 80-member Assembly before Gov. Gray Davis could consider
signing it into
 law.

 If all 47 Democrats approve the measure, it would need at least seven
Republican votes
 to pass. But, as reported Tuesday, only three Republican lawmakers said
they would
 support the bill.

 The rollback would provide some economic relief to SDG&E's 1.1 million
customers,
 who have been paying market-based rates for electricity since June. If the
rollback is
 approved, utility bills for residential customers would be about $55 to $60
a month,
 according to SDG&E.

 Steve Maviglio, press secretary to Davis, said the governor hasn't decided
whether he
 would sign the bill into law if approved.

 Monday, the state's Public Utilities Commission rejected a proposal to roll
back rates,
 instead approving a stabilization rate plan that would reduce the cost of
electricity to
 about $68 a month for residential customers who conserve usage.

Some power development companies think the answer to electric price
volatility is blowin' in the wind, literally, moving to develop compessed
air energy storage facilities in a number of locations. Local utilities seem
encouraged by the idea as well. Read details at http://www.einsight.com.

In Energy Insight 2000 (Red Banner, premium-pay access only)
Montana Power's Touch America unit is expanding into wireless even as it
installs fiber optics across the country. The analysis is timely given
Montana Power's asset sale and Deutsche Telecom's further U.S. expansion,
both announced Monday.

News Briefs:

+Montana Power Sells Oil and Gas Business Unit
The Montana Power Co. has sold for $475million (US) its nonregulated oil and
gas business unit to PanCanadian Petroleum Limited of Calgary. The sale
includes subsidiaries that have interests in crude oil, natural gas and gas
liquids exploration, production and marketing in the U.S. and Canada.

Proceeds from the sale would be invested in growing Touch America, MPC's
national fiber-optic and wireless broadband telecommunications subsidiary.
The U.S. businesses have operations in northern Montana and in the D-J
(Denver-Julesburg) Basin north of Denver as well as minor properties in the
Anadarko Basin, Oklahoma, and Green River Basin, Wyoming. Fractionation
plants are at Cut Bank, MT, and Ft. Lupton, CO. The Canadian properties
reside mostly in southern and central Alberta and in southern Saskatchewan.

***********
+Deutsche Telekom to Buy Powertel for $5.89bn
The Financial Times said that Deutsche Telekom is expanding in the U.S.
mobile phone market by acquiring Powertel, a local mobile operator in the
Southeast, for about $5.89 billion in shares. The deal comes just weeks
after DT moved into the U.S. mobile market through the $50 billion
acquisition of VoiceStream.

As that deal has not yet been completed, the latest transaction is
structured as an all-share acquisition of Powertel by Voicestream. The two
U.S. companies have also agreed that the deal will go ahead even if DT's
takeover of VoiceStream is not completed.

Communications Holdings, Inc., a unit of SCANA Corp., owns approximately
14.6 million fully diluted
common shares, or about a 27% equity interest, in Powertel, representing an
investment of $249 million.

Subject: ISO To Participate in Super Peak Market



Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

News Brief:
+TXU Europe puts gas assets up for sale
FT Energy's Gas Daily Europe reports that TXU Europe is putting its North
Sea gas assets up for sale. The utility confirmed today that is in
"preliminary talks" with a number of third parties, but stressed it was
"very early days". The move follows "a number of unsolicited expressions of
interests" in the business, including its operatorship. TXU said it is
reviewing this part of its business and will only decide whether to sell at
its conclusion. It has not set a deadline for the review.

A source inside the company was not surprised at the review: "The business
has changed a lot in the last year." TXU has already put up its UK
generation assets for sale, and this latest move to divest gas assets could
mark a shift in strategy to focus on trading and retailing. Some analysts
believe that assets no longer give "competitive advantage" to energy
companies, as the focus shifts towards the end-user and convergence of gas
and electricity.

TXU's principal production assets comprise the operating licence and 64.2%
of the 83bn ft? Johnston gas field, plus 14.75% of the 33bn ft? Ravenspurn
North field, 11.24% of the 5bn ft? Welland field and 4.83% of the 17bn ft?
Schooner field. It also has a number of upstream exploration licences and
interests in pipelines.

This Market Notification serves to advise you of the posting of the
Retro-Active November 16th - 30th 1999 UFE Market Adjustments resulting from
the ISO 1999 UFE Project results.  The June 20, 2000 Preliminary Settlement
Statement (PSS) contains the appropriate retro-active charge type
adjustments, specific to each participating SC.

This is the Seventh of Nine retro-active UFE adjustment to be processed, to
correct the UFE related settlement quality meter data (SQMD) problems
experienced commencing August 21st 1999 in the PG&E UDC Service Area, which
continued through December 31, 1999.

A copy of this ISO Project's final Report was previously distributed on June
15, 2000.

The UFE related market adjustments are reflected in Charge Types (CT)
111,112,114,115,116,402,403, 406, 1010,1011, 1030,1210.  GMC (CT 351) will
also be reconciled for those SC's which reported revised load, consistent
with any resubmitted UFE Project meter data.

The ISO will continue to monitor system UFE on a regular basis, conduct
periodic meter data audits, work with Market participants to help assure
SQMD,  and address any issues which arise.  Once again, our appreciation for
the Market's assistance to help assure an accurate UFE Market settlement and
for submission of SQMD!

Further to your letter to us (addressed to Mr. Tim Belden)  dated August 14, 
2000:  

Enron thinks that the elimination of physical risk during the month of August 
will be of commercial benefit because Enron expects that during the month of 
August there will be transmission line derations affecting the hour ahead 
market which will lead to TO debit charges by the CAISO.   The elimination 
of  TO debit charges is a commercial benefit to Enron.

 DJ Clinton To Direct Govt To Help Calif On Electricity Woes

 WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. President Bill Clinton will direct federal
agencies
 Wednesday to provide financial assistance to low-income families and small
 businesses in Southern California to help them cope with high electricity
bills, the White
 House said in a written statement.

 Clinton also ordered the release of $2.6 million from the Low Income Home
Energy
 Assistance Program to help low-income families in Southern California. The
Small
 Business Administration will urge its lending partners to use SBA credit
programs to
 help small businesses with their energy costs.

 Clinton is taking the action because of a steep rise in the wholesale price
of electricity,
 the statement said.

 In addition, Clinton has called on Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to ask
the Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission to speed up an investigation into the bulk
market for
 electricity "so that state and federal regulators and policy makers can
have the
 information they need to protect consumers in a timely fashion."

 Clinton's actions marks the second time this summer the president has
stepped in to
 help California cope with its electricity shortages. Earlier, Clinton
called on all federal
 facilities in California to cut their power usage and to direct power back
into the
 electricity grid.

> Susan Davis.
>   It replaces a bill passed unanimously by the Senate on August 10 that

> meet its customers' demand.
>   Prices for those purchases, made through the state-run California Power
> Exchange and the California Independent System Operator, have been several
> times
> higher than historical norms this spring and past summer.
>   The new bill (similar to a proposal that the California Public Utilities
> Commission rejected Monday) would cap the price of electricity at 6.5
> cents a
> kilowatt-hour for residential customers and small businesses. That
> translates to
> an average residential bill of $68 a month when transmission and

> another
> major hub for deliveries to California, is at $95/MWh or 9.5 cents/kWh. In
> 2002,

> retail
> price and the 9.5-cent wholesale market price? That difference over a
> three-year
> period has been estimated to be $1.5 billion for SDG&E, a unit of Sempra
> Energy
> (SRE), if current market conditions persist.
>   "There is a clause for making annual adjustments (to the retail price
> cap),
> and that's one of the things being worked on now," Maviglio said Thursday.

FYI,
It has been a valiant effort but as soon as we free up space on the Notes 
server it fills back in. 
So as a result we will be shutting down the notes server tonight from 8:00 PM 
until 12:00 AM to rebuild the data drives. This will provide more space to 
work with and allow for room to grow.
We will also be turning on a purge agent in 2 weeks that will eliminate mail 
from your Inbox, Sent Mail and Trash after it reaches 30 days of age.
Please shut down Lotus Notes before you leave to night to help ensure we do 
not lose any data.

Thanks,
Mike Mc.

FYI,
We are at a point with the mail server that is going to require me to shut it 
down during the day today and perform hardware upgrades. That is unless 
everyone and I mean everyone goes through their mail and cleans out the sent 
mail, inbox and trash folders. If this is not done soon then mail will stop 
functioning all together.
I would prefer to upgrade the hardware in the evening but this will take 
several hours.

So please help out by cleaning house on your mail, otherwise we will be 
forced to do the upgrade in the middle of the day.

Thanks,
MIke Mc.

Quantity Limits- For SCE and PG&E, previously approved BFM limitations are 
the following:
SCE 
Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and 
balance of the month BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at SCE's net short position which is a 
maximum of  
 Q1: 2,200 MW, Q2 2,200 MW, Q3: 5,200 MW, Q4: 3,000 MW
Participation ion daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to 
amounts above 1,000 MW SCE's net short position.

PG&E 
Limits for BFM products including retail energy transactions, and daily and 
balance of the month BFM products:
Retail Energy markets are limited at PG&E's net short position which is not 
disclosed. However it is reasonable to assume that it is at least 3,000 MW 
for the summer quarters given that PG&E had previously filed asking for a 
limit of 3,000 MW.
 Participation in daily and balance of the month BFM products are limited to 
amounts above 1,000 MW PG&E's net short position.

SDG&E BFM limits approved in Advice Letter 1234-E
Monthly and Quarterly Forward Market:  1900 MW July-September, 1700 MW all 
other months
Daily and Balance of Month quantities will not exceed 1000 MW more than the 
limits in the forward markets
Ancillary Services  will not exceed 90% of SDG&E's forecast ancillary 
services for the month or the quarter.
SDG&E's limits are ultimately limited to the load to customers under 20 kW.

The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.
For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited 
reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition 
period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the 
procurement practices on a quarterly basis. 
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E 
and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 
delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01. 
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kW
The quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the 
BFM participation spelled out in advice letter 1234-E. I do not have a copy 
of that advice letter off hand but will provide you with the information 
tomorrow.

We will provide you with more details soon.

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me.

Attached are the decision related to the above issues.

We have had some confusion recently with respect to coverage when someone is 
out of the office.  From here forward, please provide the following 
information to me via e-mail for days when you are out of the office:

Curve coverage - who is responsible for ensuring that your curves are updated 
and downloaded in an accurate and timely manner.
EOL coverage - which products need to be maintained and who will make the 
markets in your absence.

This new procedure is effective immediately!

Dear All, 

I have heard from several of you today that we continue to receive Broker 
Confirms which reference "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy" for 
deals done at California Delivery Points.  I have spoken with Bob Badeer and 
he promised me that he and Jeff are going to call them as soon as they can. 

In the meantime, if for any SP15, NP15, or Z26 deals we receive a Broker 
Confirmation with  "WSPP Schedule C" instead of "CAISO Energy", please mark 
out the former by hand and replace it with the latter. Then fax the amended 
Confirmation back to the Broker and say something in the fax Cover Sheet to 
the effect of :

"We have amended the attached Confirmation(s) to show that the relevant 
energy purchased/sold is "CAISO Energy". Please revise your Confirmation(s) 
to reflect this modification and send the amended Confirmation(s) to us and 
our Counterparty. Should you have any questions with regard to the "CAISO 
Energy" product, please contact Bob Badeer on (503) 464-3926 or Jeff Richter 
on (503) 464-3720."

Let's give Bob and Jeff some time to call the brokers and I would propose to 
reassess the situation next Monday (I am out of the office on business on 
Friday). Let's see where we are then.

Thanks everyone, 

Shari

Bob & Jeff, 

At my request, the Confirm Desk has put together a list of Brokers who 
continue to reference " West Firm" rather than "CAISO" in their Broker 
Confirmations for deals done at the California Delivery Points.  Please see 
Kim's email below. 

Could you please speak with each of them and reiterate that they must 
specifically reference "CAISO" energy in their Confirmations if that is the 
product we told them that we would buy or sell? 

Bob- I will call you later on this afternoon about Pacificorp. We got 2 more 
Confirms today with "CAISO" stricken through.

Thanks in advance guys,

Last Thursday, I made the first attached presentation to the FERC Staff at 
the power marketer's meeting on the FERC's investigation of the wholesale 
market in the West (and in particular California).  Ellen Wolf (of Tabors 
Caramanis) and I created this presentation building on previous presentations 
by Tim Belden and Dave Parquet.  In the presentation and the meeting we made 
the following points:
There isn't much FERC can do because the cause of the price spikes is not in 
the wholesale market.  We discouraged FERC from taking any action that would 
hurt the vibrant wholesale market in the California and the rest of the West 
as well.
High prices logically resulted from scarcity and if the Commission does 
anything it should (1) investigate whether market power was being exercised 
by any party and, (2) if necessary to protect the market (while still 
incenting needed generation) establish a price cap at a scarcity rent level 
equal to the price at which loads were willing to interrupt.  
The IOUs have not properly prepared for the risk of high prices caused by 
scarcity.  They have failed to hedge and have underscheduled their load, 
therefore having to fill a large percentage of their load at ISO real time 
prices.  My analogy was that this was like day trading your retirement fund 
as an asset allocation scheme.
The market would function better if more information was provided to the 
market.
The Commission should do whatever it can to incent participation by load.
To see the presentation, detach, save, and view in Powerpoint.  When you do, 
you will find there are many "hidden" slides that were not part of the oral 
presentation but were provided to Staff in hard copy for additional 
information.

According to the head of the investigation (Scott Miller), the staff got alot 
more out of this meeting than Staff's previous meetings with the IOUs and the 
generators.  Based on the numerous phone calls I've been getting, the Staff 
is looking into the data we provided.  

I have also attached a revised version of the presentation that Tim sent to 
Scott Miller on Friday.  Tim's version conveys the same message but takes a 
different approach to conveying the message.  On Friday, Tim talked to Scott 
and answered some additional questions.  Tim said that Enron is in favor of 
eliminating the mandatory PX buying requirement and would like the IOUs to be 
able to buy from Enron Online.  He also explained more fully the existence of 
scarcity .

Subject: ISO To Participate in Super Peak Market


Folks,

Late Friday afternoon Ziad called me.  The ISO Governing Board earlier
the same day turned down the ISO management's request to force SCs to
place 95% of their scheduled load in the DA market.  That leaves the ISO
little choice but to venture into the energy markets to procure power to
cover their peak hours on hot days.

Terry gave Ziad the OK to proceed with placing both the APX and
California PX screens for this new product/matching-service.  I am
working with the two vendors and the ISO to make this happen quickly.
We anticipate that the market will open on Tuesday, September 5, or
earlier.

Key people who you may need to contact:
ISO - Ziad Alaywan  916-351-2140 (Nancy Traweek and Jim McIntosh are
also in the loop)
PX - Ken Czarnecki 626-537-3123
PX - John Yurkanin 626-537-3124
APX - Denice Cazalet 408-517-2123
APX - Michael Heinrich 408-517-2159

Please feel free to contact me with your questions.  Several of you have
not had the opportunity to attend the pre-design meetings we had at the
California PX and APX a few weeks ago, nor were you aware of the joint
WPTF/ISO meeting held last week.  But in essence, what this
product/matching-service will allow you to do is post bids to sell, or
buy a 6-hour block of capacity at a firm energy price across the hours
of HE13 to HE18.  You can bid at COB, Mead, PV, SP15 or NP15.  You can
utilize either the CalPX or APX to post your bids, because the ISO will
be watching both screens.  The block sizes are (supposed to be) 25MW.
The seller is responsible for arranging transmission to the delivery
point, and the buyer (e.g., ISO) is responsible for arranging
transmission service from the delivery point.  The ISO will make its
purchase decisions for the day-of at or before 8:00 a.m.  The ISO will
send out a general notice when it needs offers to sell on the super-peak
market.  I expect that bids for either buy or sell will be able to be
posted at any time, 24 hours.  The screens should allow parties to post
buy or sell bids at least 60 days forward of the trade day.

You are not limited to a price cap in these markets, but the ISO as a
buyer has the right to not purchase at prices above it's price cap.

I think WPTF members should be very proud that we were able to quickly
work together, and with the ISO to create this market. I have no doubt
the ISO will be offering bids to purchase starting Sept 5, and going
forward 60 days.  However, who among you will be willing and able to
post bids to sell?

The draft decision rejects SDG&E's request to allocate those contracts to=

those transactions or providing an opportunity for a bid process.

Because this decision adopts the same principles in the SCE and PG&E=20

Subject: Draft Decision Issued in SDG&E Emergency Motion



ALJ Cooke has issued the attached draft decision with regard to the August =
=20
9, 2000, emergency motion filed by SDG&E to enter into bilateral power =20
contracts.? SDG&E sought similar authority to that granted to Edison  and=
=20
PG&E in D.00-08-023.? The draft decision would grant the motion,  but would=
=20
impose certain conditions different from those requested by the  utility.?=
=20
The differences are summarized below:
?
Background
Under the terms of the  Commission=01,s D.00-08-021, SDG&E is currently=20
authorized to participate  in the PX forward markets for energy services,=
=20
subject to seasonal trading  limits, through the end of the last utility ra=
te=20
freeze.? SDG&E is not  proposing an increase to the limits approved in=20
D.00-08-021 and will treat its  capacity purchases under those limits,=20
although it reserves the right to request  expanded authority in the future=
.?=20
The draft decision also notes that  SDG&E proposes that costs associated=20
with, and gains/losses from these  bilateral contracts should be attributed=
=20
only to small commercial and  residential customers.? It also notes that=20
intervenors focused on four  general areas of concern regarding the specifi=
c=20
authority requested by  SDG&E: duration of contracts, reasonableness=20
standards, request for  exemption from affiliate rules, and ratemaking.
?
Duration of  Contracts
SDG&E requested  authority to enter into bilateral contracts that expire on=
=20
or before December  31, 2005.? The ALJ notes that the Commission recently=
=20
instituted an  investigation into the impact of the functioning of the=20
wholesale electric  market on retail rates in SDG&E=01,s service territory =
and=20
that the OII  will consider whether SDG&E should be removed from that defau=
lt=20
provider  role.? The ALJ states that, "the Commission should not compromise=
 =20
future long-term solutions by affording SDG&E greater purchasing authority =
=20
than is needed to address the current emergency situation.? For this  reaso=
n,=20
we limit SDG&E=01,s authority to what we described in D.00-08-023  as near-=
term=20
bilateral contracting authority, that is, contracts with delivery  occurrin=
g=20
on or before December 31, 2002."
?
Reasonableness  Standards
The draft decision  suggests that the OII provides a forum to establish a=
=20
common framework for all  three utilities for determining the reasonablenes=
s=20
of their bilateral  purchases.? However, in the interim, it adopts the same=
=20
reasonableness  standard for near-term contracts as it did for SCE.? "If th=
e=20
average  price of SDG&E=01,s bilateral transactions, delivered or requiring=
 =20
delivery, over the course of an annual period exceeds the average price of =
=20
SDG&E=01,s corresponding portfolio of transactions, delivered or  requiring=
=20
deliver over the same period, by more than 5%, then the Commission  will=20
initiate a reasonableness review.? Reasonableness reviews, to the  extent=
=20
needed, will take place as part of SDG&E=01,s Annual Transition  Cost=20
Proceeding."
?
Affiliate Rules  Exemption
SDG&E's request to be  exempted from the affiliate rules for any purchases=
=20
from affiliates was  denied.
?
Ratemaking
TURN  urged the Commission to reject SDG&E=01,s request to limit the ratema=
king =20
impacts of the bilateral contracts to its residential and small commercial =
=20
customers, saying that, "the potential risks and benefits should be spread =
=20
among all customers."? The draft decision states that, "we do not  believe =
it=20
prudent to limit the cost exposure for these contracts solely to  residenti=
al=20
and small commercial customers.? This aspect of  SDG&E=01,s motion is denie=
d."
?
Transparency  Considerations
The ALJ orders SDG&E  to disclose all bilateral transactions to the Energy=
=20
Division on a confidential  basis in a monthly report.? The draft decision=
=20
notes that, "WPTF and  ARM argue that additional transparency of bilateral=
=20
transactions is required,  compared to that proposed by SDG&E.? We adopt=20
consistent disclosure  standards for SDG&E bilateral contracts as that=20
adopted in D.00-08-023 for  PG&E and SCE.? This issue may be revisited on a=
=20
going forward basis in  I.00-08-002."
?
Response Time
The normal response time  has been shortened.? Parties to the proceeding ma=
y=20
file comments on the  draft decision no later than noon on September 5,=20
2000.? I suggest that  comments be filed agreeing with the thrust of the=20
decision, but strongly  advocating that SDG&E be required to publicly post=
=20
its transactions, as it  agreed to do in Advice Letter 1234-E, with regard =
to=20
SDG&E's participation  in the Block Forward Market.? In addition, we should=
=20
consider whether to  refight the issue of limiting the ratemaking impacts o=
f=20
the bilateral contracts  to SDG&E's residential and small commercial=20
customers.
?
Comments or  suggestions???

News Brief

+High Cost of Oil and Natural Gas Puts FPL $518 Million Behind in Fuel
Expense Recovery

Faced with skyrocketing oil and natural gas prices and heavy seasonal demand
for electricity, Florida Power & Light Company has filed preliminary
paperwork with the Florida Public Service Commission identifying $518
million in expenses above projections for fuel burned to produce electricity
in 2000. FPL will file with the Commission in September for permission to
recover the expense in customer bills beginning Jan. 1, 2001.

Part of this increase will be offset by a refund to customers that is
currently estimated to be $75 million to $100 million. The refund is
pursuant to an agreement reached in April 1999 with the Office of the Public
Counsel and the FPSC that provides for revenue sharing between FPL and its
customers, as well as a 6% annual rate reduction for three years. As a
result of the forecasted fuel costs and the expected rebate, residential
electric rates could increase by approximately 13% per kilowatt-hour.

The cost of oil used to generate electricity has more than doubled since the
first quarter of 1999 and has not been this high since the Gulf War in 1990.
Since January 2000, oil prices have increased 44% per barrel. Natural gas
prices also have risen unabated, climbing 77% since January 2000. With the
onset of winter, natural gas prices may increase further as demand for
heating fuel increases.

        STAGE 1 EMERGENCY NOTICE [200000208]

Effective 08/26/2000 at 16:00 the California Independent System Operator
has implemented Stage 1 of the Electrical Emergency Plan. The Plan has
been implemented for the following reasons:

Lack of resources

Stage 1 is expected to be in effect from HE 15
through HE 18.

Participating transmission owners are to notify the Utility Distribution
Companies within their operational areas.

Stage 1:    Operating reserves are less than minimum. Advise the Utility
            Distribution Company of potential power shortages and request
            the UDC to advise end-use customers to reduce demand to minimum
            requirements without disruption of employment or curtailment of
            industrial production or commerce. Advise the UDC to prepare for
            imminent implementation of the interruptible load programs and/or
            electrical emergency plan.

This message is from Market Operations  at the California ISO.

Sorry about this gang, but my new computer messed up the e-mail list.
It's 4 am and I think I have fixed it.  Maybe.  Bear with me if you are

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

Everyone is getting into the act.  When I started this gig, I was the
only guy in town writing to folks like you about the power industry in
California.  I wrote about what?s new, what?s happening, and all the
important stuff.  This week, Governor Gray Davis decided to write his
own Burrito.  His epistle got more press than mine, but why is he
muscling in on my turf?  Not to be outdone, PUC President Loretta Lynch
released a report which looks into every facet of California?s power
business.  No stone left unturned. I?m telling you, there isn?t enough
room in this business for all of us.  They need to clear out.

With people like Herr (Hair?) Peace, Governor I?m-Not Mr.-Rogers Davis
and Let?s Do Lynch, who needs a Friday Burrito?  They re-define our
reality each week with mind-numbing aplomb.  For example, starting in
early June, the PX was ordered to compete for business against other
Qualified Trading Vehicles.  Then, two weeks later, the Energy F_hrer
legislated that idea to an early death which kept the status quo for at
least one year.  This week the PUC approved 5-year bilateral deals for
PG&E and SCE, thereby opening the PX to competition, and emasculating
the PX?s Block Forward Market. Zip, bam, boom.

I can?t wait to see what next week will bring.  I hear Senator Bowen is
holding Committee hearings on re regulating the industry, and the
Governor?s new Energy Security Council will meet to decide six things:

What?s for lunch?
Who will sit at the head of the table?
Does anyone have good seats for next week?s Democratic convention?
Is there anyone we haven?t indicted yet in the power industry?
Who will crank up the air conditioning in this room?  It?s getting too
warm.

Then, they will collect data from innocent businesses under subpoena,
ignore the facts, and publish a report.  It makes one want to take a
deep breath, and inhale the scented fumes of democracy.

You know, I can?t think about where to begin, so let?s start somewhere.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ Is there anyone left at SDG&E with a brain?

Well, the answer very clearly is no.  I have been astounded by repeated
attempts of SDG&E?s most senior people to ape humans, but instead they
mimic apes.

Consider the following.  First, they waltz their default customers into
the summer with little of no protection from price spikes in the
wholesale market.  Forgivable in that it is human to err.  The prices
skyrocket in June, and they start looking for who to blame.  _Must be
them damn independent generators,O say their managers.  Gary Cotton
informs the ISO Governing Board that hedging SDG&E?s position in the
Block Forward Market wouldn?t have made any difference.  There?s one
nobel laureate who missed his prime.

Next, under pressure, they ask for help from suppliers and anyone else
who will assist the utility and their customers.  Nine offers show up at
their table, and they can?t choose any of them.  Again, Mr Cotton tells
his fellow ISO Governing Board members that these things take time, and
we don?t to rush since there are many legislative barriers, and, well,
the surfing was good this week so why spoil it?

Now they are in a panic because the Energy F_hrer is visiting old ladies
living in trailer parks, advising them not to pay their SDG&E
electricity bill, and to continue to operate their air conditioners.
SDG&E puts a full page ad in the local newspaper telling everyone that
SDG&E is doing everything it can to lower their electric bills,
including asking the ISO for a $250 price cap, but the public can help
by calling the ISO [address and phone number provided in the ad] and
urging them to lower the cap.  I always thought the location of the ISO
was a State secret for security reasons.  No secrets in San Diego.

But we are not done.  No sir, we are not.  Those buffalo heads who run
that company decide they will win a gold star on their collective
foreheads, and implement one of the four resolutions passed by the
Electric Oversight Board.  The one they pick is to petition FERC on an
expedited basis to cap at $250, the price at which sellers may bid
energy or ancillary services into the ISO and the PX.  The primary
reason is that Western power markets are not workably competitive.  In
other words, they want FERC to set a max price on what generators can
sell in addition to the price limit at which the ISO can buy!

What I find most astounding about this double talk is that SDG&E
continues to collect tons of money from the sales of regulatory must run
energy into the PX.   These are sales from their stranded assets.  Their
grief hasn?t abated their greed.

So, to recap, SDG&E missed the boat on price hedging, failed to win
consumer confidence in public meetings, asked for help from suppliers
and did nothing in response, then filed at FERC to cap the sale price
because the wholesale market into which they sell (over-priced?) energy
is not workably competitive.  Too much time in the direct sun light.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ The PUC issues its scathing report

The PUC report released yesterday is a gem with which I have not spent
enough time.  I only read the Executive Summary, and that only because
our counsel, Dan Douglass forwarded me a copy. Let me pick out some of
the gems in President Lets Do Lynch?s burrito.  I would recommend
reading the whole text if you have time, and if you seek perverse
entertainment.

_California is experiencing major problems with electricity supply and
pricing caused by policies and procedures adopted over the past ten
years.

_ Since June, wholesale prices for electrical power in California have
increased on average 270% over the same period in 1999, resulting in
over $1 billion in excess   payments for electricity.

_Hot weather, aging power plant and transmission infrastructure, and
dysfunctional bidding behavior in the wholesale power markets combined
to drive prices up ...

_Because of serious market defects and tight supply of electricity,
purchasers of California power will likely pay billions more in
electricity costs this year. Moreover, these price increases do not
necessarily fund new investments in electricity supply or delivery
reliability - they may flow solely to power producer profit margins.

_Despite the Electricity Oversight Board's legislative mandate to
oversee those institutions, we have been unable to obtain [bid] data.
Nevertheless, ... , we believe enough evidence of questionable behavior
exists that the Attorney General should conduct an investigation into
these statewide market practices, coordinating with other State
agencies, including the PUC and the EOB. Such an investigation would
provide the factual foundation that California policy makers and
regulators need to recover any illegally obtained profits.

_A momentous consequence of California's attempt to create a market in
electricity is that the federal government now regulates California's
electric system. Washington D.C. now controls pricing decisions directly
at the wholesale level and indirectly at the retail level and, to the
extent that supply incentives are correlated to prices, Washington, D.C.
now affects California's ability to attract new investment in power
plants.

_Past administrations' willingness to cede the State's authority to the
federal government combined with the legislative creation of two
non-public supervisory organizations that have no duty to protect the
public or consider the retail customer. The "Independent System
Operator" (ISO) and the "Power Exchange" (PX), the nonprofit private
corporations that operate the State's transmission system and control
wholesale pricing policies, are governed by boards whose members can
have serious conflicts of interest. Some of these board members or their
companies financially benefit from higher prices in electricity markets.
Neither of these private organizations is accountable to the State or
its consumers ....


_Despite the federalization and the fragmentation of the State's
electric services, the State of California should protect its businesses
and consumers from cartel pricing; collusive behavior; inadequate power
plant maintenance and lack of market planning for adequate electricity
supplies.

_California consumers and businesses deserve to know in advance - as San
Diegans did not this summer - how and when the price of an essential
service like electricity will double. California is now largely
constrained by federal mandates from providing comprehensive retail
price relief as long as wholesale prices remain so high. If California
tried to re-impose a price freeze in San Diego now, federal regulators
would likely prevent that action.  ... Short-term price relief, however,
cannot resolve market gaming or fundamental wholesale pricing problems
controlled by federal regulators.

 _We have been precluded from obtaining the data necessary to know if
the ISO and PX failed to detect manipulation and gaming on several
fronts. We do not know how market players acted in price offering and
bidding and scheduling. The FERC has just announced an inquiry into
national pricing and energy market issues. California should not wait
for national findings before it investigates California market
practices. We recommend that the California Attorney General immediately
subpoena relevant records and data to determine the pricing and offering
behavior of market participants; the actions of the ISO and its board
members; and the actions of generators in supplying California's energy
needs.

_Ten Actions to Consider or Act Upon to Prevent Current Electricity
Problems From Spreading in 2001: ...



     2. Create a California Energy Council, modeled on the National
     Security Council, to unify State action to resolve energy
     problems and to perform integrated energy planning;

     3. Ask FERC for extended wholesale price cap authority to
     moderate California wholesale market pricing;

     4. Ask FERC to recognize the defects in the California and
     western regional markets and find that no competitive market
     exists in California power markets;


...


      8. Eliminate potential conflicts of interest in ISO/PX
     stakeholder boards;

     9. Improve California's ability to obtain ISO and generator
     data and enhance the State's enforcement capability for power
     plant maintenance; price manipulation and generation gaming,
     consistent with protection of proprietary business
     information;

     10. Provide the EOB with effective enforcement ability and
     additional oversight authority for the ISO and PX.

_Ten Issues to Consider or Act Upon Within the Next Six Months: ...


     4. Streamline state power plant siting procedures; consistent
     with environmental requirements, and prioritize applications
     to advance clean, BACT+ power plant proposals.

     5. Institute "use-it -or- lose-it" permitting power plant
     licensing and emissions credits rules to ensure power plants
     get built;

     ...

      8. Reform PX pricing protocols and structures to lower
     wholesale and retail prices and reduce excess profitsO

I told you I don?t need to write a Burrito anymore.  The Democrats in
Sacramento are doing that for me.  Welcome comrade.

>>> Things on the Island of California
 @@@ The ISO invokes $250 price caps.  Duh!

It is really hard to describe the drama of an ISO Governing Board
meeting, especially when our favorite topic arises.  It seems the only
time the Board becomes animated is when one of three issues are on the
agenda: price caps, FTRs, and priorities for software enhancements.
Otherwise, its pretty much hum-drum.

%Round and %round we went, once again.  A few more forced votes tipped
the scale in favor of the cap.  There were 15 yes votes, which included
a forced yes vote from our friend Jerry Toenyes by order of Secretary of
Energy Mr. Richardson. [Jerry, did you realize that the last letters of
your name could be re-arranged to spell _NO ET YESO?  Kind of a french
thing.] I?m sorry about that vote, Jerry.  You still go in my book as
one of the brave and bold for standing up to that sort of intimidation
for so long.  Your picture in the SF Chron said it all.

The brave souls who stood tall and voted NO included David Parquet
(Enron), Jan Smutny-Jones (IEP), Barbara Barkovich (CLECA), Caolyn
Kehrein (CMA), Dan Kirshner (EDF), and Stacy Roscoe (Procter & Gamble).
Now, I must admit that Dynegy?s Greg Blue did help by voting a Texas No,
spelled _A-B-S-T-A-I-NO.   I have instructed Dynegy trader Dave Francis
in Houston to work with Greg to correct that problem.  We?re going to
work things out.

The Energy F_hrer addressed the Board, again.  I didn?t mind that I only
had a few brief, very brief moments to address the Board, and Herr
(Hair?) Peace got over 20 minutes.  That didn?t bother me at all.  He
did more damage to himself in 20 than I could do in 2.  He blasted away
at everyone who opposed him.  He pined about Camden quitting the Board.
He said he knew how prices and markets work, that it isn?t the way those
academic egg-head, FERC-loving economists tell you who pray to the gods
of competition.  He lambasted WAPA for withholding generation to protect
fish and wildlife (what was that all about?).  He predicted that on
Thursday?s PUC meeting he and all the other powerful Democrats,
Republicans and angry citizens of San Diego would demand that the PUC
impose a rate cap on retail electric rates in San Diego that are just
and reasonable (it didn?t happen).  And on and on and on.  This man is
very delusional. He believes that Steve, and only Steve Peace can save
the world.  He believes that political will trumps judicial,
quasi-judicial, or independent Board actions.  This man makes relevant
all the abstract musings of the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche
(1844-1900) ... The will to power, the ?bermensch, the transvaluation of
values, etc.

But we are getting under (uber?) his skin, with the help of the press.
Wednesday afternoon I called Commissioner Dick Bilas to see if he
thought whether the next day?s PUC meeting was going to be a roll over.
Dick said he got a call from Peace, and that Peace said he would not
come to the meeting.  Apparently, Peace had received a lot of press, and
all of it bad.

That?s the thin line of freedom which keeps tyranny at least one step
away from our front door.

 >>> Things at the throne of FERC
 @@@ Amen for the Morgan Stanley Order

And now, the good news.  You deserve this.  FERC gave the California
market a little wiggle room last Friday.  FERC issued a last minute
reply to the complaint by Morgan Stanley Capital Group relating to the
ISO?s intent to lower the price cap.  FERC denied the complaint, but
they didn?t waste time with an Order to simply deny a complaint.  FERC
danced on the head of the ISO and pulled the bite out of the price cap.

Here are some excerpts:

_We accepted this [Amendment 21], not because it was a cap on sellers?
prices but because it would promote order and transparency in the market
by clearly telling sellers of the maximum price the ISO was willing to
pay and allowing sellers to make informed economic choices on whether to
sell in the ISO market or to sell elsewhere...

_ ... The ISO has no more or less ability to procure capacity and energy
than any other buyer of these services ... If the ISO is unable to
elicit sufficient supplies at or below its announced purchase price
ceiling (because generators are free to sell elsewhere if they choose),
it will have to raise its purchase price to the level necessary to meet
its needs. ... Therefore, an increase in out-of-market (OOM) calls for
generation may be necessary to maintain system reliability.  Because the
current payment for OOM is not subject to a maximum purchase price, the
resulting overall payments may be higher.

_To the extent the ... ISO Board resolution contemplates implementing a
directive that generators must bid their capacity into the ISO markets
under any circumstances (e.g., when system load exceeds 38,000 MW), such
a requirement is not permitted by our ... Order and the ISO tariff. ...
Future implementation of the ISO Board resolution with regard to a
requirement to sell would require significant revisions to the ISO
market rules.  Such market changes could not become effective absent a
corresponding amendment to the ISO tariff which would have to be filed
under section 205 of the FPA.O

Well. What do you think about that?

Just wait.  Here is what the sleeping bear, Commissioner Hebert said in
his concurring remarks:

_Getting to the bottom of the problem, in my view, requires us to begin
a proceeding to rescind our approval of the ISO as the operator of the
California grid.  The record supports such a move. ... A memorandum to
the ISO from a stakeholder who resigned from the governing board
eloquently brings to our attention repeated attempts to undermine the
independence of the ISO. The memorandum also thoughtfully outlines
consequences to the markets of a return to %command and control.?

_Because these allegations come from a non-market participant,
especially should we take heed.  We must also take notice of the public
pressure on the Board to compromise its independence.O

Amen, brother, amen.

>>> Odds and Ends (_!_)

As you can imagine, this week, like an endless string of weeks before
this has been interminable.  I get about three phone calls a day from
press reporters, very little of which ever sees print.  My shtick is
just too complex for casual readers.  But I do notice that the reporters
are asking better questions.  The public is becoming more savvy.  The
information flow is moving in our favor, and will disarm the forces of
evil, in about 10 years.

I have other problems on my mind.  I am working on a new computer
system.  Really, it?s just an upgrade of an older computer that is a bit
faster than the laptop I tried to upgrade, very unsuccessfully.  As a
result of the all the new hardware and software I purchased, my office
looks like a war zone with an odd mix of PUC service copies, computer
documentation, and diskettes laying all around. Quite a mess.

Prepare for the future.  Our next general meeting is scheduled for
Thursday and Friday, October 5 and 6 at Moro Bay.  Barb Ennis will
prepare a blurb for us in next week?s Burrito about room reservations,
timing, golf, etc.  Our guest speakers will include MSC Chairman
Professor Frank Wolak who will talk on the subject of his choice, Ms.
Irene Moosen of Grueneich Resource Advocates who will make a
presentation on the distributed generation case before the PUC, and
William Freddo of PG&E National Energy Group who will give us some
education on operating a power plant inside the New England ISO.

Now for your daily bread, provided this week by Dan Douglass.  Last week
we had a joke about Catholics.  This week it?s agnostics.
=====================
An atheist was taking a walk thru the woods, admiring all that the
accident  of evolution had created.  "What majestic trees!  What
powerful rivers! What  beautiful animals!"  he said to himself.

As he was walking alongside the river he heard a rustling in the bushes
behind him.  As he turned to look, he saw a 7 foot grizzly bear
charging  towards him. He ran as fast as he could up the path.  He
looked over his  shoulder and saw that the bear was closing in on him.
He tried to run even  faster, so scared that tears were coming to his
eyes. His heart was pumping  frantically as he tried to run even faster,
but he tripped and fell on the  ground.  He rolled over to pick himself
up and saw the bear right on top of  him raising its paw to kill him.

At that instant he cried out "Oh my God!" And time stopped. The bear
froze.  The forest was silent.  The river even stopped flowing.  A
bright light shone  upon the man, and a voice out of the sky said, "You
deny my existence all  these years, teach others I don't exist and even
credit my creation to a  cosmic accident, and now do you expect me to
help you out of this  predicament?  Am I to count you as a believer?"

The atheist, ever so proud, looked into the light and said, "It would be
rather hypocritical to ask to be counted as a believer after all these
years,  but could you make the bear a believer?"

"Very well" said the voice. And the light went out, the river flowed,
the  sounds of the forest continued, and the bear brought both paws
together,  bowed his head, and said, "Lord, I thank you for this food
which I am about  to receive."
==================

Amen.  And have a great weekend.  Oh, and thanks to all of you who sent
me happy birthday wishes.  It was very much appreciated.

Bob and Jeff, 

Attached is the list of counterparties who are striking our CAISO language in 
Confirmations along with the Counterparties who do not include the reference 
to CAISO on their confirmations (we actually attach an "Attachment A" with 
the CAISO language).

I would be grateful if you could begin having discussions with these 
counterparties on how CAISO is the product that EPMI buys/sells at the ISO in 
Ca. 

Many thanks,

We recently installed two new digital copiers in the break room.  For the 
most part, they are very user friendly, and I have been able to make 
different types of copy jobs without any training at all.  However, we have 
the capability to provide formal training with a Xerox representative on a 
prescheduled basis.  

A training session, which can accommodate five people for training, is 
scheduled for Thursday at 9:30 a.m.  The training takes an hour and a half.  
If more than five individuals request training on Thursday, I will schedule 
another training session at a later date.

For your information, if you are not interested in formal training there is 
an instructional CD that you can borrow to learn about the features of the 
equipment, and there is a manual you can borrow if you would like to borrow 
it for instructional purposes.

Please contact me if you are interested in attending Xerox training on 
Thursday at 9:30 a.m. or if you would be interested in training at another 
time, and I will coordinate these training efforts.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Legal has been assessing the risks of doing block forward trades as financial 
and for now, subject to future changes that may be required  as discussions 
with the CAPX legal experts continue,  we can state the basic rules as 
follows:

It is okay to do up to 50% of  our Block Forward business as financial.
It is very important to monitor this 50% level very closely and we should not 
exceed it. We should not rely on the PX to tell us what the level is. We 
should confirm it ourselves.  A skeptical regulator, looking at PX records 
should never be able to see that we ever did more than half our block forward 
business as financial.  
One of the legal rules that we must comply with in this area is that there 
must be a bona fide commercial reason for going financial.  This 
dumbfoundingly simple sounding rule is important.  Somehow, when we 
communicate our decision to the PX to go from physical to financial, we 
should give our reason.  I'm not sure whether our decision is expressed by 
phone, or electronically, but in either case,  the person making the change 
with the PX should get in an expression something like this:  "we would like 
to change these trades to financial because we think the elimination of 
physical risk will benefit us commercially."  Please be patient with this 
self serving requirement and do it. 

 I have not worked out with any of the other back office groups how this new 
practice will be handled. Obviously any changes it will require in 
scheduling, settlements and accounting need to be dealt with too. Please call 
me with any questions.  ----cgy

As you are probably aware, the CPUC voted 5-0 to reject instituting retail 
rate caps in San Diego and instead adopted SDG&E's proposal to refund over 
$100 million.  The Commission also approved SCE and PG&E's motion to enter 
into bilateral agreements and schedule those transactions through the PX 
using the bilateral-option market.  These transactions will be confidential 
and will be disclosed only to the Commission's energy division, for purposes 
of reasonableness.  The Commission did not act upon San Diego's advice letter 
(#1242) to facilitate customer awareness of competitive alternatives.  That 
advice letter will not be acted upon until the next Commission meeting in 
September.

The Commission has also opened an investigation into the role of the utility 
as a default provider and will explore how the utility should pass along its 
costs to the customers.  It will also address whether SDG&E should be 
authorized to participate in bilateral contracts in addition to PX 
purchases.  It also opens the door to consider alternative exchange.  This is 
a fast track investigation, so I will set up a call to discuss early next 
week.

Sandi McCubbin and I were in Sacramento yesterday meeting with several of the 
key legislative offices.  There was also an interested party meeting (AB 1890 
Implementation Group).  From those meetings, it was apparent that Steve Peace 
is interested in legislation to institute rate caps in San Diego, re-vamp the 
governance structure of the ISO and PX boards, having market participants 
(generators, marketers, utilities) share in some of the pain that San Diego's 
consumers feel, extend the rate freeze, etc.  Although, most of the other 
legislative offices saw this proposal as a total morass.

The legislative offices that we met with, while interested in providing some 
political cover to DeDe Alpert (Senator from San Diego in a close political 
race), were not interested in pursuing sweeping changes to the current 
structure, although this could change.  However, it should be noted that DeDe 
Alpert said herself that she would introduce rate cap legislation in San 
Diego when the legislature reconvenes on August 7.  Most of the discussion 
with the other offices was on what can be done by next summer and focused on 
bringing on peaking plants and expanding demand responsive programs.

Sandi and Dave Parquet also met with John Stevens, of the Governor's Office.  
He stated that the Governor did not want any major changes to the current 
structure to come across his desk, but that the Governor needed our help in 
preventing such changes from getting there, otherwise he may be politically 
compelled to sign the legislation.  Sandi will send out more information 
later, she's having computer problems.

There will be a hearing next week of the Senate and Assembly Energy 
Committees on San Diego issues on August 10.

We, in GA, will keep you updated on developments.

I'm so glad you want to help!

I'll put you down as wanting to help and I'll let you know what happens with 
the meeting.

The tentative dates are:
Information Session Sep 18
Interviews  Nov 8 Reception
   Nov 9 First Round, on campus
   Nov 10 Second Round, on campus

Super Saturday for Wharton folks will be the first weekend of December.

I'll definitely keep you posted.  We've had people fly from Portland before, 
so it's definitely possible to get you out for events or interviews if your 
schedule allows.

THE FRIDAY BURRITO
"...more fun than a fortune cookie, and at least as accurate."

There is a hint of Autumn in the air.  I don=0F't know if it=0F's wishful
thinking, or if the seasons are really beginning to turn from our pale
summer into a Bay Area glorious Fall.  It=0F's premature, I know.  A few
fallen leaves, the start of schools, slightly longer afternoon shadows
... I=0F'm jumping the gun.  I can=0F't wait for this summer to be over,
especially this summer.  The pounding never stops, and as I hear the din
of the cash register ringing with each climb in Southwest temperature, I
can barely keep track of all the hiccups which drive prices up: fires in
Montana restricting transmission paths, blown up interstate gas pipeline
in New Mexico, diminishing N-Ox credits for in-state power plants,
depleted inventory of hours of voluntary load interruptions for
commercial and industrial customers, credit limits restricting imports
of Canadian power into the Northwest and California, and BPA buying
about 1,000 MW to cover its short hydro position.

 I also get the willies every time another politician lambastes the
California restructured power industry.  I just want to end to the
summer, now, and start a two week Fall vacation ... anywhere, even in
Cleveland.

There are seven, count them, seven investigations into some aspect of
the wholesale power market out here.  Two days ago there were only six,
but FERC just added another yesterday in response to the Prez=0F's
request.  That means FERC has two, the PUC has two, the State Attorneys
General has two (one on the ISO Governing Board, and one on the in-state
generators), and one by the Electric Oversight Board.  If you don=0F't have
an ongoing study of the California Market, then you=0F're not hip.

All of these investigations, save FERC=0F's Section 206 Investigation, are
going to amount to near nothing.  A lot of wasted time and paper.  The
PUC and EOB studies have their conclusion sections all finished.  Now
they need some evidence to support their assertions.

And how are we holding up under all of this?  How are you doing?  I talk
to many of you throughout the week, and I know how frustrated you are.
I share your frustration.  You want to tell the public, the press, and
anyone in between the truth.  You want to lay out the facts.  You want
to show anyone who will listen that each interference into the market is
making things worse, not better.  The price caps, for example, are
damnable and screwing up the prices, much to the detriment of those
people for who price caps were supposed to be a protection against price
shocks.  Now they are receiving higher average prices.

The public isn=0F't going to listen to anything longer than a sound bite.
And let=0F's face it, when it comes to stellar public relations, our
industry is not known for turning in A+ performances, except for SCE.
Those guys seem to get their story in front of the public at every
turn.  I heard SCE is putting on their customers=0F' bill, =0F"Here is what
you would have paid if the rate freeze ended ....=0F".  But many of us in
the new power industry, borne from the loins of either the natural-gas
industry or nuclear-power business, learned the hard way that the best
response to a public inquiry is a two-block head start in front of an
angry mob.  Keep your head down, shut your mouth, and this too shall
pass.

I don=0F't buy that approach, at least not anymore.  That is, I don=0F't
believe we have anything to hide, or of which to be ashamed.  What
electric restructuring is about is correct, beneficial to the public,
and in everyone=0F's best interests.  Look at it this way, when they pat
the last shovelful of dirt on your final resting place, for what do you
most want to be remembered?  That you caved in to the political will of
others, or at a moment when you had the chance, you did what was right
instead of what was expedient?  I think the choice is easy, albeit laced
with sheer terror.  Those bland homilies I so diligently teach my kids
(e.g., tell the truth, do what is right, think of the big picture and
not just yourself) are a lot easier to speak than to live by.  So join
me and stand up for what you believe.  They can=0F't take away your pride,
not yet.

Here is this week=0F's line up.

 @@@ Excerpts from FERC=0F's Order on SDG&E Complaint

President Clinton commented from the Rose Garden that good folks in San
Diego, retired, fixed-income, likely to vote for a Democrat, are making
choices between buying medicine or air conditioning their homes.  I call
this the Del Monica Beach lecture.  The Prez instructed the FERC to
investigate the situation in California, and FERC wasted no time.

In response to SDG&E=0F's August 2 complaint, whereby the utility asked
FERC to impose a $250 price cap on generators in the region, the FERC
responded in a way that I was hoping to see several months ago.  The
FERC slammed SDG&E on their complaint for lack of merit, and the FERC
also initiated an FPA Section 206 Investigation into the wholesale power
market in California.

Here are some of the juicy excerpts from FERC=0F's Order:

=0F"In this order, ... , we are denying SDG&E's requested immediate
imposition of a price cap on all sellers in California.  However, we are
instituting consolidated hearing   proceedings pursuant to section 206
of the Federal Power Act to investigate the justness and reasonableness
of the rates and charges of public utilities that sell energy and
ancillary services to or through the California ISO and PX, and to also
investigate whether the tariffs and institutional structures and bylaws
of the California ISO and PX are adversely affecting the efficient
operation of competitive wholesale electric power markets in California
and need to be modified

=0F"SDG&E concludes that the markets cannot be workably competitive if
sellers are able to exact prices that are considerably above levels that
would prevail in open competition, i.e., sellers are able to bid and
receive prices significantly above their marginal costs.  SDG&E also
argues that the hour-to-hour volatility in imbalance energy prices and
the erratic clearing price for ancillary services is an indication that
the market is breaking down when it is moderately stressed.

=0F"While we find it appropriate to institute a section 206 hearing on
these issues, we cannot implement an immediate price cap of $250/MWh as
requested by SDG&E because there is no record before us to support such
an action.  ...  While the issues raised by this complaint are
important, the Commission has no basis to conclude that SDG&E's proposal
to place an immediate, arbitrary $250/MWh cap on the price that every
public utility seller of energy and ancillary services may bid into the
PX and ISO markets would satisfy this standard.  SDG&E has provided no
evidence to demonstrate that all potential sellers are able to exercise
market power, has not documented a single instance of a seller
exercising market power during times of scarcity, and did not attempt to
show that the conditions underlying the Commission's approval of
market-based rates for public utility sellers of energy and ancillary
services have changed.  Nor did it address specific market or
institutional  factors that may be causing rates to be unjust or
unreasonable.

=0F"SDG&E asserts that the ISO's congestion management and market
structures are flawed and in need of overhaul. ... Furthermore, SDG&E
expresses its concern that, for a number of reasons, the congestion
management and market reform efforts being pursued by ISO stakeholders
will not produce  meaningful results.  SDG&E indicates that it is
prepared to work with the ISO to develop alternative reform proposals;
however, SDG&E's complains that the ISO stakeholder process has, in
SDG&E's judgment, been ineffective with respect to these issues.

=0F"Various interveners contend that SDG&E's arguments are premature. ...
We agree with Interveners. ...  The reform efforts have been the subject
of extensive public review and comment and are nearing completion.
Accordingly, we reject SDG&E's arguments at this time.

=0F"It is unclear whether SDG&E's failure to purchase hedging instruments
for its retail operations is due to state regulatory policies or its
business decisions.  A retail rate design that exposes consumers to the
volatility of commodity prices would be extraordinary, particularly when
consumers do not have the ability to receive or respond to price
signals.

=0F"We are concerned that ... increasing level of market activity in the
real-time market raises significant reliability and economical concerns.
...  Historically, the ISO procures on a daily basis only the resources
needed for the operating day.  Not only does this procurement practice
put pressure on the grid operator to secure needed resources at the last
minute, but the practice is uneconomical.  Such spot-market purchases
are not subject to the ISO's  buyer's cap.  Furthermore, because the ISO
is the supplier of last resort for these services, when OOM calls are
made, suppliers realize that the ISO is in a must-buy situation.

=0F"In an effort to address this problem, we direct the ISO to immediately
institute a more forward approach to procuring the resources necessary
to reliably operate the grid.  Specifically, the ISO should anticipate
the need for such additional resources based on  forecasted peak
periods.  We direct the ISO to factor these reforms into an analysis of
the need for and level of purchase price caps and to include this
analysis as support for any filing it makes to extend its purchase price
cap authority.=0F"

In closing, WPTF is an intervenor in the case, and we hope to be very
active in the case through testimony, cross examination, the filing of
briefs, and reply briefs.

>>> Things in the People=0F's Republic of California
 @@@ The Development of a Super-Peak Block Energy Product

Several weeks ago, I discussed with the ISO their interest in developing
a new market for a block energy product that would be purchased in the
morning of a trade day, and be dispatched during the super-peak hours.
I challenged them to let the market participants develop this market
instead of the ISO doing the same.

At the August 1 ISO Governing Board meeting, I stated as the WPTF
position that we oppose price caps, but if the ISO Governing Board
insisted on going down the $250/MWH price cap route, we would do what
ever we could to help the situation and avoid the occurrences of Stage 3
alerts.  Whereas I didn=0F't think about the conversation on super-peak
block markets as being relevant to  the remarks before the Governing
Board, it became painfully clear soon after that we could, and should
work with the ISO to develop a new market through either APX or the
California PX, or both, to bring some order to the otherwise chaotic Out
of Market system.

This week, WPTF and the ISO had a joint meeting whereby both sides
discussed the merits of a super-peak block firm-energy product, and how
it could be instituted.  The meeting at the ISO, at which WPTF had many
of its members who either have generation in the State, or import power
into California, was for market participants and the ISO to discuss how
to bring more order and price transparency to the ISO's out of market
calls. The ISO reported that this summer, to date, the amount of money
spent on Out of Market purchases was about $100 million.  Last year the
total cost of Out of Market purchases was $1.7 million.

APX and CalPX, in response to our earlier discussions with them,
presented their proposals at the meeting.  The discussions which ensued
during the course of the presentations focused on how the ISO might
utilize a product/service to reduce the manpower requirements currently
needed to satisfy its out of market telephone calls, typically on short
notice, and the interest on the part of market participants to make bids
into either the APX or CalPX's proposed system for a super-peak
firm-energy product.

There were no  commitments made by any party, simply a willingness to
work together to alleviate the problems associated with finding
sufficient electric power during high demand periods with greater
transparency, more participants, and greater market efficiency.

We=0F'll keep you posted on our development of this market.

>>> The Mailbag: A Letter from My Friend, and A Response

Sometimes I share bites of our Burrito with fellow travellers, much as I
did last week when I sent my friend Mike Florio a copy of the story
called the Trial of Gow Jing.  Mike sent me a note that I would like to
share. He said I could.  I want you to read it and appreciate that there
are other people who share his view.  I also copied the response I sent
to Michael, a.k.a. Old Deuteronomy.

Michael wrote:

=0F"I'm not going to attempt to complete your little melodrama [the
Gow-Jing story], but I did want to offer an observation.  In simpler
times, people knew the other people that they did business with, and
they typically lived in the same community.  If a merchant tried to
charge exorbitant prices for his products, even if he was the only one
in town who had the product in stock, he would face the wrath of his
fellow citizens.  This undoubtedly served as a constraint on such
behavior, even in the absence of a CPUC or FERC. Telling Mrs. Jones that
the loaf of bread she needs to feed her kids will cost her $50 would not
be a pleasant way to do business, and such things ordinarily did not
happen.

=0F"In the modern global economy, of course, this personal aspect of doing
business has been almost completely lost.  And so has the restraint.  I
have no doubt that the folks who sell electricity are good people (jeez,
I know many of them), but they work in an environment where the end
results of their business decisions are invisible.  If Mrs. Jones can't
afford to run her refrigerator any more, that fact is at best dimly
perceived, and if so it is viewed as cause for some sort of social
program, not a reason why a merchant would alter his behavior.

=0F"This is clearly not a case of socialism versus capitalism, because both
scenarios occur within the overall context of a capitalist system.  But
certainly something fundamental has changed, and not for the better in
my view.  Now everyone feels compelled to squeeze the last dollar out of
every transaction-- their jobs may even depend upon it-- and no one is
responsible for the end result.  Is this the kind of world we want to
live in???

=0F"PUT THAT IN YOUR BURRITO AND SEE WHAT YOUR READERS SAY!  YOU CAN EVEN
BLAME ME, SO THAT YOU ARE NOT ACCUSED OF TURNING PINK IN YOUR MIDDLE
AGE.      Deut=0F"

Okay.  It=0F's in the Burrito.  And here is what I think.

You allude to the change in a world that was once =0F"more personal=0F" and=
 is
now institutional.  You make the point that things are not better off if
for no other reason then the lack of personal accountability.  But I
don=0F't think that in all cases the more personal world is lost.  It is
ever present, as I will argue below.  Second, your group embraces the
impersonal =0F"efficiencies=0F" when it is convenient.  Finally and most
importantly, where will your social-minded and like minded counterparts
be when competitive forces leap supply ahead of demand, which might
happen in a handful of years?

However, your essential point is not lost on me.  I do believe that
there are ways for generators and consumers to be good neighbors in
California.  I have a proposal below to which I would like to hear your
response.

First, though, the personal business touch is present in our economy.  I
exercise the restraint to which your story pines in many of my
consulting engagements which require financial give and take between
client and vendor.  It is simply smart business to do so.  I have been
the beneficiary of the same with my local bank when errors occurred in
my checking accounts, or when loan payments were made absent mindedly
late, etc., and the late fee forgiven.  However, much of our economy,
and certainly the trade of a commodity such as electricity requires the
use of markets.  Nameless and faceless, they do squeeze out all the
efficiencies which lead to lower prices, more innovation, and a sharing
of price risk with parties who are neither the ultimate consumer nor the
initial producer.  The producer and consumer get out of the risk
arbitrage and leave it to others who are more skilled and monied.

I find it ironic that TURN, then, is so insistent on arguing, as it has
done on many many occasions for the relaxation of market separation in
the ISO=0F's congestion management reform.  Elimination of market
separation is nothing more than the impersonal forcing of parties to
execute trades on either side of a congested transmission path in the
name of market efficiency.  Lower prices for consumers.  Does it really
matter if it is done through person to person transactions, or through
markets?

Third, your story can be used to make an alternative point.  What
happens to the merchant in town when Wal-Mart moves into the next town
down the road?  All the faithful customers that your Merchant of
Vengeance was protecting suddenly migrate to a competitor with greater
inventory, more choice, and lower prices.  What do you say, then?  The
corollary for us is direct.  The new generation owners moved literally
billions of dollars into California, at risk, and took a chance.  It
paid off.  They succeeded as we all know this year, and probably will
next year, and so on.  But the 3,000 MW of new power plants under
construction in California, and the 3,000 MW under construction in
Arizona, and the over 16,000 MW of combined power projects in
California, Arizona, and Southern Nevada that are in line for permits
will change the financial landscape in a hurry once energized.  The
prices will soften, returns will be less cherry, and I really want to
know, where will today=0F's accusers be when there is a shake out?
Consumers will reap that benefit, oh you best believe it. But the
alliances to which your opening story alludes simply misses that point.
You gotta make hay while the sun shines.

Now to my proposal.   Michael, I would be willing to work with you to
develop some kind of loan program for residential and small commercial
customers that would, in effect, reduce the economic hardship of higher
electricity prices.  I could imagine, although I haven=0F't tested the idea
with any parties,  that a significant program could be crafted, possibly
secured by the credit of participating generating companies, and
executed by a commercial lending institution such as Bank of America.
Borrowers would pay a fair interest rate and the administrative fees.
It=0F's simply smart business, not charity.  It=0F's one way to amortize th=
e
earnings which came about due to a circumstance of short supply relative
to the sudden growth of demand for power.

Maybe that is a step in the right direction, I don=0F't know. One could
argue that it is no different than SDG&E implementing a level payment
plan for it=0F's consumers.  True, it is no different, because in either
case the customer is paying for the loan interest and administrative
fees, and I consistently believe that a market for credit is more
efficient (am I getting impersonal?) than one instituted by a
monopoly.   Second, the security for these loans is provided by parties
other than the utility=0F's customers.  Further, we wouldn=0F't have to wor=
ry
about PUC oversight and prudence reviews.  We could make this work
quickly.

I will be very interested to hear your thoughts, and the comments of my
members.  Thanks for sending us your letter.

 @@@ Finish the Story Contest

Well, there was only one response, and that was from Carl Imparato.
Here is what Carl said,

=0F"Am I missing something? Who is Gow-Jing supposed to represent? (Yes, I
get the pun in the name.  But is he also just an anonymous "everyman" or
is there someone in particular?)

=0F"My first response to your question is that Gow-Jing simply replies
=0F`Itai!=0F' (You could look it up... I think it's Chinese for =0F`it hurt=
s!=0F').
Then he takes out a concealed axe, goes on a rampage and kills
everyone.  But that's too realistic, so don't use that ending.  Instead:


=0F"Ending:  Just as he was about to reply, a giant 500 foot wall of water
swept through the room, drowning everyone.  And they lived happily ever
after.  The end."

I haven=0F't decided whether to name this response Carl=0F's Gilgamesh Epic
(I.e., Noah and the flood), or Carl=0F's Hydro Dream.  We=0F'll leave the
contest open for another week.  Can=0F't let $5 bucks go the only entry.

 @@@ What Makes Houston, Houston?

Dan Douglass of Arter and Hadden sent us the following item. Houston,
the unofficial home of the electric power industry, is a town you either
love or hate.  Here are some guiding principles offered by the Chamber
of Commerce of the 4th largest city to enable their many visitors to
cope.

=0F=07   First you must learn to pronounce the city  name. It is YEWS-TUN a=

is to
turn around and start over when you reach Dallas, Texas.

=0F=07   All directions start with, "Go down  Westheimer..."

=0F=07   Westheimer has no beginning and no end.

=0F=07   It's impossible to go around a block and wind up on the street  yo=

=0F=07   The 8am rush hour is from 6:30 to 9:30am. The 5:00 pm rush hour is
from 3:30 to 6:30 pm.  Friday's rush hour starts on Thursday morning.

=0F=07   If you actually stop at a yellow light, you cannot be from Houston=
.

=0F=07   Kuykendahl Road can only be pronounced by a native, so do not
attempt the phonetic pronunciation. People will simply tilt their heads
to the right and stare at you.

=0F=07   Construction on the Gulf Freeway is a way of life, and a permanent
form of entertainment.

=0F=07   Many bizarre sights can be explained simply by uttering the phrase=
,
" Oh, we're in Montrose!!"

=0F=07   Construction crews aren't doing their job properly  unless they
close down all lanes except one during rush hour.

=0F=07   If  someone actually has their turn signal on, it was probably lef=
t
on at the factory where the car was made.

=0F=07   White haired men driving red or silver sports cars will not obey a=
ny
known traffic rule and cannot be expected to stop for red lights or stop
signs.

=0F=07   All ladies with blue hair who drive Cadillacs or Lincoln
Continentals have the right of way.

=0F=07   The above mentioned blue haired ladies also have a  legal right to
turn right from a left lane or to turn left from a right  lane. YOU HAVE
BEEN WARNED!

=0F=07   Buying a  Houston street map is a waste of money since there is
absolutely no way that you can route yourself in such a manner as to
avoid major road construction.

=0F=07   Houston natives are so rare that they are listed on the endangered
species list. The few remaining specimens are kept in a controlled
environment for their own safety.

=0F=07   Sir" and "Ma'am" are used by the person speaking to you if there's=
 a
remote  possibility that you're at least 30 minutes older than they are.

=0F=07   "Sugar" is a more common form of  address than "Miss". So is
"Honey". Do not take offense. This is how southerners address grown
women.

=0F=07   In Houston we drink Coca-Cola  and Dr. Pepper. It is rumored that
other soft drinks are sold here, but no one will admit to knowing anyone
who actually drinks them.  So don't ask for any other soft drink.

=0F=07   What you need to know when arriving at Bush Intercontinental
Airport: Your arrival gate is at least 32 miles away from the Main
Concourse of any terminal.  Walking heels on your boots or walking shoes
are advised.

=0F=07   Never honk your horn at another car in Houston traffic. The bumper
sticker that reads, "Keep honking, I'm reloading" is considered fair
warning.

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Have a great weekend, y=0F'all.

  Market Participants and Schedule Coordinators,

  Please be advised that all Supplemental Energy bids
(including imports and exports) submitted to the ISO for use in the
real-time Imbalance Energy Market are considered to be "FIRM" (i.e., the
bids cannot be withdrawn after 45 minutes prior to the Settlement Period and
can be dispatched by the ISO anytime during the Settlement Period, see - ISO
Tariff o 2.5.22.4.1).

  Any bids labeled as "Non- Firm" or reported to the CAISO
real-time scheduler as "Non-Firm" or recallable will be rejected.  The CAISO
does not carry the necessary excess reserves to support "Non-Firm"
Supplemental Imports.

  If there are any questions concerning this practice please
contact Brian Rahman at 916-608-5883.

  The ISO will be hosting a Participating Load Stakeholder
meeting on September 20, 2000 at the ISO.  The meeting is a broad
stakeholder meeting to help refine our load participation programs for 2001.
Much of the day will be committed to presentations and discussions on
lessons learned from 2000 and proposals for 2001, including technical
standards, contractual issues, and load management.

  Some vendors have approached the ISO with systems that would
aggregate loads, give them an opportunity to curtail based on day ahead
energy prices, and provide the curtailment instructions and verifications.
This type of program may be ultimately sold to ESPs or IOUs. In order to
accelerate the testing of such systems the ISO may sponsor a pilot program
to test the system/approach with selected vendors.  The pilot program will
test the concepts, the interfaces, and assist in bringing together vendors,
ESPs, SCs, and the IOUs as we move forward toward improving demand
responsiveness in our markets.  We have reserved about 1 -2 hours in the
afternoon, to allow 3-4 vendors to present their approaches to the
stakeholder group.

  In addition, we welcome you to visit a vendor fair that the
ISO is hosting on September 21, 2000.  The ISO has  experienced
considerable interest from the market place in such a vendor fair that would
include entities providing Data Processing Gateway technology for both
Generators and Loads in the Participating Ancillary Services Load Program.
This effort is being encouraged to develop multiple solutions pertaining to
installations of direct telemetry for Generators and Load providing
Ancillary Services to the ISO markets.

  The agendas are attached for both events, including
directions and lodging information.
  Please RSVP by September 13, 2000 to Sue Happ at
shapp@caiso.com.
  Thank you.

Both SCE and PG&E have been authorized to purchase energy, capacity, and 
ancillary services through bilateral contracts.
Quantities are limited to previously authorized limits in the forward market 
(the PX Block Forward Markets)
The contracts must expire on or before 12/31/05.
For both PG&E and SCE, these contracts will be subject to limited 
reasonableness review.
PG&E will not be allowed to enter into such contracts after the transition 
period ends (3/31/02). The Commission will continue e to oversee the 
procurement practices on a quarterly basis. 
This was an emergency motion, so it is reasonable to assume that both PG&E 
and SCE can enter into such transactions immediately.

SDG&E is authorized to enter into bids for 6*16 delivery period or a 7*24 
delivery period for terms of 8/00 through 12/00 or 8/00 through 3/01. 
SDG&E will submit bids to buy energy a levelized price for both terms.
SDG&E will bid only for small commercial and residential customers under 20kW
The quantities are limited to the quantities that they had approved in the

Big Bob,

Writing to say hello. I returned to the states three
weeks ago and have been working at Camp Horno with the
1/1 since that time. It has been about three weeks.
The job is actually pretty good. I run the sick call
for the unit and do someother admin type things. Other
than that my time is pretty much my own. No call over
nifgt every third night at the hospital or some
asshole doctor chewing your ass about taking care of
patients. I still feel kind of out of the loop with
the other Marine officers but something tells me that
probably will not change. Likely, they look at me like
the friendly and tolerable neighborhood nerd who is
there to take care of the troops and give people light
duty chits. At least they leave me alone and give me a
chance to work out. The hills around Camp P are brutal
and unforgiving. I hope to be in good enough condition
in two-three more weeks to start running up the bigger
ones in the morning.
   That is about it. Wanted to say hello and defend
and deflect any artillery shells you and rat are
lobbing against me behind my back!!!!

 DJ US Northwest Pwr Forwards Higher On Water; SW 3Q Up

 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Forward prices for electricity in the northwest U.S.
rose
 Thursday on concerns about hydroelectric supplies in the region, traders
said.

 Hydroelectric dam reservoirs are low in the Northwest due to a lack of rain
the past
 several weeks. River flows have been even lower than forecast this week,
and
 hydroelectric generators have been run as much as possible to make up for
reductions
 in supply from the Colstrip generating station in Montana. Transmission
lines from the
 station had to be turned off several times over the past two weeks due to
forest fires in
 the state.

 "All the generators on the Columbia River right now are sucking mud," one
northwest
 utility prescheduler said Thursday.

 Southwest prompt forwards were flat Thursday, but third quarter 2001
contracts started
 racing higher late in the day. Traders said that Enron Corp. is a big
buyer. The market
 rumor is that the California Independent System Operator is in the market
for 3,000
 megawatts of supply for next summer.

 California-Oregon Border contracts for September traded Thursday at
$197-$205 per
 megawatt-hour, compared with Wednesday's range of $181-$190/MWh.

 October COB traded at $139-$145/MWh, compared with $126-$129/MWh Wednesday.


 September Palo Verde contracts traded at $175-$178/MWh, unchanged.
Third-quarter
 2001 Palo Verde traded at $182-$200/MWh Thursday, compared with
$175-$177/MWh
 Wednesday.

 =DJ BIG PICTURE: Wider Econ Risks In California's Power Woes


    By John McAuley
    Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES


 NEW YORK (Dow Jones)--Hot weather and a still-robust economy have
intensified
 electricity demand in the face of drum-tight power supplies in California,
the nation's
 most populous - and, in economic terms, most important - state.

 The resultant rolling "brown outs" and the potential for blackouts in the
future could have
 a noticeable empirical and real impact on industrial production in
California and even in
 the national statistics. Indeed, the impact is likely to be greatest in the
highest
 value-added sectors: computers and computer components, two industries that
have
 been a key engine of U.S. growth.

 Not only that, electricity generation is an important proxy in the Federal
Reserve's
 estimation of industrial production. So, the measurement of statistics
could be directly
 affected.

 About half of the industrial output contained in the industrial production
index is
 compiled on the basis of actual output volumes - tons of steel, boardfeet
of lumber, or
 millions of autos assembled, etc. For other forms of output, accounting for
about a
 quarter of the index, contributions to total production are estimated based
on hours
 worked data, with the implicit assumption that productivity - or the rate
of real output per
 labor hour - doesn't change much over short periods of time in these
industries. But the
 remainder of the index, about 26% according to a Fed economist, is
estimated using
 electricity generation measures.

 For this purpose, electricity generation is itself estimated from measures
of electric
 power usage by industry. Here, as with productivity, the technical
coefficient, or the
 amount of electricity input per unit of output, is assumed to be constant
over relatively
 long periods.


         As Usual, Things Are Different In California


 California power companies, as part of the deregulation of the electric
power industry,
 offer their business customers "interruptible rate plans". That means that
for a
 discounted rate, customers "voluntarily" allow the power company to
interrupt their
 power supply in times of peak demand.

 Too bad.

 The heat of summer combined with continuing strong economic activity has,
in fact,
 resulted in widespread interruptions throughout California.

 And there is a precedent for how such interruptions can have both a
statistical and real
 impact on production: the San Francisco earthquake of October 1989.

 That quake disrupted electricity generation, particularly south of the city
in Silicon
 Valley. Largely as a result of that disruption, national industrial
production declined by
 0.5% (0.6% in manufacturing) in October 1989.

 The computer and semiconductor chip producers in Silicon Valley and
elsewhere in the
 state are very heavy users of electricity. It is reasonable to expect that
their total
 consumption of electricity, and their output, have skyrocketed since 1989.

 This industry has a twofold importance to the rest of the national economy.


 First, chips are essential inputs to the production of other industries
from "smart chips"
 in cars to central processing units for computers. Thus, a bottleneck in
chip supplies
 because of electricity interruptions could have ripple effects beyond
California.

 Second, chip production is among the highest value-added activities in the
U.S.
 economy - each stage of production adds significantly to the value of total
output. This
 means that the specific shock impact on this industry could have a greatly
magnified
 effect on overall economic activity.

 The usage is not confined to chip production, however. An extensive range
of other
 California-based industries - from chemicals to textiles - have intensive
electricity usage
 in their production.

 Their production will be estimated lower because of the reduction in
electricity. And in
 fact, real production will be lowered by a reduced electricity input.

 Ironically, these interruptions could complement the Fed's efforts to slow
economic
 activity and take some of the pressure off for further rate increases. What
infuriates
 Californians might actually be a welcome development for the rest of us.

Attention IT and Scheduling Personnel
Your participation is requested in the  Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid Market
Simulation.

As previously announced, the ISO has scheduled for the first week of October
1, 2000 the implementation of Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bids.  Prior to this
implementation, a Market Simulation is being scheduled for all Market
Participants in order to provide for simulation on the use of this new
functionality.

Inter- SC Trade Adjustment Bid Market Simulation is scheduled to begin on
Tuesday, September 4, 2000.

The ISO will hold a kickoff meeting conference call on Thursday, August 31
from 2:00 - 3:00 p.m., to elicit participation and review the scope of this
Market Simulation.  During this conference call, we will also request
participants help in finalizing details of the Market Simulation Plan which
will be distributed to Market Simulation Participants by Friday.

All Market Participants are strongly urged to participate in this
simulation.

TSWG Meeting notes for 8/23/00


Participants:
Scheduling Coordinators - Altra, SCE, CDWR, PGE, Riverside, Southern,
Midway, Dynegy, PX, Reliant, NCPA, & more.
ISO - Darren Lamb, Ginger Seitles, Greg Ford, Eddie Ledesma, Mark Rothleder,
CP Ng, Jim Blatchford.

Settlement Dispute System (SDS):

Not implemented yet.

Automated Dispatch System (ADS):

The ADS Query File Data Dictionary was released this week. ADS client 26 was
released 8/23. Features include Query data which now contain decimals
instead of integer values and system performance improvement by limiting
queries to 7 days worth of data at a time. A question was raised about what
time standard is used for instructions. Greg Ford responded it is PDT/PST.

RMR Scheduling:

No comments

10-Minute Settlement:

The API parser had corrections made. The Ex-Post price fix (looking for 6
values instead of 1) has been implemented and is working. Also the
supplemental energy import parsing order was corrected. The Beep_Gen_Full
template does successfully parse through the existing parser. Ginger Seitles
is working with SCE to correct the localized parser problem. The question
was raised if there may be only one record supporting two charge types. CP
responded that for CTs 401/407 there is, and can be, one record supporting
multiple charge types. A question was raised concerning instructions being
over lapped to the next day. Mark responded that there are no instructions
that are issued to last over a day. Mark also reminded everyone that
effective June 1st that the ISO stated using ramping energy versus block
energy for dispatches. He also reminded all that residual energy would be in
effect on September 1st.  The PX asked if there were DC loss calculation
available for the market simulation information. CP stated that there was
and would forward it on to the PX. It is also planned to publish the
implementation schedule the week of 8/28.

InterSC Trades of Adjustment Bids:

The implementation target date for Inter-SC Trade Adjustment Bid has been
delayed until the first week of October 1, 2000. A new schedule has been
published. A training class has been tentatively scheduled for September
19th . Details to follow.

OASIS Redesign:

Darren Lamb explained that the project is progressing satisfactorily. He is
still anticipating a market testing in late October with full implementation
in mid-December. A concerned was raised about the amount of time, if any was
being allotted for overlapping of templates.

Dual Invoicing:

Everyone was reminded that the first preliminary invoices were coming out
8/24.

Other:

A request was made (after the TSWG call) to change the time of the call to
1330 PDT to accommodate those in the Eastern Time zone.  Comments are
requested.

Please send out the same information to Western traders.  We would like

  SC Settlements Contacts

  After the 10 Minute Settlement Market Simulation conference
call on Friday August 25,  Market Participants' concerns of readiness were
brought before the ISO Officers.  The Officers discussed these concerns as
well as the two previous delays (June and August) in implementing Ten Minute
Settlements.  Weighing all of these issues, the ISO believes that there is a
compelling need to put a pricing structure in place to realize a substantial
saving in real time energy costs.

  Therefore, the ISO has decided to continue with the Ten
Minute Settlement implementation date of September 1, 2000.

MARKET NOTICE
This Market Notification is to advise you of a misallocation of UFE that has
been identified in the SCE and Pasadena's UDC territories between the Trade
dates of April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000 .
On April 26, 2000 the ISO made a change to the ISO Masterfile that
eliminated the ability for SCs to submit a schedule at the intra-tie
resource ID for the Pasadena UDC territory. This change in turn, prevented
the meter data that was directly collected by the ISO at the intra-tie/load
point to be used in the Settlement calculations.
The effect of this change was that from Trade date April 27, 2000 until
corrected for Trade date June 28, 2000 the UFE calculation was performed
without the proper data representing the intra-tie point between the SCE and
Pasadena UDC territories. This caused UFE to be more positive in the SCE UDC
territory and more negative in the Pasadena UDC territory.  The UFE
calculation used the appropriate meter data, for Trade dates June 28, 2000
forward .
The ISO is in process of determining the method to reallocate the UFE for
the period between Trade dates April 27, 2000 and June 27, 2000. The
magnitude of the misallocation is estimated at approximately $14.5 Million .

Further notification to the Market will be made after the ISO determines the
reallocation method and timeline .

Version: 4.3,      Effective Date: 8-25-00
Changes / Reasons: updated for the increased Path 26 OTC
Procedure Purpose: This Operating Procedure describes limits on Southern
California imports based on the parameters of the East-of-River/Southern
California Import Transmission Nomogram (SCIT) for the 2000 Summer season
(Effective June 7, 2000).
The East-of-River/Southern California Import Transmission (SCIT) Nomogram

(WOR) Nomogram.

ISO Operating Procedure posted:  T-116 NORTHERN CA TRANSFER Nomogram (AC-DC)
Version: 3.5,      Effective Date: 8-25-00
Changes / Reasons: updated for the increased Path 26 OTC
Procedure Purpose: The purpose of the COI/NW-Sierra and PDCI north-to-south
operating Nomogram (AC/DC Nomogram) is to operate in conformance with the
WSCC Minimum Operating Reliability Criteria (MORC) and to protect the WSCC
system during heavy export conditions from the Northwest to the Southwest
from disturbances similar to those that occurred on July 2 and August 10,
1996.  The Nomograms are based on the loss of the Bipolar PDCI, a 2-unit
loss at Palo Verde, a 2-unit loss of Moss Landing, or a Table Mountain South
Double Line Outage.  The Nomograms are limited by post-transient Outages.

Bob,
Wanted to say hello. My trip to Ireland and England
was a blast. Had a good time in both countries. A lot
of history blah, blah, blah. Been with the first
Marines for about two weeks and I am beginning to
figure my way around. Working out every day and
running (on my own) a great deal. Do not want to be
the wimp of the bunch. Should be fun two years with a
lot of training which will culminate with a deployment
to WestPac next year sometime and thats it.

Otherwise thing are good for me. I will be heading bck
to NY for the third week in Sept to attend a wedding
of my HS friend Gary. You probably remember him. Will
be home for a week. First time since I left Med
school. Taking my girlfriend with me back home. She
has already met the Rat in Vegas. She also met Gary
and his bride to be when they came out here for  a
week in the winter.

Hope all is well with you. Any little Bobs in the
future? Stay in touch and I hope the Yankees can hold
on and the Knicks finally unload the old man. Now,
there is no way they can compete with Miami.

Later,
Fran
