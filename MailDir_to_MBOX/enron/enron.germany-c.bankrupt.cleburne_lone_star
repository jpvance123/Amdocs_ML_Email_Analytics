Things should be back to normal on Friday.  You will be able to start
burning off your imbalance again on Saturday unless the line pressure is
too low.  It may take us a while to build the pressure back up on Line X
again.

Just checking to see if things are going back to normal for Friday, the
10th.  I would like to start selling our imbalance gas again on Sat if
possible.

   Thanks.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/30/02 at $3.24, that wraps up the sales for April 2002.

Theresa, I've attached my worksheet showing how much we sold TXU for April and what price.  The daily volumes are in column M and the daily prices are in column N.  We should bill TXU for 301,000 dth and a dollar amount of $952,055.00.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

Hey team.  We won't be selling TXU any gas probably until Saturday.

FYI, my good buddy Kevin Brady is going to start doing the nominations on Lone Star, just as soon as I can find where he's sitting.

The plant used 39,880 MMBtu yesterday (5/7/02) from 7:00 am to 7:00 am. I feel comfortable of nominating the entire 45,000 MMBtu, at least until and through Friday.

For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02.

Things should be back to normal on Friday.  You will be able to start
burning off your imbalance again on Saturday unless the line pressure is
too low.  It may take us a while to build the pressure back up on Line X
again.

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

Robin, Chris & Ed:

There are actually two agreements in place. The first is an Agency agreemen=
t (the one you have) with PPEP and Enron. For a fee of about $0.04/MMBtu, E=
nron does all of the activities associated with gas deliveries, nominations=
, scheduling and re-marketing of the gas for that plant. You are correct, i=
t was never signed but is still being used.

The second agreement is a Management Services Agreement between PPEP and En=
ron. This agreement is for all other activities such as accounting, legal, =
environmental, etc.I believe any personnel hours are billed back based on t=
his agreement. Rick Hill will inform you of more details and should have a =
copy. This one has been executed.

Ed,

Rick is out of the office until the 13th.  I am meeting with him at 10:00 o=
n the 13th.  I had a conversation with Mike Mazowita at White Pines Energy.=
  Mike
is the liason between the plant and ENA.  He informed me that Ponderosa Pin=
es Energy Partners (the plant) and ENA have a management agreement.=20
He said that ENA gets reimbursed based on time spent on behalf of the plant=
.  Apparently the agreement was never executed but the two companies
transacted as if it was executed.  I am out this afternoon and Paul Darmitz=

 if the estate can be reimbursed for hours ENA employee spend on behalf of =
the plant.=20

Yes it is, and we will try Rick.  However, I assumed this was part of Op-Co=

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=

t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.

I'm out on Monday.

I didn't sell any gas for the 1st through the 3rd.  

Lone Star is doing some pigging for the 4th, 5th, and 6th and its going to have and impact on our supply.  Kevin has been in touch with Cinergy and Williams.

Robin, I don't know if you will be able to sell any gas during the outage.  Check with Mike to see what he wants to do, then check with Kevin to see where the gas is coming in at.  I left the contracts on your desk and I will call you Monday morning.

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=
al make sure that liability to Enron under the fuel  management deal be ful=
ly understood.  We are doing what we can to minimize penalties or costs, bu=
t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=

Subject:=09ponderosa plant service events for gas days june 4, 5, 6


Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

  Have the Ponderosa volumes on Williams and Apache been nominated for June, 2002  ?  

  We want to take the full volumes under each contract: 25,000 MMBtu - Williams and 20,000 MMBtu for Apache. 

Is there a nom due for Lonestar also??

The plant used 39,880 MMBtu yesterday (5/7/02) from 7:00 am to 7:00 am. I feel comfortable of nominating the entire 45,000 MMBtu, at least until and through Friday.

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

Ed,

Rick is out of the office until the 13th.  I am meeting with him at 10:00 o=
n the 13th.  I had a conversation with Mike Mazowita at White Pines Energy.=
  Mike
is the liason between the plant and ENA.  He informed me that Ponderosa Pin=
es Energy Partners (the plant) and ENA have a management agreement.=20
He said that ENA gets reimbursed based on time spent on behalf of the plant=
.  Apparently the agreement was never executed but the two companies
transacted as if it was executed.  I am out this afternoon and Paul Darmitz=
el is out this afternoon.  I am going to get Paul involved on Monday to see=
 if the estate can be reimbursed for hours ENA employee spend on behalf of =
the plant.=20

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=

t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

Chris,

Can you help Karen out here???

	1) Is there a TXU Settlements person we can talk to regarding this difference in payment??? 

	2) At one time, you were contemplating putting our deal into the "system". Did this happen and are invoices being generated 	from this system?? 

MM

Mike, on May 29, a deposit was made into the Chase account in the amount of $925,244.97.  Would this be the deposit from TXU for April's gas sales?  According to Chris's schedule, they owed us $952,055 for April.  Any thoughts or comments?

Thanks,

ps:  who is invoicing TXU for what they owe us?

, scheduling and re-marketing of the gas for that plant. You are correct, i=
t was never signed but is still being used.

The second agreement is a Management Services Agreement between PPEP and En=

environmental, etc.I believe any personnel hours are billed back based on t=

Ed,

Rick is out of the office until the 13th.  I am meeting with him at 10:00 o=
n the 13th.  I had a conversation with Mike Mazowita at White Pines Energy.=
  Mike
is the liason between the plant and ENA.  He informed me that Ponderosa Pin=
es Energy Partners (the plant) and ENA have a management agreement.=20
He said that ENA gets reimbursed based on time spent on behalf of the plant=
.  Apparently the agreement was never executed but the two companies
transacted as if it was executed.  I am out this afternoon and Paul Darmitz=

 if the estate can be reimbursed for hours ENA employee spend on behalf of =
the plant.=20

Yes it is, and we will try Rick.  However, I assumed this was part of Op-Co=
 or an ENA asset in your world.  I think Rick is doing power terminated boo=

I do not know which, if any, of you guys is the right one to note this, but=
 I wanted to forward for the appropriate person's attention.  If not you, c=
ould you please advise me of the right Enron person.

That said, I recommend that the person within Enron responsible for this de=

t we are quite limited in options due to the bankruptcy.  Please let me kno=

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx
chris

Jeff, 

For May 2002, Ponderosa Pines is electing to take 25,000 per day.  Please confirm receipt of this email.  We are moving today so I will be out of the office for the rest of the day.  FYI, Sabra Dinari is the scheduler and Kathy Kelly is my backup.  Sabra's number is 713-853-9781 and Kathy's number is 713-853-5858.

TXU LSP is requesting that you not bring in additional gas over what you
are currently burning.  The imbalance on the Ponderosa Pine contract is
growing extremely large.

Chris,

The last two days the consumption at the plant has been 42,085 MMBtu and 38,852 MMBtu. These are plant reads based on 7am-7am timeframe. Do we need to sell an additional 5,000 MMBtu in order to pull more off of Lonestar??

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

I want to send out an email showing the TXU sales for the month.  I'm going to copy TXU and kinda use this as an informal confirmation of the monthly activity.  I just want to verify that it is Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd. billing TXU correct?

Also, have we received payment for Feb yet?  If not, I would question whether TXU is really going to pay, its starting to sound like a stall technique.  If we need someone else to sell the gas too, we might set up contracts with Apache and Williams and start selling the gas back to them.  Then you would at least have some purchases to net the sales with.

Just a thought before I hop off to lunch.

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't=
 need. =20


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is runnin=
g a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. A=
pparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparti=
es the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar=09rep =
said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system =
was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's supp=
liers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day =
June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45M=
M, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Ci=
nergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said t=
hey would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's =
flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.=20

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I =
also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant ca=
n burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not w=
ant to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that =
I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as levera=
ge with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back t=
he plant.  I told him that I =09wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically =
but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a =
plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not =
they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve=
.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  Th=
e way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right =
to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of pri=
mary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contr=
act gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas in=
to Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transporta=
tion agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is oblig=
ated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yeste=
rday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at=
 Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  T=
om indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have =
a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some =
of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that =09my primary concern w=
as flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a =
force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret=09the force majuere lan=
guage that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line =
breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provis=
ion for transportation interruption. =20

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the op=
erational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the =
=09financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told =
him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was min=
imal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to th=
e pipe cutting back their gas supply.=20

   =20
Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 1=
2.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at =
Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for Ju=
ne 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 =
after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably fo=
r the remainder or in a day. =20

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed=
 to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn =
rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transp=
ortation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10=
pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see w=
hen the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could=
 bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike =
to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would b=
e over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that coul=
d help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressu=
re had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy a=
nd Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point. =
 Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she wou=
ld let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and=
 the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said t=
hat they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested=
 meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy =
the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines a=
nd ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy =
the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the n=
om.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and =
requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I d=
idn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they coul=
d not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off eve=
n 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting ever=
ything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get =
them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the co=
ntract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my pro=
posal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We=
 agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after =
the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to com=
e from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.=
 =20

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle=
 and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the sa=
me as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make u=
p the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green=
 at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to =
HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the poin=
t.  I requested that =09Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neith=
er of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparti=
es.  We will have to address the =09issue intraday if necessary.
=09
I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

Karen, I thought you guys were creating a manual invoice and sending it out the door.  We can put all of this activity in our gas system for tracking and g/l purposes ( I think).  I have not worried about it because I thought this activity was going away, or at least out of the Estate Team area where Robin Barbe and I work.

I keep wondering if this activity should go to Greg Sharps group (OpCo or New Co, whatever its called)?

The accounting contact at TXU is Mydra Derden and her number is 214-875-9473.

Chris,

Can you help Karen out here???

	1) Is there a TXU Settlements person we can talk to regarding this difference in payment??? 

	2) At one time, you were contemplating putting our deal into the "system". Did this happen and are invoices being generated 	from this system??

Mike, on May 29, a deposit was made into the Chase account in the amount of $925,244.97.  Would this be the deposit from TXU for April's gas sales?  According to Chris's schedule, they owed us $952,055 for April.  Any thoughts or comments?

Thanks, 
Karen

ps:  who is invoicing TXU for what they owe us?

I just spoke with Theresa Vos.  She handles the accounting for these deals and she said they have to do everything outside the system because ENA is not collecting the slaes revenue or making the payments to the suppliers.  Joe was very concerned about putting deals in Sitara because he was afraid that we might double bill TXU.  There is also a problem with the Feb activity because TXU recorded all the activity as ENA activity instead of Ponderosa Pine activity.  It also appears that TXU withholds payments for the smallest indiscretions in the billing too.  We can chat about that next week.

Sabra, do you know what points Apache/Cinergy and Williams is giving us the gas at?  I'd like to see that if possible.

Thanks

I'm taking off Friday.

yes, I am basically handling any "old" wholesale business which for now includes the FGT/Citrus, Lonestar and some Enron Compressor stuff on TW.  I do have a Sitara ticket that we are updating for the sale to TXU, just let me know the price and I'll update it.  I'm updating the supply tickets, I believe its a long term deal...I don't know all the details about all this.  Is Joe Parks leaving or something, why are you doing all this stuff now?

FYI:  I call it the Cleburne Plant and it is at the same point as it was for the first 3 days of the month.  The scheduler over there calls me every morning to verify.

Sabra

I don't know if I should call this the Ponderosa Pine plant, the Cleburne Plant, or what.  Think I'll refer to it as Cleburne.

Sabra, Joe Parks told me that you handling Lone Start in the future.  

I sold 10,000 dth to TXU for tomorrow.  I believe we have sold TXU 10,000 dth everyday this month so far.  Lyn at TXU asked me if the gas was at the same point for tomorrow and I told her "sure" and I have no idea what points our gas is coming from.

I don't know how much time we need to spend on this.  But, I have not put anything in Sitara and I don't know if I should.  I believe Theresa Voss's (on 3 in Enron Center South) group is handling the accounting for this and I don't know what they need.  I'm going to try and meet her today.

Sabra, are you handling this?  Let me know.  If you are, do you want/need/care if this is in Sitara and Unify?  I believe all of the activity for this deal flowed through ENA before bankruptcy.  Now, I believe the partnership makes all the payments and billings and they probably pay ENA a fee.  Joe made it very clear that ENA is NOT supposed to send out an invoice.

thx

The nominations are due by April 29th at 2:00 P.M.  Also you need to know
that on May 7th through May 9th, TXU LSP will be replacing a piece of our
Line X Pipeline just to the east of the Ponderosa plant.  This means that
what gas you bring in from West Texas will have to match pretty much what
you burn.  Since this part of the pipeline will be cut off from the rest of
the pipeline there will be no way to handle swings in usage on the pipeline
during this time period.

I you have any questions please give me a call at 214-875-5185.

Theresa Vos tells me that she receives invoices directly from the suppliers and also receives an estimate of where the invoices should be from Justin Fernandez.  She says the two have reconciled closely since she's been responsible for payment (she picked this up in the Jan-Feb timeframe), with actuals usually coming in below Justin's estimates.  Accordingly, she has paid the invoiced amounts directly to the supplier without further reconcilliation.

Based on the above, should I be concerned with the "settlements" process?

Sold 10,000 dth of Conger gas to TXU for 4/30/02 at $3.24, that wraps up the sales for April 2002.

Theresa, I've attached my worksheet showing how much we sold TXU for April and what price.  The daily volumes are in column M and the daily prices are in column N.  We should bill TXU for 301,000 dth and a dollar amount of $952,055.00.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thanks

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Ed, we have been looking at the best alternatives for addressing all aspects of this deal, including the gas agreement. Rick Hill & I will explain where we are in general & w.r.t. The gas agreement. We can then followup with the cornhusker deal team on your concerns as we need to meet for an update on a course of action independent of this concern.

Chris,

Can you reattach the file that Jeff sent. I believe it is the imbalance schedule I was looking for!

Also, looking for some historical info. Did Joe Parks leave any history with regards to transactions in December or January?? Specifically, did Ponderosa through Enron sell any gas to third parties in those months??

MM

Donna, I did the noms for the 1st but I think I would like you guys to take over.  Robin is going to handle this while I'm out and she won't be doing the nominations.

Mike, Rick,  this activity is currently being handled outside our normal gas systems (Sitara and Unify).  I would like to get our gas systems set up to handle this activity as opposed to doing everything manually like we are now.  I spoke briefly with Scott Mills yesterday and he agrees with me that it should be in the system.  Do you have any idea how long this activity will be around?

Thanks

To:=09McMichael Jr., Ed
Cc:=09Bills, Lisa; Lyons, Dan; Ward, Charles; Barbe, Robin
Subject:=09Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners, Ltd ("PPEP")

After I learned that Robin was preparing a summary to bring you up to speed=
 with where we are gas-wise w/PPEP, I offered to draft something that might=
 help put us all on the same page and allow her to work on other things imp=
ortant to your group.

PPEP owns a 263 MW plant located in Cleburne, TX.  The plant has three gas-=
related agreements that require daily management:  (1) a gas transportation=
 agreement w/Lone Star, (2) a gas supply agreement w/Apache (which is being=
 managed by Cinergy), and (3) a gas supply agreement w/Williams.  Prior to =
June 30, 2000, these agreements were administered under a service agreement=
 between PPEP (f/k/a Tenaska IV Texas Partners, Ltd., or "TIVTP") and Tenas=
ka Gas Co.  Under that agreement, Tenaska Gas Co. ("TGC") provided scheduli=
ng services, reconciled gas activity to invoices, and bought and sold gas o=
n behalf of TIVTP.  As consideration for services provided, TGC received a =
per unit fee that (if the agreement were still in effect) would have amount=
ed to approximately $0.0513/Dth in 2002.  That fee is prevalent in the PPA =
as it relates to Brazos' gas purchase options and electric pricing after 20=
06, the year the gas supply agreements expire.

The TGC gas agreement was terminated on June 30, 2000 at which time Pondero=
sa Pine Energy, LLC ("PPE"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Delta Power Co., =
LLC ("DPC"), acquired all of the entities that own general partnership inte=
rests (90%) in TIVTP (whose name changed to PPEP one year later).  Just pri=
or to PPE's acquisition, ENA acquired the only limited partnership interest=
 (10%) from LG&E.  In conjunction with PPE's acquisition, ENA entered into =
two service agreements with PPE:  (1) a Consulting Services Agreement, unde=
r which either party receives cost plus 5% for services rendered (there has=
 been no business conducted under this agreement, and (2) a Corporate Servi=
ces Agreement, under which ENA is entitled to receive cost plus 5% for acco=
unting, tax, finance, legal, and HR services it provides to PPE.

PPE's purchase agreement provided for a transition of gas services to ENA o=
ver 90 days.  In conjunction with the transition, ENA and PPE developed (bu=
t never executed) a gas agency agreement under which the ENA Texas Desk pro=
vided services similar to those provided under the TGC gas service agreemen=
t.  Per Weil, course of performance is sufficient to consider that agreemen=
t binding as a "verbal arrangement".  Under that verbal arrangement, the EN=
A Texas Desk received a fee of $0.0400/Dth in 2001; by our calculations, th=
at fee has increased to $0.0406/Dth in 2002.  PPE is current through Novemb=
er 2001 on the payment of these fees.

In addition to the status of the PPE-ENA gas agency agreement, two issues w=
ere raised to a consciousness level shortly after the filing of our petitio=
n =20

In what appears to be related to the sale of HPL to AEP, payments that were=
 made by PPEP to ENA for further payment to Lone Star between April and Nov=
ember 2001 were never remitted by ENA to Lone Star.  In order to prevent th=
e Lone Star agreement from going into default, PPEP was forced to pay Lone =
Star directly (effectively causing PPEP to "double pay" its transportation =
costs for the period). =20

Revenue that was received by ENA for the resale of gas on behalf of PPEP (i=
.e., due to an electric production schedule that didn't utilize full contra=
ct entitlements) for the month of November was never remitted to PPEP.

Taken together, these two items create a $1.3 MM claim against ENA by PPEP.=
  Additionally, we learned shortly after the bankruptcy that the electric p=
roduction schedule had lead to the development of a large imbalance on the =
Lone Star pipeline.  Given ENA's limited capability to transact on physical=
 gas (and Lone Star's physical limitations), it has been difficult to work =
off this imbalance.  However, the fact that the plant is generally short ga=
s in summer production months (i.e., the plant utilizes approximately 48,00=
0 Dth/d at full production vs. its 45,000 Dth daily contract entitlements),=
 the imbalance should start to reverse this summer.  It's my understanding =
that the facility has fairly liberal balancing provisions w/Lone Star.

An invoice for gas agency services since the filing of the bankruptcy was p=
resented to PPE today.  Based on conversations that I had w/DPC earlier thi=
s year, we suspect (due to the limited capacity in which ENA can perform an=
d the claim described above) that PPE will decline to pay the invoice.  ENA=
, at DPC's request, developed an RFP to solicit bids for a new gas agency s=
ervice provider earlier this year.  While we have received no indications t=
hat the RFP has been issued, it is my understanding that DPC has had conver=
sations with one or more parties that may be willing to provide gas agency =
services.  While not crucial to ENA's decision-making, we have no way of kn=
owing how these conversations have progressed or if DPC is presently in a p=
osition to assume the role of gas portfolio manager. =20

However, this is deal falls into the "SPE category" by virtue of a total re=
turn swap between ENE and KBC bank, which loaned PPE 97% of the total funds=
 needed to acquire the entities that own general partnership interests in P=
PEP.  The total return swap was entered into contemporaneously with PPE's a=
cquisition in June 2000.  The total return swap agreement appears to be in =
default; ENE has not performed under that agreement since the bankruptcy fi=
ling.  Likewise, the KBC-PPE loan agreement also appears to be in default. =
 We are aware that DPC attempted to put its equity interests in PPE back to=
 KBC in December under the loan agreement, and that its exercise lead to th=
e filing of a lawsuit by KBC.  We are also aware that KBC and DPC are in di=
scussions concerning a resolution of their differences and a possible restr=
ucturing of the investment, but we have not (to date) been party to those d=
iscussions.  Lisa Bills is responsible for the total return swap and bank t=
he bank relationship on this deal.  She is presently developing a strategy =
document for dealing with this investment (which appears to the deal team t=
o be a net liability due to the current market for power plant investments =
and the relationship with Brazos). =20

Because the SPE status (and outright ownership of the limited partnership i=
nterest), we intend to continue in our collective service roles (i.e., rely=
ing on DPC for authorization of our decisions) until such time that the str=
ategy can be advanced through the approval process.   Lisa views DPC's reac=
tion to the gas agency service fee invoice to be a key part of this process=
.

I hope this helps...please let me know if you need more.

Kevin, Robin, I don't think there were any supply interruptions for May 2002.  Please let me know if I missed something.  Theresa just needs to know the total volume purchased.

Thanks.

Supply from Williams 775,000 dth

Jeff,

     I have two questions for you, first, are you having an issue with your phone line?..each time I try and call one of the nomination contacts I get a constant busy tone?? Secondly, and more importantly, we received word that L-Star was going to smart pig the line?..this is the message we received?can you confirm it? If so how will it impact us?

TXU LSP is planning to perform smart pig maintenance activities on Line X
Gas Day June 18 (Tuesday) and Gas Day June 21 (Friday).  Gas Days June 19
and 20 will be normal flow days, and the weekend of June 22 - 24 will be
normal flow days.  The portion of the line that is to be maintained is the
same portion as the maintenance earlier this month. Please contact your
representatives if there are any questions.


Kevin Brady

  Have the Ponderosa volumes on Williams and Apache been nominated for June, 2002  ?  

  We want to take the full volumes under each contract: 25,000 MMBtu - Williams and 20,000 MMBtu for Apache. 

Is there a nom due for Lonestar also??

Chris, we prepared an invoice for Feb, but not for March or April, and somehow we still got paid.  It's no problem for us to invoice TXU, though, if we need to.  It's probably better that way, since it's not Enron that's getting paid here.

Karen, I thought you guys were creating a manual invoice and sending it out the door.  We can put all of this activity in our gas system for tracking and g/l purposes ( I think).  I have not worried about it because I thought this activity was going away, or at least out of the Estate Team area where Robin Barbe and I work.

I keep wondering if this activity should go to Greg Sharps group (OpCo or New Co, whatever its called)?

The accounting contact at TXU is Mydra Derden and her number is 214-875-9473.

Can you help Karen out here???

	1) Is there a TXU Settlements person we can talk to regarding this difference in payment??? 

	2) At one time, you were contemplating putting our deal into the "system". Did this happen and are invoices being generated 	from this system??

Mike, on May 29, a deposit was made into the Chase account in the amount of $925,244.97.  Would this be the deposit from TXU for April's gas sales?  According to Chris's schedule, they owed us $952,055 for April.  Any thoughts or comments?

Thanks, 
Karen

ps:  who is invoicing TXU for what they owe us?

Kathy & Chris:

I just received the nomination from Brazos for the Ponderosa Pine plant. For Monday & Tuesday (4/8 & 4/9) they are estimating to run the plant at a level that will burn approximately 43,000 MMBtu/day.

If you have sold Monday's gas, don't change anything. I probably would not sell Tuesday's gas just for the sake of trying to stay on the good side of Lonestar.

Call me at (248) 813-1063 if there are any questions.

Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.

Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.
