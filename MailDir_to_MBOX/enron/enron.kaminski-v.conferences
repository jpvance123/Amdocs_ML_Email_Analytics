Subject: Dinner speaker - May  23


Shirley,

This is to follow up today's  conversation with Anita. As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our  dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24. On 
reflection given the strong line up for  Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on  Wednesday. This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong  incentive to be 
there for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change  should be acceptable to Vince. 

We will show Vince's name as  follows:



Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director -  Research

ENRON



Jeremy will be em ailing you the program  with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press  today. Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow. We would very much appreciate  your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes. If you would respond  to all of us it would be 
appreciated.

Hello all,

The program for the 2000 Texas Finance Festival has been formalized and can
be found on our web site at

http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/martinj/festival2.html

I do need to remind you of a few things before we converge on San Antonio.
First, be sure to contact the convention hotel and make your reservations.
At last count there were only 6 rooms left.  Second, I need a completed
application form from everyone so that we can get an accurate meal count.
I am attaching the program announcement so you can fill out the appropriate
boxes for meals and numbers of guests in the event you have not sent in a
form.

Remember that we are starting the conference off with a luncheon on Friday
so plan on arriving early Friday or coming in on Thursday evening if you
can.  Our hotel is right on the river and there are lots of restaurants and
interesting things to visit in the immediate area (the Alamo is across the
plaza from the hotel).

We are making plans for spouses and children to attend both the dinner on
Friday and Saturday evenings.  The Friday evening dinner begins at 6 p.m.
so that we can be done in plenty of time for our private guided tour of the
Alamo at 8:00 p.m.  For Saturday we are still working out plans for the
evening so stay tuned.

There will be more information later as the conference nears.  Looking
forward to seeing you all and in beautiful, sunny San Antonio.

John

Dear Vince,
?
I hope you are well. I am leaving Risk at the  end of next week and before I 
leave I am producing the mathematics for energy  derivatives training course. 
I have written a programme and attached it to this  email and I wondered 
whether you could have a look at it and let me know what  you think. I also 
wondered whether you would be interested in speaking at the  course.
?
I will give you a call on Monday to  it.
?
Best regards,
?
Vicky

Dear Vince,

I apologise for sending another email.  I was wondering if you could confirm 
your talk title (plus some bullet points) for your presentation at our Annual 
US Congress.  I have attached a condensed programme for the event - you are 
speaking on stream three, part of the new research in derivatives modelling 
and analysis section.
Unfortunately we are printing the brochure at the end of the week and will 
need these details by thursday 27 January.

Best regards,

Vince: 

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to 
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael 
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th 
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining 
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the 
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a 
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and 
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a 
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from 
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check 
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the 
following website URL: 

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm 

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an 
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key 
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone 
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power 
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would 
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but 
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would 
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes, 
followed by a short Q&A period. 

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of 
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price 
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy 
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives 
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it 
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event. 

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether 
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event. 
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in 
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if 
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Paul

Dear Vince,

I hope you are well and that things round at Enron aren't too hectic. It is
my pleasure to invite you to speak at Energy & Power Risk Management
Magazine Conferences' new event, Australian Energy 2000, addressing the
second Industry Briefing - "Learning from US experience: Lessons to be
learned from the restructuring North American markets". I appreciate that
you are speaking a lot for us at the moment (for which I am of course
grateful) but, when researching, yours was a name that came up repeatedly
as someone the market would like to hear from. I am hoping that perhaps you
might need to see Paul Quilkey at some point in July and that we can
provide you with another reason to cross the globe.

Rather like the industry briefing that you are giving at Power 2000 this
year in Houston, this address will be presented to the entire conference
before breaking into their streams.

Australian Energy 2000 will take a focused look at the latest problems
facing energy players, with the two in-depth streams I mentioned above: one
dedicated to energy pricing and trading and the other looking at risk
management and the latest business issues.

This conference will be of the highly technical level that people have come
to expect from EPRM events, and I am very keen to encourage participation
from speakers in modifying the programme to suit the audience and issues at
hand. If you have any suggestions or comments on the programme, please let
me know; any help would be gratefully received.

This event will be thoroughly marketed through both Energy & Power Risk
Management Magazine and our extensive database. It is my aim to attract the
leading market players by providing a first-class programme with top-rated
speakers, making this a highly worthwhile event for the energy industry.

I have attached a copy of the programme for your information.

Unfortunately my schedule for this event is very tight. Please let me know
if you would like to participate by reurn email as it is unlikely that we
can speak on the phone as I am currently based in Hong Kong. If you would
like to send a colleague, then I would be happy to discuss this but it
would be great if you could complete the EPRM grand slam by addressing our
three major annual events on three different continents!

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Yours sincerely,

Joel Hanley

Dear Mr. Kaminski,

I have just spoken with Phelim Boyle, who was very pleased to report that
you will be speaking at our Energy Derivatives Conference in Toronto on May
29.

I understand that the title of your presentation is "Current Challenges in
Pricing and Risk Management of Energy Derivatives."  Would you also be
available and willing to join a panel discussion/question and answer period
at the end of the day?

Speakers, with tentative titles, to follow you are:

Corwin Joy (Positron, Houston)
"Modeling physical assets: real option theory applied to generation assets"
David Emanuel (Williams, Tulsa)
"Modeling issues in power markets"
Shijie Deng (Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta)
"Research on pricing electricity derivatives and the basic models"
Melanie Cao (Queen's University, Kingston Ontario)
"Equilibrium pricing of weather derivatives"
Panel discussion

Perhaps Ms. Crenshaw could send me your short biographical sketch, by email
or fax (519) 888-7562 so that I can proceed with promoting this event as
soon as possible.

Many thanks,

Amy

Vince,

 I understand you'll be speaking at the CEFER conference. Gary Taylor, the 
head of marketing in the Weather Deriv. group, would like to know if you plan 
on mentioning weather derivatives at all and that if you do, he has numerous 
existing slides and presentations that might be useful to you.

Dear Mr Kaminski,

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you
concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again
this year - brilliant!

I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper
again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your
contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.

To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical")
topics that are already covered:

Exotic Energy  Contracts

   multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
   adding jumps
   applying the models to  exotic energy options
   extensions to multiple  energy contracts

Gas  Supply Agreements

   Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA)
   Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS)

   Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures
   Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting;
   Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools:

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured
contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

Kind Regards,

Hello Helyette,

I am in California this week, vacationing with my family. It is a spring
break week at Stanford and we shall spend a few days in Calistoga, north of
Napa Valley, a place famous for mineral water and geysers.

I shall talk to Karla when I come back to Houston about the speeding up the
process on our side. Our lawyers typically sit on a contract for a few weeks
unless we put a lot of pressure on them. American lawyers tend to be very
meticulous: this is why the city of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than
entire Japan. I think about two sites for your software: Houston and Europe
(most likely London).

I shall be honored to chair a session during the Bachelier World Congress at
College de France. Please, let me know which session you have in mind for me.

The repeat the Francfort presentation in Paris on October 4 & 5 is fine with
me. I think the Frankfurt presentation went quite well and it will be nice to
work wih you and Alex again.

Regards


Vince

P.S.  I shall keep my office cell phone on all the time, in case you need to
call me: 713 410 5396

Steve

given the practitioner audience, I would prefer a less technical
presentation. Perhaps if you can talk about use of real options at Enron in
general, and then give some examples (graphically --no notation) of
diagrammatic representation might be good. Remember there are many talks
and the capacity of the audience to absorb notation, grammar, and technical
detail is limited.

How about a more generic title "Real Options at Enron?"

Please give me your title within Enron please

Mr. Vincent J. Kaminski 
Managing Director 
Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 

Dear Mr. Kaminski: 

I am pleased to invite you to join my CERA colleagues and me at our 20th 
annual Executive Conference, "Shooting the Rapids: Strategies and Risks for 
the Energy Future" to be held February 12-16, 2001 in Houston, Texas.? This 
is the premier international gathering offering senior executives new ideas, 
insights and strategic thinking on the issues facing the global energy 
industry.

I believe you will find the conference and related social events timely and 
of considerable value.? Our focus will be on the critical implications of the 
current market turmoil for energy strategies, investment, regulatory 
backlash, competitive dynamics, and industry structure.? Presentations cover 
all key regions and energy sectors -- oil, natural gas and power -- and their 
interconnections.? The conference is the centerpiece of CERAWeek, a full week 
of senior level meetings designed to foster exchange and learning, as well as 
informal interaction and networking.? Last year's participants included some 
1600 executives from over 57 countries.

Complete details on CERAWeek 2001 can be found at? 
http://www.cera.com/cfm/track/mc.cfm?p=670&c=2804? . To register, please go

register@cera.com; or call us at 1 (800) 879-2372 ext. 800 (outside the U.S.

Shirley,

This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
for the Wednesday. 

I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  

We will show Vince's name as follows:

 

Wincety J. Kaminski

Managing Director - Research

ENRON



Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.


We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any 
corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be 
appreciated.

Vince and Vasant,

I was asked by one of my advisors to be on a panel for the summer Power 
Engineering Society.  I stated that I couldn't divulge any information on 
modeling efforts at Enron but could give a general overview and cover my 
dissertation work.  He stated that he understood and other companies had 
expressed similar concerns.

I guess that I need your OK to attend this presentation and present.

Thanks,
Lance

Hi Vince,

 I am resending you this request by Dr. Jacque for a paper.  They are 
expecting something by Jan 22.  Should we sit down and decide on what to put 
in a short paper (I think their limit was 30 pages, but that is impossible -- 
I think a few pages should suffice).  

Regards, and happy new year,
 Vasant

Dear Dr. Shanboghe:

 I certainly understand that it would be difficult for you to
contribute a chapter. I thought of an alternative: would Dr. Kaminski be
willing to allow us to reprint his article (in an abridged form) on "Energy
Exotic Options" published in his excellent book "Managing Energy Price Risk"
as I would really like to have a contribution from Enron on energy
derivatives. Would you be willing to talk to Dr. Kaminski about my proposal ?

 In any event I appreciate your interest in the conference and I only
regret that hurricane Floyd prevented us from meeting in person.

 With very best wishes in the New Year/Millenium

Shijie,

I am sending you the abstract for my INFORMS presentation.

******************************************************************************

*****


The last three years were characterized by exceptionally high volatility of
the power prices in the US markets. The market developments have created a
number of unique challenges for energy industry economists. One immediate
question we have to answer is how to measure volatility of energy prices.
Although we can all agree that the prices in the power markets are
characterized by high variability, the traditional measures used in financial
economics (annualized standard deviation of log price returns) may not fit
well electricity prices. The second challenge is to explain the sources of
high price volatility and to answer the question to what extent it can be
attributed to problems that can be addressed in the long run. Such problems
include flaws in market design that allow some market participants to abuse
market power, limited availability and/or unequal access to transmission,
temporary shortages of generation capacity. Some factors underlying high
volatility of electricity prices may be of permanent nature and may be a
necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and expanded customer
choice.

Hi Vince,

I would like to invite you, or one of your staff, to be a speaker at
Infocast's upcoming conference "Market Price Volatility: How to Model,
Assess, and Manage Price Volatility in Today's Power Markets," scheduled for
May 10-12, 2000, in Chicago.  I am attaching a copy of the draft program
agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston
meeting a step farther by making this next session a more
technically-oriented meeting.

There are two spots you may wish to consider:

1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for
Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had
in mind for the case study.
2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for
Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you
a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call
me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.

I hope you can join us.

CASE STUDY GUIDELINES
1.   Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,
Southern California.

1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a
new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in
Pennsylvania.
2.   Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily
NYMEX
close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999.
3.   Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility
and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why
these models were considered. Candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally.
4.   Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation
criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,
Akaike information criterion.
5.   Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described.
6.   Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.
7.   If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.

Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case
study may include other things.

Please find attached the programs for the two back-two-back conferences on 
real options at UCLA (you may also download them from www.realoptions.org and 
www.rogroup.com ). The two conferences are separate but complementary events. 
The first conference, co-sponsored with Accenture and Morgan Stanley Dean 
Witter, on July 11-12, is a professional conference on Real Options Valuation 
in the Connected Economy: High Tech, Pharma, Energy, Corporate Valuation & 
Strategic/Portfolio Management. For information and online registration see 
www.rogroup.com.

The second is the 5th Annual International Conference on Real Options: Theory 
Meets Practice (the annual industry event where academics and practitioners 
get together to share the latest developments on theory and applications), 
co-organized with The Anderson School at UCLA on July 13-14. For information 
and online registration see www.realoptions.org

Between the two complementary events, we are pleased to present an extensive 
array of practitioner and cutting-edge academic presentations, sharing of 
experiences by corporate executives, and panel discussions by experts from 
leading organizations and universities. Our keynote speaker this year will be 
Eduardo S. Schwartz of UCLA. 

Interested participants must register for the conference online 
www.realoptions.org) and indicate hotel preferences by May 31 or ASAP.

We look forward to seeing you at this exciting event, and would appreciate if 
you share this with interested colleagues.

Vince,

Thanks for the abstract!  For the purpose of the conference program
listing, the conference organizers need a title and an abstract which is
longer than 50 words.  Based on the abstract that you sent me, I took the
liberty to make up a title and the 50-word abstract (attached below).
Please make changes as you feel necessary and send them back to me.  I'll
send them out to the organizers once I get your confirmation on this.

Title: Current Challenges in Modeling Power Price Volatility

Author: Dr. Vince Kaminski, Head of Quantitative Research, Enron Capital &
Trade Resources

Abstract:
The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
expanded customer choice.

 Dear Energy in Europe Speaker
As the conference in Berlin draw closer, I would like to remind you that we 
urgently need to receive a copy of your presentation materials by Friday, 
26th May 2000.
If you could please send me a hard copy of your talk text or copies of any 
slides you plan to use,  as soon as possible I would be most grateful. I am 
sure you are aware of the importance of documentation, even if you plan to 
speak off the cuff please try and supply at least an outline of your proposed 
speech. If this material doesn't reach me by 26th May I am afraid they will 
not form part of the delegate packs. You can send a hard copy either by post 
or fax to the above address and details or you can e-mail it to me at the 
following address: ttulsi@icbi.co.uk.
If you have already sent copies of your presentation then please ignore this 
fax. Should you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact me, and I 
look forward to seeing you in Berlin shortly.
Kind regards

Subject: Arthur Andersen 21st Annual Energy Symposium

It is with great pleasure that I invite you to Arthur Andersen's 21st Annual 
Energy Symposium.  This year's conference will be held December 7th and 8th 
at the Westin Galleria Hotel in Houston.  Arthur Andersen is offering a 
valuable program with many of the industries top executives speaking on 
industry wide applications.

 A few weeks ago some of you may have received information regarding the 
registration process.  However, due to the level of Enron's attendance, we 
have arranged to facilitate your group's registration.  If you would like to 
register or would like more information about the Symposium, please contact 
Sabrina Whaley at 853-7696 by October 31, 2000 or forward your completed 
registration form to her at EB2355.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been 
attached for your information.  The registration fee is $950 per person; 
however, in the past we have given Enron personnel interested in attending a 
50% discount.

We are excited about the upcoming Symposium and hope that you will be able to 
attend.

Subject:  Power Crisis in the West


Dear Vince,

I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding Grant Masson.  You informed me
that he is no longer an Enron employee.  I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.

I am inquiring because Infocast would like to have an Enron representative
speak at an upcoming conference entitled "Power Crisis in the West: Status
&
Outlook for Wholesale and Retail Markets".  Is there someone else at Enron
whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?

I have attached the program agenda for your review.  Knowing a bit about
Grant's expertise, I specifically wanted him to participate on the panel
"How Will Power Prices Play Out in 2001-2005?".  Please let me know if
there
is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or
others that may be of interest to Enron.

I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly
going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy
surrounding
the situation in San Diego.

Kind Regards,
Nia Mansell

If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, 
given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on 
driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient 
time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate 
plans or suggestions.

Thanks,
Martin

We are now following up with that mailing to identify remaining

I shall be glad to meet you. I am planning to attend the Energy Symposium
and we can meet on the location. If business keeps me at the office,

Vince,

I hope things are well with you and your family.

The reason for contacting you today is to let you know I will be in Houston 
next
week between Monday and Wednesday inclusive.  If there is an opportunity to 
meet
up, probably informally, it would be useful to discuss our continuing 
activities
in the areas of Strategy, Value and, increasingly, Real Options.

If you are attending our Energy Symposium, or can meet up, please contact me 
at
your convenience.  If we do meet, I would also like to introduce you to one of
our senior managers from Houston:  George E. Danner.  George is a member of 
our
US National Strategy team and part of our global network of specialists 
working
on real option pricing.

If I do not speak to you before tomorrow - happy Thanksgiving.

ALLAN

Hello friends,

Attached is the program announcement for the third edition of the Texas
Finance Festival to be held in San Antonio (once again).  You will note
that we have some new and fun entertainment lined up to accompany the
superb program put together by Sheridan Titman (and company).

You can help us by registering early so we have put a discount into the
registration fee if you get your registration form and check in by January
15, 2001.  However, We would really appreciate hearing from you ASAP if you
do plan to come via return e-mail.

Looking forward to seeing you all again in the spring.

John

Just a quick email to start some  discussion about the panel session you are 
involved in during Risk2000 in Boston  on 13 & 14 June.
?
Although I would welcome suggestions to the contrary, I would  prefer to go 
straight into the discussion rather than have a series of short  
presentations first. Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic 
areas  around which the moderator can lead the discussion - naturally for the 
better  discussions it's important to have varying views on similar subjects; 
similarly  it is often interesting to hear the panel's comments on one 
individual's more  specific area of knowledge.
?
Conseqently if you could return this email (to all panel  members) with 
topics you feel should be covered, any particular areas you would  personally 
like to focus on, any proposed changes to the actual panel structure,  and 
possibly additonal panel members you think should be there, that would be a  
good start. I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if 
anyone  has any suggestions, please let me know.

Dear All,
?
Would like to set a conference call to discuss  content for the panel 
discussion at Risk 2000 in Boston on 14 June. Perhaps I  can suggest 
wednesday 31 may at noon EST. I'm on London time and am quite  flexible if 
you would like to do earlier or indeed on another day.
?
The panellists are -
?
Vince Kaminski, Enron Corp
Richard Jefferis, Koch Energy Trading
Steven Bramlet, Aquila
?
The discussion topic is 'effectively applying  weather derivatives'
?
I think we need to establish a series of  questions around which to 
facilitate discussion. We currently don't have a  moderator and perhaps one 
of you could take this role on.
?
I look forward to hearing from you.
?
Thanks, Oliver

Vince.  Thanks for getting back to me.   I will have my secretary try to
set up something among the three of us.  Gary, as Vince cannot make a call
on Wednesday, I will have my assistant call you to try to find a suitable
time.  Rachel, Gary Jackson's phone number is 423 751 2593 and Vince
Kaminski's secretary's number is given below.

Dawn,

I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
The portions of my presentation
will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
plus examples of some
standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies.

I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
the deadline is.

Vince

All,

I will be giving a 40min presentation on the above topic at the EPRM Energy 
2000 conference in April. The bulletpoints are:

Balancing market risk and credit risk to achieve a reliable estimation of 
total risk
Incorporating market risk into a credit risk model
Calculating probability of default using credit risk and market risk
Refining business practice to reflect credit risk and market risk evaluations

My proposed approach is to quickly step through the practical process of 
modelling credit risk, resulting in measures for expected loss and 
credit-VAR; then show how default probs can be calculated using bond and 
equity data. Finally I'll describe how credit risk can be mitigated using 
credit derivatives - plugging EnronCredit.com of course.

Any other ideas for broad topics and/or specific points to mention will be 
appreciated. The presentation has to be submitted next week.

Many thanks,

Ben

                            INVITATION TO SPEAK




GARP 2001


The 2nd Annual Risk Management Convention


13(superscript: th) & 14(superscript: th) February, 2001 ? Marriott World
Trade  Center, New York


Dear Kaminski

Further to my telephone conversation today with your secretary, Shirley
Crenshaw, and on behalf of the Global Association of Risk Professionals,  I
have great pleasure in inviting you to speak at our 2(superscript: nd)
Annual  Risk Management Convention ? GARP 2001.

This event has rapidly establishing itself as the risk management
industry's  most important meeting point. GARP 2000 reflected the key
concerns of risk  management experts world-wide, with over 400 attendees in
its first year. Three  simultaneous streams address traditional pricing and
risk management techniques,  along with specialised streams addressing new
sectors, such as the corporate  world and the insurance industry. With a
speaker panel of over 55 senior and  executive financial professionals from
investment banks, regulatory bodies,  asset management firms, academics,
insurers/re-insurers, corporate and system  providers this is THE financial
risk management event of the year.

Key areas that this Convention will consider include Market Risk (stress
testing, liquidity, jump diffusion, EVT), Credit Risk (regulation,
modeling,  stress testing, credit portfolio management, credit
derivatives), Operational  Risk, (regulation, data, modeling, validation,
EVT) Advanced Asset &  Liability Management, Corporate/Energy Risk
Management and the Insurance &  Capital Markets.

>From my research and discussions with experts in this arena your name was
highly recommended as a speaker for this event. Below is the stream on
Corporate  / Energy Risk Management and I had in mind ONE of the sessions
below for you.  Also, the topic titles are provisional and I am open to
suggested  alterations.


Corporate/Energy Risk Management


   Modelling Corporate Risk ? Risk Management from a Shareholder Value
   Perspective

   Measuring Energy Risk ? Tackling Price Volatility, Adapting VaR,
   Scenario  Modelling and Regulatory Requirements

   Forward Pricing ? Construction of the Forward Curve, Correlations,
   Transparency Issues

   The Volatility Challenge ? Modelling Price Volatility and Examining the
   New Products Designed to Stabilise Volatility

   Energy Credit Risk Management

GARP is a not-for-profit, independent organisation of risk management
practitioners and researchers from leading financial institutions
world-wide.  GARP's mission is to facilitate the exchange of information,
developing  educational programs and promoting standards in the area of
financial risk  management. For more information please refer to our web
site: www.garp.com

I sincerely hope you will be able to accept this invitation and I look
forward to hearing from you in due course. Should you have any questions
please  do not hesitate to contact me, otherwise I will call you again on
to discuss  this further.

Best regards

Andreas

                      6th - 9th November  2001, Paris


Dear Mr Kaminski,

I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you
concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again
this year - brilliant!

I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper
again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your
contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.

To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical")
topics that are already covered:



Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of
Exotic Energy  Contracts

   multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts
   adding jumps
   applying the models to  exotic energy options
   extensions to multiple  energy contracts

Les  Clewlow: Valuation and Risk Management of Virtual Power Stations and
Gas  Supply Agreements

   Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA)
   Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS)
   Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's
   Risk Analysis of GSA's  and VPS's



Derek Bunn, Professor of Decision  Sciences, LONDON BUSINESS SCHOOL:
Analysing The Impact Of NETA On  Market Efficiency & Volatility In The UK
Energy  Market


Chris Harris,  Director of Market Development.Operations and Engineering,
INNOGY: Applying  Cutting-Edge Portfolio Management Theory In Order To
Optimise Your Risk Exposure

   Establishing  and valuing the key factors using a bottom up approach
   Looking at  the interconnection between key factors
   The treatment of the risk  of infrequent but high impact events

Peter  Nance, Principal, TEKNECON: Combining Power  Systems And Monte Carlo
Simulations For Effective  Pricing

Dan  Mansfeld, Head of Risk  Control,  VATTENFALL:  Assessing The Benefits
And Risks Of Using  Derivatives As Part Of Your Risk Management Strategy

Spyros  Maragos: Analysing New Approaches To Building Forward Curves From
Available  Market Data

Tamara  Weinert, Credit and Contracts  Manager, MIRANT  ENERGY:
Successfully Measuring & Managing Credit  Risk

   What is  Credit Risk?
   Major changes  in the industry and their impact on Credit Risk
   Effects of  new risk profiles on credit appetite: Credit analysis; Limit
   Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures
   Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting;
   Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools:
Combining  Counterparty and Portfolio Credit VaR Techniques

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured
contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001
speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)
would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else
that has not been covered  yet.

I look forward to hearing  from you,

Kind Regards,
Angelika  Staude

My name is Guillermo C?novas, and I am Regulatory and Government Affairs 
Director for Enron Am,rica del Sur (Argentina). 
I understand you spoke in a seminar that took place on May 9/10 where it was 
discussed: 1) effective power price modelling; 2) applying a real option 
approach for the valuation of power plants.
One consultant and researcher, who shares Enron's belief in open markets and 
competition (and therefore is helping us to open Argentine energy markets), 
asked me if we could send him a copy of the booklet or slides that you and 
other speakers presented during the seminar.
If this is feasible, I would appreciate if you could send a copy of the 
material to me at Enron Am,rica del Sur, located at: Av. Eduardo Madero 900 - 
Piso 17 (1106) - Buenos Aires - Argentina
Please, do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions or 
require further information. I can be reached  at the following number: 
5411-4891-3600

Sincerely,

Guillermo.

The GARP  2001 Convention & Exhibition
?
Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
I am writing concerning the GARP 2001  Convention, which will be held in New 
York between 13th and 14th  February, 2001. 
?
I realise that the Christmas break has meant delays  in sending me 
your?presentation, however, I will need to know when I am  likely to receive 
the presentation so as to make arrangements with the printers,  which are 
based in the US. I am sure you can appreciate that we will need  several 
weeks before the event to collate and print the documentation for the  
delegates. The fact that there are over eighty speakers in four  days means a 
massive logistical task, which needs to be organized  soon.
?
I have therefore set a deadline of  Friday 5th January, 2001. After this date 
GARP can  not guarantee that documentation will be printed and placed in the  
delegate packs. (Please also bear in mind when organising the presentation, 
for  diagrams and charts, that the printing will be in pure?black and  white. 
Please also indicate what audio-visual requirements you may  have: 
35mm?slides; OHP; LCD  projection).
?
Also, if required, please do not forget to book  your hotel accommodation, as 
rooms will not be reserved for GARP speakers and  delegates after the middle 
of January. Attached is a hotel booking  form for your convenience.
?
If you have any questions or queries please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
though I will be out of the office until 2nd January,  2001.
?
Finally, I would like to wish you a wonderful  Festive Season and a happy & 
prosperous New Year. Looking forward to meeting you in New York in February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
The program for the GARP 2001  Convention is nearly printed and I will be 
sending you a few copies of  the program in the next few days. In the 
meantime, you can find the program on  our web site at www.garp.com
?
In addition, I am writing to inquire whether your  organisation can establish 
a web link to our program through your organisations'  web site. Below is the 
information that is of most importance and that I would  like included:
?
GARP 2001 - 2nd Annual Risk?  Management Convention & Exhibition, February 
12th to 15th February,  2001,? New York.
For full program details please visit www.garp.com or contact GARP on tel. 
+44  (0)20? 7626 9300.

Of course, you could highlight your participation  at this event, which will 
include a two-day Convention with pre and post  Convention workshops and an 
Asset Management Forum that will include over 80  senior financial and risk 
management professionals. I have also attached a small  logo that could be 
used as a link to the GARP web site. Can I please have the  web address 
should you, or your colleagues manage to establish a web link to the  
Convention. If you also feel that there are any important web sites that 
this  Convention should be posted on, then I would appreciate it if you could 
pass on  this information.
?
Just to keep you informed, already, within a week  of the web site going 
'live', there have been about a dozen bookings and  numerous inquiries. This 
is a very good sign that GARP 2001 will be a great  success and will out-do 
GARP 2000.
?
Of course, if you have any questions or queries,  please do not hesitate to 
contact me. I thank you in advance for your  co-operation and I look forward 
to meeting you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Dear Colleagues:

We are writing to remind you of an opportunity for in-depth education on
electric power restructuring in Texas through a training workshop offered
by the University of Houston.

With the passage of Senate Bill 7, Texas is moving forward with electric
power restructuring.  What will the new marketplace look like?  How will it
function?  How will existing business opportunities be affected, and what
new ones are likely to emerge?  Join us for a comprehensive two-day
training workshop March 1-2, 2000 that addresses these issues and
accommodates both new and experienced professionals.  Hosted by the Energy
Institute at the University of Houston's College of Business
Administration, the training workshop features an introductory day that
will refresh participants on the basics of the electric power market and
key aspects of the restructuring process in Texas and the U.S.  The second
day targets advanced issues in the emerging marketplace and case studies
for practicioners.  The training workshop will be held at the Center for
Executive Development at the UH-CBA.  Instructors are Ms. Dottie Anderson
and Mr. Jim Stanton, each with extensive experience in the power industry
and ERCOT implementation, and Dr. Michelle Michot Foss, director of the
Energy Institute (see biographies, following workshop details).  To
register, return the form below with your information.  Payment, or an
indication of payment, must be received by Monday, February 28.  For more

*Changing Electricity Providers: Town Hall Issues
Bringing together the elements of regulatory activity, market power and
restructuring to the retail level, this exercise allows the participants to
make active decisions as our experimental "town" weighs the option of
separating from its traditional electricity provider and treading the
waters of competition. Our group will assume roles centered around
"regulators," "power marketers," the present "investor owned utility" and
the "town" itself. A town meeting will be convened in which each entity is
allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal
decision-makers that theirs is the best option. Embedded in the exercise is
the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules
leading up to this participatory segment. Frequent references to the basic
materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the
process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will
implement.
*Congestion Management
Congestion management is one of the most critical components of ERCOT
implementation.  A number of approaches exist for pricing electricity
during periods of high demand.  Each methodology bears important
consequences for both providors and customers.  Workshop participants will
participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment
with different methods of managing congestion.

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

could also communicate this announcement among other interested colleagues.

In fact, it would be most helpful to us and would be greatly appreciated, if
you could send me (also cc. to amicaliz@sda.uni-bocconi.it) a list of 5-10
colleagues to whom we can send the electronic version of the brochure.

Best wishes,

Ron,

We are really swamped and I would like to keep our involvement in
conferences to a reasonable minimum. I can promise that we shall help you
with a future conference if it happens to be in Houston.

Subject:  Invitation to Speak at Infocast's upcoming "Market Price
Volatility"
      program



Hi Vince,

I would like to invite you, or one of your staff, to be a speaker at
Infocast's upcoming conference "Market Price Volatility: How to Model,
Assess, and Manage Price Volatility in Today's Power Markets," scheduled for
May 10-12, 2000, in Chicago.  I am attaching a copy of the draft program
agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston
meeting a step farther by making this next session a more
technically-oriented meeting.

There are two spots you may wish to consider:

1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for
Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had
in mind for the case study.
2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for
Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you
a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call
me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.

I hope you can join us.

CASE STUDY GUIDELINES
1.   Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,
Southern California.

1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a
new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in
Pennsylvania.
2.   Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily
NYMEX
close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999.
3.   Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility
and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why
these models were considered. Candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally.
4.   Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation
criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,
Akaike information criterion.
5.   Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described.
6.   Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.
7.   If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.

Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case
study may include other things.

Vince,

I agree with Alex on this issue.

As an alternative for sponsorship.  The UT electrical engineering dept. is 
interested in sponsorship for research activities such as the one I just 
completed or as Martin performed when he was at UT (just thought that I would 
mention this as a possible alternative).  Would you be interested in a 
presentation or a "brown bag lunch" on this subject?

Subject: Re: PSERC Industrial Advisory Board Meeting Invitation  

Vince,
I think it is important to keep a good relationship with PSERC, but as of now,
it is not worth two days of your time to attend the board meeting.  Besides, 
since
we are not a sponsor yet, we have virtually no voice in the meeting and our 
presence
sometimes is awkward. Again, even if we are one of the thirty or so sponsors, 
our
voice is rather limited, for most of the other sponsors have different 
concerns from
ours.  One way to remedy this is to individually sponsor some research 
projects, via
sumer intern or invited talks.

Alex

Jim,

I can send you copies of the  reprints of some papers I wrote
or co-authored. Please, let me know how many copies do you need.

I shall prepare power point presentations for the student meeting
and for the faculty meeting.

For the students: review of my group (things we work on) with an intention
of generating some interest among the students and soliciting resumes.

For the faculty meeting: challenges that energy markets pose to financial 
modeling.
I shall be able to E-mail the Power Point presentations later this month.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Would you mind emailing to me a short biography/vita sometime when you get
a chance?  Also, if you have a paper to circulate or any PowerPoint slides
that you'll want to use either in your presentations to my students
Thursday afternoon, 2/3, or to the faculty seminar on Friday morning, 2/4,
please email these to me.  This would be greatly appreciated.

My colleagues and I are looking forward to your visit on Feb. 3-4 to LSU.

Sincerely,

Subject:  Invitation to the 20th Annual Rutgers Conference


Vince:

For two decades now, I have been a member of the faculty helping to
organize the Eastern Conferences on Regulation and Competition that Michael
Crew of Rutgers has chaired.  This year will be, in fact, the 20th
anniversary conference and a number of notable personages will be joining
us to celebrate what we have learned and what we haven't about the
economics of network industries.  Fred Kahn, Al Philipps, Bill Hogan and a
number of other distinguished academics will be reviewing our progress and
the prospects for the future.  The conference will take place at a
beautiful site in the Poconos, about 90 minutes north of Philadelphia, from
Wednesday afternoon May 24th to Friday afternoon May 26th.  You can check
for yourself the nature of the program and the conference site/hotel at the
following website URL:

http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~crri/WS.htm

Michael Crew and I would both be delighted if you would be willing to be an
after dinner speaker on Thursday evening (May 25th), just before the key
research reviews of Friday morning take place on the electricity, telephone
and gas industries, and following a day of special topics on emerging power
markets and other developments in network industries.   Naturally we would
be pleased if you would be able to stay for the entire conference, but
knowing your schedule, you may only have time for a part of it.  That would
not be a problem.  The usual after-dinner address is for 30 minutes,
followed by a short Q&A period.

Your presentation would help to underline the tremendous importance of
Enron in driving the development of new risk instruments to assist in price
discovery and efficient risk management for market participants, in energy
markets and more generally.  Both Michael and I feel that your perspectives
on the "new science of risk management" and what can be expected from it
could be a very important addition to this special anniversay event.

Please let me know (and please do copy Michael on your response) whether
your schedule will allow your participation in this very special event.
Michael and I would, of course, be very happy to follow up with you in
discussing the nature of the presentation, participants and so forth, if
this is a go.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Paul

Hi,

Details of our session info. at the INFORMS conference can be found at the
following link.  It'll be in the afternoon of 11/6 (Monday).

http://www.informs.org/Conf/SanAntonio2000//TALKS/MD29.html

Since we have 5 speakers, I expect each of us will have no more than 20
minutes to present.  Please keep that in mind and e-mail me if you have
any questions.  Please also inform me if there will be any changes.  Look
forward to seeing you all in San Antonio.

Bullet points:

1. The challenge of modeling price dynamics in the energy markets.
- seasonality
- fat tails
- jumps
- mean (or floor) reversion

2. Price volatility in the energy markets: definition and estimation
3. Adapting value-at-risk for the energy markets:
- combination of physical and financial contracts
- correct representation of price dynamics and inter-market price
relationships
- capturing complexity of energy contracts
4. Historical vs. Monte Carlo simulation vs. scenario analysis. Pros and cons
of different approaches.
5. Regulatory uncertainty and value-at-risk


Feel free to edit the bullet points if you see a typo (no spell checker on my
laptop for AOL).

Dear Dr Kaminsky,

on behalf of the Scientific Committee of the 2nd World Congress of the
Bachelier Finance Society, it is my pleasure to invite you to give one of
the plenary lectures.

The Bachelier Finance Society came into being in 1996 by the initiative of
mathematical finance researchers who found the need to create an
organization where academia and practitioners would meet and exchange
ideas spanning on the crossroads between Finance, Economics, Econometrics,
Insurance and Mathematics.

The conference is the Society's second biannual meeting and it will take
place in the island of Crete, from June 12 to June 15, 2002.
The other members of the Scientific Committee are G.Constantinides,
M.Davis, F.Delbaen, D.Duffie, H.Foellmer, M.Jeanblanc and E.Platen.
Either myself or any other member of the committee would be happy to
discuss with you about the Conference and the Society.

Crete is one of the most beautiful greek islands. The conference will take
place in a resort in Xersonissos, a picturesque site close to Irakleion
and Knossos. The airfare (economy class) and all local expenses (lodging,
meals and local transportation) will be covered.

We will all be honored by your presence.

Sincerely,

Thaleia Zariphopoulou

Chair of the Scientific Committee
V.N.Neuhaus Professor
Dpts of Mathematics and MSIS
The University of Texas at Austin

Vince and Chistie,
Sorry you won't be attending our April 20 ET event, but of course we realize that many of our partners can't attend every event. 
With this in mind, we put conference reports online in a "quick read" format for busy executives.  Our site is located at:  http://emertech.wharton.upenn.edu - we'll be adding new reports in the coming 2 weeks.
I would also ask, is there anyone else at Enron involved in mergers and acquisitions who would benefit from the April 20 event?  This will be one of our most "content-rich" events - reporting on surveys on high tech acquisitions as well as best practices in successful mergers and partnerships. Please feel free to pass on the invitation to colleagues at Enron who you feel might find this worthwhile, or you can give me email addresses if you'd like me to extend the invitation with the most recent agenda.
We very much appreciate Enron's support of the ET Program and look forward to your participation in the future.
Best regards,
Michael

hi Michael!
Sorry I will be unable to attend!  I believe both Vince and I are
previously committed.
Thanks!

Hi Vince

It is my great pleasure to invite you to speak at POWER 2000 which will be
in Houston on 9 & 10 May 2000.

Would you be interested in chairing one of the streams on day 2 of the
conference? Or making a full presentation on one of the days? Please let me
know which talks interest you. Obviously, some of the talks are no longer
available but I would like to give you a choice as much as possible. Please
could you get back to me asap on 212 925 1864 Ext 151 or by return email.

I very much hope you can make the dates as I'm very keen to have you
participate at POWER. Not to flatter you unnecessarily, but I know that a
lot of people come to our conferences to hear what you have to say.

Best regards

Emma

FYI,

I thought some of you might be interested in this half day seminar at UT.  
Bill Hogan, as well as speakers from the ISO and PUC are scheduled to speak.  
I plan to attend.  If we have more than 3, we can register as a group for 
$145/person - if more than 10 attend, the price is $100/person.  Ross 
Baldick, one of Martin Lin's and my advisor is the moderator.  It may prove 
both interesting and contentious will Hogan being there.

Good morning Amy:

Vince Kaminski will need the following:

An LCD Projector to hook up to a lap tap for his presentation
He will have dinner with the conference organizers and speakers on the 29th.
He will need 2 nights (the 28th and the 29th) hotel reservations.

He will send you an abstract shortly.

Thanks and have a great day!

Ms. Crenshaw,

Thank you for sending the bio so quickly.  It's exactly what I was looking
for.

We are planning to compile the conference speakers' papers for distribution
to the participants.  While I will not need Dr. Kaminski's contribution for
several weeks, an abstract of his presentation as soon as possible would be
very useful to the conference organizers.

I will also need the following information:

- Dr. Kaminski's audio/video equipment requirements for his presentation
- will he be joining the conference organizers and speakers for dinner on
May 29?
- which nights will he be staying in Toronto?  I will reserve a room at the
conference hotel
- any dietary restrictions or special requests

Your help is much appreciated.

Best wishes,

Amy

Sorry to hear you cannot make it ... you would obviously have been the big

In terms of a London based replacement, who did you have in mind and what

Subject:  KWI User Group


Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Vince,
I am writing in regards to an energy derivatives training course I am
developing.  I would like to invite you to be an instructor for the course.
A preliminary agenda is attached.  Brett Humphreys from Risk Capital
Management is teaching on Day One, and I was wondering if you would be
interested in covering all or part of Day Two.  The topics outlined here can
be modified based on your feedback.

Our training courses are structured for an interactive, classroom-type
setting.  We limit the audience to 25 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to
cover the material over the course of two days.

I will follow up but please let me know what you think.

PoweRisk 2001

The Global Premier ForumforEnergy Trading & Risk  Management

?6th - 9th November  2001, Paris

?
Dear Mr Kaminski, 
?
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in 
Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning 
the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - 
brilliant!
?
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. 
The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I 
would me more than happy if you could join us again.  
?
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical") 
topics that are already covered:
?


Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of Exotic 
Energy  Contracts

multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts 
adding jumps 
applying the models to  exotic energy options 
extensions to multiple  energy contracts

speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that 
something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility 
And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would 
be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has 
not been covered  yet.
?

Ron,

I am sorry to inform you that due to a scheduling conflict I cannot speak at 
this conference.
I want to thank you for considering me as a speaker.

Vince Kaminski

Subject: Invitation to Speak at Infocast's upcoming "Market Price Volatility" 
program



Hi Vince,

I would like to invite you, or one of your staff, to be a speaker at
Infocast's upcoming conference "Market Price Volatility: How to Model,
Assess, and Manage Price Volatility in Today's Power Markets," scheduled for
May 10-12, 2000, in Chicago.  I am attaching a copy of the draft program
agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston
meeting a step farther by making this next session a more
technically-oriented meeting.

There are two spots you may wish to consider:

1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for
Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had
in mind for the case study.
2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for
Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.

I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you
a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call
me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.

I hope you can join us.

CASE STUDY GUIDELINES
1. Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,
Southern California.

1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a
new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio
of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in
Pennsylvania.
2. Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily NYMEX
close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999.
3. Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility
and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why
these models were considered. Candidate models should be described
mathematically and verbally.
4. Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation
criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,
Akaike information criterion.
5. Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The
estimation procedure employed should be briefly described.
6. Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.
7. If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.

Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case
study may include other things.

Shijie,

Additional   changes.

Abstract:

The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may reflect the flaws in power pools design and incomplete transition to 
fully deregulated markets in
generation and transmission.


The title is fine.

Vince

Vince,

Thanks for the abstract!  For the purpose of the conference program
listing, the conference organizers need a title and an abstract which is
longer than 50 words.  Based on the abstract that you sent me, I took the
liberty to make up a title and the 50-word abstract (attached below).
Please make changes as you feel necessary and send them back to me.  I'll
send them out to the organizers once I get your confirmation on this.

Best,

Title: Current Challenges in Modeling Power Price Volatility

Author: Dr. Vince Kaminski, Head of Quantitative Research, Enron Capital &
Trade Resources

Abstract:
The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
expanded customer choice.

I'd like to give a talk entitled "Diagrammatic Representation of Real Optio=

in Enron", in which I will give a brief run-down of a diagrammatic techniqu=
e=20
I have developed for representing real option deals.  My notation allows=20
originators, managers and quants to communicate unambiguously, while still=
=20
appreciating the complexity and subtlety of real optionality.  I have defin=
ed=20
a "diagrammatic grammar" which guarantees that the pricing of the deal=20
follows immediately and automatically from the diagram.

I propose to introduce the symbols and grammar, then go on to present some=

suitable examples of diagrams.  If appropriate I'll talk about the links wi=

dynamic programming.  (I will need some guidance as to how much technical=

detail I can go into based on the audience.)

All the best,
Steve

Dear Vince,

I apologise for sending another email.  I was wondering if you could confirm 
your talk title (plus some bullet points) for your presentation at our Annual 
US Congress.  I have attached a condensed programme for the event - you are 
speaking on stream three, part of the new research in derivatives modelling 
and analysis section.
Unfortunately we are printing the brochure at the end of the week and will 
need these details by thursday 27 January.

Best regards,
Oliver

Dear Vince,

I spoke with you briefly yesterday regarding Grant Masson.  You informed me
that he is no longer an Enron employee.  I have also been informed that
Grant has not yet been replaced.

I am inquiring because Infocast would like to have an Enron representative
speak at an upcoming conference entitled "Power Crisis in the West: Status &
Outlook for Wholesale and Retail Markets".  Is there someone else at Enron
whom you would recommend to speak at the conference?

I have attached the program agenda for your review.  Knowing a bit about
Grant's expertise, I specifically wanted him to participate on the panel
"How Will Power Prices Play Out in 2001-2005?".  Please let me know if there
is someone else at Enron whom I should speak with regarding this topic, or
others that may be of interest to Enron.

I look forward to working with Enron on this conference; it is certainly
going to be an exciting conference due to all of the controversy surrounding
the situation in San Diego.

Kind Regards,
Nia Mansell

PoweRisk 2001

The Global Premier ForumforEnergy Trading & Risk  Management

 6th - 9th November  2001, Paris

 
Dear Mr Kaminski, 
 
I am responsible for the programme of this year's  PoweRisk conference in Paris. Helyette Geman has informed me that she has  contacted you concerning the workshop and that you are happy to do it with her  again this year - brilliant!
 
I would like to know if you are also interested in  delivering a paper again. The audience in previous years greatly appreciated  your contribution, and I would me more than happy if you could join us again.  
 
To give you an idea of the programme so far, these are  the ("technical") topics that are already covered:
 


Chris  Strickland: Forward Curve Models with Jumps for the Pricing of Exotic Energy  Contracts

multi-factor forward  curve models for the valuation of energy contracts 
adding jumps 
applying the models to  exotic energy options 
extensions to multiple  energy contracts 

Les  Clewlow: Valuation and Risk Management of Virtual Power Stations and Gas  Supply Agreements

Structures of  Gas Supply Agreements (GSA) 
Relationships  between Physical and Virtual Power Stations (PPS/VPS) 
Valuation  methods for GSA's and VPS's 
Risk Analysis of GSA's  and VPS's

Chris Harris,  Director of Market Development.Operations and Engineering, INNOGY: Applying  Cutting-Edge Portfolio Management Theory In Order To Optimise Your Risk Exposure  

Establishing  and valuing the key factors using a bottom up approach

The treatment of the risk  of infrequent but high impact events

Major changes  in the industry and their impact on Credit Risk 
Effects of  new risk profiles on credit appetite: Credit analysis; Limit Setting; Risk  Reducing Structures 
Importance of Credit in  the Organizational Structure: Reporting; Dependence; Structure of Credit  Department

Brett  Humphreys: Examining Cutting-Edge Credit Exposure Mitigation Tools: Combining  Counterparty and Portfolio Credit VaR Techniques

Helyette Geman: Pricing of exotic energy derivatives and structured  contracts

Please let me know if you are interested  in joining the PoweRisk 2001 speaker panel, and which topic you would like to  cover. I think that something along the lines of last year's talk (State-of-the-Art Volatility And Correlation Estimation  Techniques For Multiple Energy Portfolios)  would be brilliant again, but please  feel free to chose something else that has not been covered  yet.
 
I look forward to hearing  from you,

Dear Shirley
?
Further to our telephone conversation earlier  today, I am writing concerning 
the GARP 2001 Convention, which will be held in  New York between 13th and 
14th February.
?
I have set a new deadline for presentations to be  sent to me, which is 
Friday 5th January. I am sure you can appreciate that  collating, arranging, 
organising and printing over 80 presentations is a mammoth  logistical task, 
hence why I require the presentations as soon as  possible.
?
Can I please have an indication of when I am likely  to receive Vince's 
presentation? Below is the talk he has agreed to give (he has  also agreed to 
chair the stream on Energy & Corporate Risk on Tuesday 13th  February):
?
Measuring Energy Risk -  Tackling Price Volatility, Adapting VaR, Scenario 
Modeling and Regulatory  Requirements
- mean (or floor)  reversion

I'd like to make a personal invitation to you to attend RDI's annual user
conference at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, just north of San Diego.  We are
planning two sessions for GPCM users (and prospective users) which I think
you will find very interesting and useful.  Plus we are also going to
schedule individual sessions for those that would like them, as was quite
successful last year.  The details are included in the attached Word file
below.  I've also included the program in pdf format.  The last page is a
signup form you can fill out and fax in to RDI if you haven't already done
so.
Please let me and Mike know how many are coming from your team.  You can
reply to this e-mail to let us know.
Looking forward to seeing you there.
I think it's going to be fun.
Bob Brooks
Mike Farina

Vince - Thanks for the update.  I've been pulled into a 7:00 am breakfast
which I must attend.  Chances are I could catch up with everyone between
8:00 and 8:15.  I apologize, but  two of my breakfast dates are taking
special flights in just for the breakfast - or I wouldn't inconvenience
everyone.

Dear Vince,

I would like to confirm the invitation for you to participate at our annual  
congress in Houston. Following our conversation, I would be most interested 
in  including a presentation on 'Modeling price volatility in US power  
markets'  in the pricing, hedging & trading stream on the 14th May,  2001.

I am keen to confirm each speaker and session by the end of next week, which  
will then allow time to work with each presenter on titles and points that 
will  provide an accurate summary for the session.

If you have any overall views or suggestions regarding the conference feel  
free to email me at pbristow@riskwaters.com or call me on  212 925 6990, 
extn. 225. I look forward to confirming your participation at  Energy & Power 
Risk Management 2001. IMPORTANT: Due to system problems I am  using another 
system. Please do not reply to this email. Please reply to the  address given 
above.

Yours sincerely,

Paul Bristow

That should be fine, as long as you keep to a general overview and 
dissertation work.  You can talk about different modeling approaches in the 
industry, and indicate, if asked, that Enron looks at all approaches but not 
be specific about which particular one we believe in.  

Can you give me more details on the meeting?  I may like to attend as well.

Thanks,
Vasant

Vince and Vasant,

I was asked by one of my advisors to be on a panel for the summer Power 
Engineering Society.  I stated that I couldn't divulge any information on 
modeling efforts at Enron but could give a general overview and cover my 
dissertation work.  He stated that he understood and other companies had 
expressed similar concerns.

I guess that I need your OK to attend this presentation and present.

Thanks,
Lance

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Am I entitled to bringing one delegate as a guest, free of charge?
Some conferences offer such privileges.

Subject: GARP 2001 Convention



Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
?
This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the 
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th 
February, 2001.
?
Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP 2000. 
There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention. Delegate 
bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a result, we are 
set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention  earlier this year. 
The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management Forum  are also very 
well received and will probably reach full capacity. I will of  course 
provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of the  event.
?
Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:
?
1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th 
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a 
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and New 
York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure you can 
appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to be taken 
into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required as soon as 
possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you bring your 
presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy disc or a 
laptop.
?
2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what audio-visual 
requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection - notably 
PowerPoint). 
?
3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you 
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my 
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.
?
If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact me, 
otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.
?
I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.
?
Kind regards
?
Andreas

Could you please send me the title and a 50-word abstract of your

Vince,

 I understand you'll be speaking at the CEFER conference. Gary Taylor, the 
head of marketing in the Weather Deriv. group, would like to know if you plan 
on mentioning weather derivatives at all and that if you do, he has numerous 
existing slides and presentations that might be useful to you.

Dear Vince,

As the above event is drawing closer, I thought I would write a quick email 
to finalise a few things with you.  I understand that you would like a guest 
to attend, please can you let me know their name and job title.  Also, if you 
could send me your conference checklist I would appreciate it, so that I can 
finalise details with my audio visual company.

In the meantime, if there is anything I can do for you, please do not 
hesitate to let me know on 0171-915-5116.

Kind Regards
Crystal

Conference in Houston


Dear Ms. Kaminsky:
As I just mentioned on your voicemail, Infocast is going to host a  Managing
Summer Price Volatility course, January 30 - February 1, 2001 in Houston.
The course will focus on the various tools at hand to manage summer price
and load volatility.  Our target audience for this event will primarily be
risk managers and managers in bulk power sales & purchase (our secondary
target audience is energy traders).

Attached you will find a draft program agenda for your review.  Please let
me know if you or someone else at Enron is interested in presenting at this
event.  In particular, we are looking for someone to talk about weather
derivatives.

I appreciate you taking the time to review the conference schedule and I
hope that I will have an opportunity to talk to you. Unfortunately, I am
running behind schedule in finalizing this program.  I will call tomorrow to
see what your feedback is.  If you have any questions or suggestions, please
do not hesitate to contact me at (818) 888-4445 ext. 30.

Sincerely,

Britta Bothe

Greetings from the Global Association of Risk Professionals!!  We are
putting together a panel for our March meeting related to one of the
following topics; Cost of Capital, estimating risk premium, and CAPM
approaches to measuring Risk.  Currently, we have Steve Mann, an assistant
professor of Finance at TCU, is scheduled to speak and we are seeking
additional volunteers for our panel. If you are interested please respond
via email. If your organization would like to host the event, please let me
know so that arrangements can be made.

FYI, we have identified resources in New York City that would come to
Houston to speak, and we are in need of a sponsor (or suggestions) to cover
the general expense of bringing these individuals to Houston.

Steve Mann is an assistant professor of Finance at the Neeley School at TCU,
where he teaches courses in derivatives and corporate finance. His primary
area of research is trading, with focus on the risk & reward of market
making in derivative contracts, as well as behavioral aspects of trading,
and liquidity measurement. His publications to date include papers in the
Review of Financial Studies, the Journal of Business, and the Journal of
Futures Markets.

Looking forward to your response.
Respectfully,
Frank Hayden

Please find attached the programs for two back-two-back conferences on real
options at Cambridge University in UK. The two conferences are separate but
complementary events. The first conference, co-sponsored with Andersen
Consulting and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, on July 5-6, is a professional
conference on Real Options Valuation in the Information Economy:
Internet/High-tech/Telecom, R&D/Pharma, Energy. For info. and online
registration see www.rogroup.com.

The second is the 4th Annual International Conference on Real Options:
Theory Meets Practice (the annual industry event where academics and
practitioners get together to share the latest developments on theory and
applications), co-organized with U. Cambridge on July 7-8. For info. and
online registration see www.realoptions.org

Among the two events, we are pleased to present an extensive array of
practitioner and academic presentations, sharing of experiences by corporate
executives, and panel discussions by experts from leading organizations and
universities. Our keynote speaker this year will be Myron S. Scholes,
co-developer of the Black-Scholes option valuation.

Interested participants  must register for the conference (preferably on
line) and indicate hotel preferences (among 5-6 hotels)  by June 15
(latest).

We look forward to seeing you at this exciting event, and would appreciate
if you share this with interested colleagues.

Sorry to hear you cannot make it ... you would obviously have been the big
catch !!

In terms of a London based replacement, who did you have in mind and what
sort of subject could they cover ?

Dear Vince

Please may I reintroduce myself. We met last year at the Sydney EPRM
conference which my company KWI sponsored. I chaired the session at which
you spoke.

As you may remember, my company, KWI are one of the world's leading
provider
of systems (kW3000) and consultancy for energy, trading and risk
management.
We have over 60 clients worldwide including many of the world's leading
energy companies (not Enron unfortunately):

North America
- TVA
- Ontario Power
- Cinergy
- Bonneville Power

Europe
- Enel
- ATEL
- Electrabel
- EDF

Nordic
- Vattenfall
- Fortum
- Sydkraft
- Statkraft
- Birka Energi
- Norsk Hydro

Each year we stage a "KWI Users Forum" - a 2-day event attended by leading
trading and risk staff from our clients. Last year there were about 100
delegates. The agenda primarily focusses on issues surrounding risk
management for the energy sector.

The agenda comprises keynote presentations on burning risk issues from
industry leading energy speakers and practical workshops focussed around
using our software.

This years event is at a luxury hotel in the wonderful Spanish city of
Barcelona and runs from the evening of Sunday September 9th to Tuesday
September 11th. The main conference dinner is on the Monday evening and is
always a memorable event. This year it is in a leading Barcelona restaurant
preceded by a bus tour of the city with a stop for pre-dinner drinks.

I would like to invite you to make the opening keynote address, the
highlight of the conference.

The subject could be:

*    a general energy risk related topic
*    a general insight into the secret of Enron's continued success in
the energy markets
*    your thoughts on the future development on energy markets (and other
commodity related - bandwidth etc.) worldwide

Obviously, we would cover all your delagate costs including accomodation,
food and drink.

What's in it for you ? Many of our users are some the energy sectors
leading
risk thinkers and I'm sure you would enjoy meeting them and exchanging
views.

Please let me know if you are able to accept the invitation.

Best regards


David Warwick - Marketing Dierctor and Co-founder

Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

David,

I am leaving for vacation this weekend and I haven't received the copy of 
your presentation yet.
The window during which I could make changes to my presentation is closing 
very fast. Let's
do the following: I shall keep my presentation as is (this means that I shall 
use the copy of my 
presentation I sent to Dawn Scovill  and you this week). If there is an 
overlap between our presentations, so be it.

Dawn, please use the copy of my presentation I sent you earlier this week.

Vince

Dawn,

I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
our presentations.
This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
The portions of my presentation
will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
plus examples of some
standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
specific deals executed by our companies.

I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
the deadline is.

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.

Hi Lane

I *will* be free to speak at your conference on 12th July, so put my name 
down.  I will give a talk on my "Diagrammatic Approach to Real Options".  
Will you have a laptop projector available?  Do you require any advance 
submission of material?

Cheers,

Dear Steven,

Further to our conversation I am delighted that you will be speaking at the
forthcoming Real Options conference which will take place on Monday 27th &
Tuesday 28th November in Central London.

I have attached the pdf of the conference Vince spoke at in February and the
draft programme of the November conference.

As discussed could you please email me with a suggested talk title and
between 5 and 8 bullet points to be included in the conference programme.
It would be great if you could emphasise the practicality of your talk and
that you will be using your own experience of working with real options at
Enron as part of the talk.

If you do have the delegate list from the IQPC conference it would be useful
to see who attended so that we can improve on our marketing for the
conference in november.  You can either email me or fax it to me on 020 7393
0313.

I look forward to receiving your talk in the next day or so.

Kind regards

Julia

 <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.

Subject:	UT Short Course travel arrangements

If the schedule works, perhaps a carpool is best for attending the course, given the number of us going.  Vasant has offered to drive.  Dependiing on driving speed and traffic, leaving Houston by 9:30am should give sufficient time to make the 1pm class, including some time for lunch.

Please let me know if you are interested in the carpool or have alternate plans or suggestions.

Thanks,
Martin

The Energy Symposium is one of the largest energy conferences in the world and
we are successful in attracting senior energy executives as speakers to this
2-day event.  This year's event will be November 28 & 29.

The Energy Symposium is much more that just an "accounting conference."
Industry leaders discuss a range of topics and share their perspectives on
strategic, economic, political, financial and operating issues.

Participants find the networking aspect of the Symposium to be especially
valuable.  There is ample time during the event for them to meet and talk with
their counterparts and colleagues in the industry.  And it is a premier
marketing opportunity for Arthur Andersen, where more than 300 partners and
managers get to spend two days with 700 executives from the energy and 
utilities
industry in a forum.

The Symposium check-in begins Monday, November 27 at 6 p.m., with a cocktail
reception in the Galleria Ballroom Foyer.  Arthur Andersen personnel are
encouraged to attend for an opportunity to network with colleagues, clients 
and
prospective clients in an informal setting.

Thank you in advance and I look forward to seeing you and your clients in
Houston.

Victor A. Burk

Thanks for the comments Grant.  The presentation is for a couple of external 
conferences that Vince volunteered me for - Vince has OK'd the content, and 
Stinson raised exactly the same issues as you.  Unfortunately I just don't 
seem to be getting any response from RISK whatsoever on the publication of my 
article, so these conferences will be the public debut for my real options 
notation.

Of course the discounting/risk neutrality thing is where the real judgement 
sits.  When questions arise I'll take the line that while Research formulates 
the models using appropriate derivatives/market based valuation methods, we 
work with our RAC group which considers the discounting to be associated with 
various risks, and chooses these rates appropriately.  The notation makes 
clear which uncertainties we are exposed to at different stages of the deals, 
which assists in choosing the rates.

In practice I'm not yet at the stage where originators are using my notation 
yet - another reason I can't say too much about its actual use at the 
conference.  I'm producing various tools for deterministic hydro 
optimization, GBM swing option valuation, and deterministic DP optimization 
for genset dispatch which people want right now - I'm working in the 
background on the kind of modelling my notation demands.  People are getting 
to know me as a guy who can solve their immediate problems, and they'll be 
more likely to listen when  I start rolling out the "proper" options-based 
models.  My notation is currently used only in the specs I'm writing for the 
tools I'm producing.

I'll be turning Dale's spreadsheet-based power plant spread model into an 
American Monte Carlo tool, which will then be available for inclusion in 
other models.  I think by the end of the summer the real options theoretical 
work will start to bear fruit, one year after I initially proposed the 
notation.  With the quant IT group I'm co-creating in place, I may yet see 
the automated diagramming/pricing tool made real.

Thanks also for the pointer to Tom Halliburton.  The use of the LINGO 
LP/integer package is something I've been presented with for the Teesside 
plant operation optimizer, rather than something I chose.  The PERM (Physical 
Energy Risk Mgt) group just got a couple of analysts to hack it together 
(including Natasha Danilochkina), then asked me to tidy it up when it didn't 
work.  They are going to use their existing faulty model for now (to meet 
their project deadlines), and I'm sketching out a proper mathematical spec 
for the problem.

I've persuaded (!) them that this sort of business-critical system should be 
developed properly by Research, and they now seem happy to fall into line.  
Their Wilton plant optimizer was developed by one Peter Morawitz, the guy I 
hoped to recruit into Research, and they obviously didn't realise he was 
better than average at quantitative modelling.  Anyway they now accept that 
doing it properly will take months rather than weeks, and I'll have a freer 
hand in my choice of modelling tool - so a chat with Tom would be extremely 
valuable.

Cheers,
Steve

Steve:

I read through your presentation.  Looks good as expected.  Remind me; is 
this an internal Enron or external presentation? If external, I would say it 
is just at the limit before sliding into proprietary stuff.  Perhaps that's 
why you've neatly almost entirely avoided questions about discounting and 
risk-neutrality or lack of it?

Regards,
Grant.

Hi Vince

I see you're speaking at the Austin conference.  Will you be in the Houston 
office during the earlier part of the week?  If so, I may look into arranging 
a trip out to meet you guys, and take in the conference too.

Sorry I didn't dial in to the updat emeeting on Tuesday - I was delivering

Happy New Year! Hope you all had a wonderful holiday season.

On behalf of the University of Texas Finance Department and CEFER, we
would
like to cordially invite you to attend our:

2001 Energy Finance Conference
Austin, Texas
February 22 - 23, 2001
Hosted by the University of Texas Finance Department

_______________________________________________________________________
Information about the talks and the speakers

Dr. Curt Hunter
Research Director, Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago

Dr. Hunter's discussion is entitled "Lessons Learned from Recent Global
Financial Crises."  Since 1990, major banking and currency crises have
occurred in many countries around the world - including Mexico and Latin
America in 1994, East Asia in 1997-98, and Russia and Brazil in 1998,
among others - with large costs both to the individual countries
experiencing the crises and to other nations.  As a result, considerable
effort has been expended by economists and policymakers to identify the
causes of these crises and to design programs with the aim of preventing,
if possible, similar crises from occurring in the future, and minimizing
the costs when they do occur.  This talk reviews the key lessons
policymakers have learned from these recent episodes and highlights the
role that risk management plays in crisis prevention.

Dr. William C. (Curt) Hunter is senior vice president and director of
research at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago.  He is a member of the
Bank's Management Committee and serves as the Bank's chief economist.
He is responsible for a staff of 115 professionals and oversees the
Bank's research activities in the areas of monetary policy, banking
and financial markets, and regional economics programs.  He is also
responsible for the Bank's Statistical and Financial Reports function.
Dr. Hunter is an associate economist on the Federal Open Market Committee,
the Federal Reserve System's primary monetary policy group.
Previously, he was a vice president at the Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta and has served on the faculties of the University of Georgia,
Emory University, Chicago State University, and Northwestern University.
He has consulted with numerous foreign central banks, official agencies,
and private corporations and serves on the boards of several research
and nonprofit organizations.  He is co-editor of Research in Banking
and Finance and serves on the editorial boards of several academic
journals.   Dr. Hunter earned a B.S. degree in 1970 from Hampton
Institute (now Hampton University), an MBA in Finance in 1972 and a Ph.D.
in Finance and Environment in 1978 from Northwestern University.

Dr. Mary Mathewes Kassis
Associate Director, Georgia State University Economic Forecasting Center

Dr. Kassis will provide her outlook for the Georgia and Atlanta economies
over the next two years.  She will focus on economic risks specific to
Atlanta, including its exposure to the contraction of the IT sector,
potential over development of office space, and a declining rate of job
growth.  Regardless of your field, this should be a very informative
discussion.

Dr. Kassis has been analyzing the Southeast economy for over five years.
She writes a quarterly report that examines the current economic
conditions in 13 Southeastern states as well as an outlook for the next
couple of years. She also prepares an in-depth quarterly analysis of the
outlook for the Georgia and Atlanta economies.  She is regularly quoted
in publications such as the Wall Street Journal, the Atlanta Journal-
Constitution, and the Atlanta Business Chronicle.  Dr. Kassis received
a B.A. in Economics and Political Science from Agnes Scott College and
a Ph.D. in Economics from Georgia State University.

Dr. Alan White
Professor of Finance, University of Toronto
Mr. Pete van Amson, CFA, CPA
Vice President, Product Management, SunGard Trading and Risk Systems

Dr. Alan White and Mr. Peter van Amson will discuss applied term
structure modeling.  SunGard has implemented a version of the Hull-White
term structure model that banks use in measuring and managing the market
value sensitivity of various balance sheet components.  Peter will touch
on some of the complexities involved in modeling non-maturity deposits;
with regard to the term structure of interest rates, Alan will discuss
some of the problems and possible solutions in bridging the divide between
what is required from a theoretical standpoint and what is feasible
in a production process.

Dr. Alan White is a Professor of Finance in the Joseph L. Rotman School
of Management at the University of Toronto. His research is principally
in the area of derivative securities, their pricing and their use by
financial institutions for risk management. He is most noted for his
work on modeling the term structure of interest rates in a way that
is consistent with observed market data. Recently his research has been
focused on the pricing and management of credit risk.  Professor White
has published many scholarly articles, but is perhaps best recognized
for providing lucid insights into the practical application and
implementation of this research. Much of his material is included in
the best-selling book Hull-White on Derivatives, co-authored with
John Hull.

Mr. Peter van Amson is the Vice President of Product Management at
SunGard Trading and Risk Systems where he is responsible for the
development of all functional specifications for the BancWare product
suite.  In this capacity, he frequently interacts with SunGard
user-committees, leading academics, and other leading industry
practitioners.  He frequently makes presentations at conferences and
seminars sponsored by BAI, AMIfs, the OCC, as well as other organizations.
Prior to working with BancWare, Peter headed the Strategic Planning
Function for the Plymouth Rock Company, one of America's most profitable
insurance holding companies.  In this role, he helped define the
company's strategic vision as well as being involved in investment
analysis, asset/ liability management and quantitative profitability
aanalysis.  Peter has a B.S. and M.S. in Accounting from the State
University of New York at Binghamton.  He is currently a Ph.D. candidate
at the University of Michigan.  Peter has received numerous academic awards
and honors including the William Andrew Paton Fellowship at the
University of Michigan and the New York State Society of Certified
Public Accountants Award for Academic Excellence.

Dr. Dennis Wong
Vice President, Quantitative Finance, Bank of America Securities

Dr. Wong will discuss competing vendor approaches to credit risk
modeling, including CreditMetrics, KMV, CreditRisk+ and CreditPortfolio
View.  These models are viewed in a theoretical framework that
identifies migration probabilities, credit exposure and loss
aggregation.

Dr. Wong has a Ph.D. in Mathematical Finance from Carnegie Mellon
University.  He has given talks and seminars for the American
Mathematical Society, the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics,
the University of Toronto, and Georgia Tech.  He is the author of
"Generalized Optimal Stopping and Financial Markets", published in
Pitman Research Notes in Mathematics Series.

Dear Vince,

Dzien dobry. Many thanks for agreeing to take the remainder of the VaR
seminar - it is a great help. I asked Raymond Yeow of Enron Australia if he
would chair day one but he said that you would be a bigger draw and perhaps
better placed. To this end, I am hoping that you would consider chairing day
one's plenary session and trading stream. You can blame Raymond for
recommending you!  I appreciate that this is asking even more of you than
you originally signed up for but you seem to be famous in this small market
and it would be great if you could do it.
I apologise for imposing once again but look forward to hearing back from
you when you get a chance. As ever, let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,

Joel

Vince and Stinson,

Alex and I attended the International Chinese Petroleum and Petrocehmical 
Technology conference
in Houston.  We presented two talks 1) Risk management in petroleum industry 
and 2) Real option
valuation of oil field.  The section chairman said our talks were the high 
moments in the business session. 

There were several interesting talks in the business section.  I am going to 
get a copy of the presentation on
Internet opportunity in energy trading, where the author did a study about 
all energy trading sites including
EnronOnLine.  A talk from a gentleman working for Costal (used to be pal of 
Song Yip) on real 
assets management is also very informative.  A talk about using real option 
theory for IT managenet was
also interesting.

Big players, ExxonMobil, Shell, Taxco, and BP have strong presence in the 
conference.

I made a copy for you of the keynote speech by Bob Gee, the Assistant Energy 
Secretary under Clinton
Administration about the energy outlook.  

Zimin

Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.   

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this year.

Vince Kaminski

discussion will be on ISO/RTO issues, and will involve executives from

Hi Amy:

That is fine, Vince was going to come on the 28th anyway, but he will probably
need to come earlier - please let me know what time you have scheduled
the dinner so I can make his airline reservations.  

Thanks!

Shirley

Hi Shirley,

I just realized that I goofed on the dinner - it will be held on Sunday,
May 28th instead of the 29th.  Sorry about that!

I hope your day is going well so far.

Amy

Join Mr. Merrill and Mr. Brown at an advanced seminar scheduled for July.

The basic training sessions will update participants as to the definition of
a derivative, cash flow hedging, fair value hedging, foreign exchange
hedging, and elements of implementation.  This course will cover the
prerequisites for successful participation in the advanced seminar. The
basic will also help facilitate participation in the GARP FAS 133 sessions.
The first basic training seminar will be held June 28, 2000 at the New York
Society of Security Analysts headquarters in the World Trade Center.
Registration and other detailed information are available from Philip
Merrill at garpny1@home.com, or on www.garp.com.

Paul, 

My apologies for a delay in getting back to you with my bullet points. The  
beginning of the year was quite hectic. I am working from home today, trying  
to catch up. 

The program for the 2001 Conference looks great; it's likely to be the most  
interesting and best attended EPRM Conference (hopefully, some players will  
be still around). 

To answer some of your questions: 

1. I shall be glad to serve on the panel 
2. The title of the talk is fine (American spelling of modelling is modeling) 
3. Bullet points will follow in the next message (I shall send it in a few  
minutes)

Dear Dr. Kaminski

here is an email invitation for teh SIAM event.  A hard copy will follow

Dr. V. Kaminski
Enron
P.O. Box 1188
Houston, Texas 77251-1188

Dear Dr. Kaminski

March 12, 2001





I am writing to formalize your invitation to attend, participate, and speak
in the SIAM Southwest Regional Mathematics in Industry Workshop.   A time
span of thirty minutes is being allotted to invited talks with an
additional
ten minutes or so for discussion.  The workshop, funded under the auspices
of a National Science Foundation grant to SIAM will not be a standard
applied mathematics event with representatives from industry, academe, and
governmental agencies presenting their latest research results.  Instead
the
meeting will emphasize the mathematics and technology currently applied to
the projects of industry and governmental laboratories.  Additionally the
event will focus upon the mechanisms facilitating interaction and
collaboration between the academy, industry, and government laboratories.

The workshop will be held at the University of Houston Hilton Hotel, April
27-28.  Funds will be available to support both travel expenses and the
cost
of food and lodging of invited speakers.  We will be happy to make travel
arrangements on this end if so desired.

We hope that you can accept our invitation.  If this is the case please
furnish us with a title,  a short abstract, and a list of the necessary
equipment for your presentation.

We look forward to seeing you at the University of Houston.



Sincerely


W. Fitzgibbon

Vince,

Thanks for the abstract!  For the purpose of the conference program
listing, the conference organizers need a title and an abstract which is
longer than 50 words.  Based on the abstract that you sent me, I took the
liberty to make up a title and the 50-word abstract (attached below).
Please make changes as you feel necessary and send them back to me.  I'll
send them out to the organizers once I get your confirmation on this.

Best,

Shijie

Title: Current Challenges in Modeling Power Price Volatility

Author: Dr. Vince Kaminski, Head of Quantitative Research, Enron Capital &
Trade Resources

Abstract:
The power market developments in the US have created several unique
challenges for energy industry economists. We discuss the major factors 
underlying
the exceptionally high volatility of electricity prices. We feel that some of
them may be a necessary price to pay for increased market efficiency and
expanded customer choice.

Mr. Kaminski,

Thank you for responding. I'm sorry you won't be able to attend, but very
much appreciate your willingness to reconsider your decision about
participating in PSERC. We will certainly keep you informed about on-going
and new PSERC activities that may be of interest to ENRON.

Best regards,

Dennis Ray

Dear Mr. Ray,

I regret to inform you that due to very heavy workload we cannot attend
the Power Systems Engineering Research Center's
upcoming Industrial Advisory Board meeting in Oak Brook.

Our  work load does not leave us much time to get involved
with PSERC at this moment. We would very much like to stay
in touch and plan to reconsider our decision in the second half of this
year.

Mr. Kaminski,

Greetings. Bob Thomas, Shmuel Oren and I invite you to attend the Power
Systems Engineering Research Center's upcoming Industrial Advisory Board
meeting in Oak Brook, IL. It will be held on May 31 - June 1.

As you know from Lance and Alex, this is an opportunity to meet university
researchers and industrial members of PSERC. The meeting also has
presentations on PSERC activities and research projects, PSERC business
discussions, current topic discussions, and a tutorial. Our current topics
discussion will be on ISO/RTO issues, and will involve executives from
several ISOs in dialog with university researchers.

Please let me know if you have any questions. We hope to see you there so
that we can talk about any questions you might have about PSERC.

Dear Mr Kaminski

I am delighted to say that the printed conference brochure is now available 
and our logistics team will be mailing them out, along with the speaker 
guideline packs (including information on hotel discounts etc), in the next 
couple of weeks. You will also no doubt receive copies via our main mailing 
campaign.

In the interim, please find attached a shortened pdf copy of the conference 
brochure for your perusal. (I did not want to send you the complete 12 pages 
as it would clog up your email!) The full colour version can be found on our 
website at www.icbi.uk.com/powerisk

I hope you agree that the speaker plenum and line-up of topics is possibly 
one of the best ever and not surprisingly the event is already drawing strong 
international interest. In particular the Executive Summit Day on e-Business 
and Power Trading is taking numerous bookings. I would be happy for you to 
attend either the Summit Day or one of our two intensive post conference 
workshops, but in order to avoid overcrowding on the day ask that all 
reservations be made in advance.

I am certain that you have friends or colleagues who would be interested in 
attending the conference this year, and would like to ask that you email the 
enclosed details to them. To make things easy, I have attached a booking form 
which should be faxed to +44 20 7915 5101. ICBI would be happy to offer a 10% 
discount on registrations received through speaker recommendations.

Finally for any enquiries relating to travel or hotel matters please contact 
our logistics manager Clare Capel on +44 20 7915 5198. Of course for any 
programme related issues, please drop me an email or call me on +44 20 7915 
5194.

I look forward to seeing you in October for what promises to be excellent and 
informative week.

all members of the USAEE that reside in the central Texas area. Please plan 
to meet David DeAngelo, President of USAEE, who we are fortunate to have as 
our special guest. David will be happy to answer any questions you have about 
the IAEE and USAEE.

About the CTAEE

The Central Texas Association for Energy Economics (CTAEE) focuses on current 
energy events and research at the state, national, and international level.  
It is an excellent forum to meet, network, and exchange ideas in the regional 
energy community.  Local programs will be held six to eight times a year.

The CTAEE is a local chapter of an international association known as the 
International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE).  CTAEE is a non-profit 
organization and is a totally non-partisan forum for stimulating discussion 
and dialogue on major energy policy and analysis issues.  To provide 
exceptional meeting topics and dialogue we need your local membership.  Your 
participation in CTAEE can bring new ideas to help promote effective energy 
policy.

About the IAEE and USAEE

The International Association for Energy Economics (IAEE), founded in 1977, 
provides a forum for the exchange of ideas, experience and issues among 
professionals interested in energy economics. Its scope is worldwide, as are 
its members, who come from diverse backgrounds -- corporate, academic, 
scientific, and government. The United States Association for Energy 
Economics (USAEE) is an affiliate of the International Association for Energy 
Economics.  As a member of IAEE you will gain a broader understanding of 
energy economics, policymaking and theory. Members are kept well informed by 
IAEE and USAEE publications and conferences on events within the energy 
industry and energy challenges that lie ahead. Furthermore, membership 
provides you with the opportunity to network within the largest association 
of energy professionals in the world.

Helyette,

I m very sorry to disappoint you. I have just learned I have to be in Houston
during the
last few days of June and the first few days of July. A transaction is likely
to close, and I have to be available in case my services are needed.  I hope
it will not disrupt the planning for the conference too much.

I am leaving for Boston tomorrow: RISK2000 Conference, with Myron Scholes and
my boss, Jeff Skilling, speaking on the opening day.

I shall talk to Karla Feldman before my departure about the contract. I hope
we shall be able to close soon.

Vince

Dear Vince

Thank you for your recent enquiry concerning a complimentary pass to the
two-day GARP Convention. Unfortunately, it is not GARP's policy to allow
this for a number of reasons: GARP is a not-for-profit organisation, will
much lower delegate fees (and still the same overheads) than other
conference organizers. GARP's mission is to allow an educational forum for
furtherance of financial risk management and an opportunity to allow
networking and contact time between financial risk professionals. However,
in an attempt to remain at ease with my speakers, I would like to offer a
50% discount off the delegate fee for one of you colleagues in Enron. This
will be for the two-day Convention and will include the Gala Awards Evening
on 13th February, which had over three financial and risk professionals at
GARP 2000.

I trust that this is satisfactory. If you would like to take advantage of
this, please fax a completed registration form, along with a brief covering
note referring to this e-mail, and I will ensure that our administration
depart handle the relevant paper work. If you have any questions please do
not hesitate to contact me.

I look forward to your response and to meeting you in New York in February
(and receiving a copy of your presentation in a few days).

Kind regards

Andreas

Dear GARP 2001 Speaker

This is just a quick note to keep you up-to-date  with developments at the
GARP 2001 Convention, which will be  held in New York between 12th and 15th
February, 2001.

Thus far, GARP 2001 looks set to far exceed our  expectations and GARP
2000. There has been a great deal of interest in the 2001  Convention.
Delegate bookings have been much higher than this time last year. As  a
result, we are set to far exceed the number of delegates that attention
earlier this year. The three workshops and the one-day Asset Management
Forum  are also very well received and will probably reach full capacity. I
will of  course provide you with much fuller details closer to the time of
the  event.

Regarding the event itself, I would like a few  outstanding issues:

1. Presentations: can you please  e-mail your presentation to me by 15th
December, so that I have  enough time to reproduce them and place them in a
delegate pack for the  Convention. (Given the break of the Christmas and
New York period, and that the  event is being held in New York, I am sure
you can appreciate that there are  certain logistical factors that need to
be taken into account, hence the reason  why the presentations are required
as soon as possible). This is purely for  reproduction, we also request you
bring your presentation to the Convention  on the day in either a floppy
disc or a laptop.

2. Audio-Visual Requirements: can  you please inform me of what
audio-visual requirements you may have (35mm  slides; OHP; LCD projection -
notably PowerPoint).

3. Check list: I have attached a  check list for your information. If you
have not returned this already, can you  please read and fax it to my
colleague, Claire as soon as possible.

If you have any questions or queries, please do not  hesitate to contact
me, otherwise I eagerly await your response in due  course.

I look forward to seeing you in New York in  February.

Kind regards

Andreas

Frank,

I have reviewed materials from GARP but did not find any information
about the speaker's perks (like, for example, the right to invite another 
person,
free of charge).

I shall message GARP with this question.

Please, give me a few more days to think about GARP presentation.

Subject:  Invitation to speak at Infocast's Managing Summer Price Volatilit
      y Conference in Houston


Dear Ms. Kaminsky:
As I just mentioned on your voicemail, Infocast is going to host a
Managing
Summer Price Volatility course, January 30 - February 1, 2001 in Houston.
The course will focus on the various tools at hand to manage summer price
and load volatility.  Our target audience for this event will primarily be
risk managers and managers in bulk power sales & purchase (our secondary
target audience is energy traders).

Attached you will find a draft program agenda for your review.  Please let
me know if you or someone else at Enron is interested in presenting at this
event.  In particular, we are looking for someone to talk about weather
derivatives.

I appreciate you taking the time to review the conference schedule and I
hope that I will have an opportunity to talk to you. Unfortunately, I am
running behind schedule in finalizing this program.  I will call tomorrow
to
see what your feedback is.  If you have any questions or suggestions,
please
do not hesitate to contact me at (818) 888-4445 ext. 30.

Sincerely,

Britta Bothe

Options
      Perspective


Dear Mr. Kaminsky,

As I mentioned on your voice mail, Infocast is going to host an ?Valuing
Electric Power Assets and Companies: A Real Options Perspective? conference
to be held on July 31- August 2, 2000, in Chicago, IL - I would like to
explore your or your organization's possible participation at this event
with you.  This conference has been designed to bring together industry
professionals, like you, to provide the latest details on a "Real Options"
approach to electric power asset valuation.

I have attached a draft program outline for your review.  If you or someone
else at your company is interested in presenting on one of the topics please
let me know.

I truly appreciate your taking the time to review the conference schedule
and hope that you will consider participating.  I am running behind schedule
in finalizing this program.  I will call you on tomorrow to follow up with
you on this invitation.  In the meantime, if you have any questions or
suggestions, please do not hesitate to contact me at (818) 888-4445, ext.
30.  I hope you can join us for this event.

Sincerely,

Britta Bothe

Dear Vince,

Would you mind emailing to me a short biography/vita sometime when you get
a chance?  Also, if you have a paper to circulate or any PowerPoint slides
that you'll want to use either in your presentations to my students
Thursday afternoon, 2/3, or to the faculty seminar on Friday morning, 2/4,
please email these to me.  This would be greatly appreciated.

My colleagues and I are looking forward to your visit on Feb. 3-4 to LSU.

Sincerely,

Jim Garven

Vince,

 I've distributed the info on the course. Gary Taylor, the head of marketing 
said that there were perhaps two people he'd like to send, and he thought 
that the teachers would be able to benefit from having people from the 
weather derivatives desk in attendance, but that the price of $1100 a person 
was too steep. Gary (being the head of marketing that he is) would like to 
see if there would be some special deal that could be arranged for people 
from the weather desk, but he doesn't want to cross the line.

Joe

This is the most recent offer from Lacima
(weather derivatives course). What do you think?

Vince,
Enron is fine (although I think we have to pay for the Hyatt anyway).
 
Good discount (I have a feeling that my idea of a good discount and the  
weather desk's idea is probably different?):  for the one day, $1100 per  
person.  If you think that there will be around 10 people or more,  then we 
can offer a day rate, regardless of the number of people.  
 
Thanks Vince
 
Julie
 
PS - Of course when I announced that we were cancelling, people started  
responding that they wished to attend.  Ugh!

Julie,

Enron location makes more sense. No reason to  pay for the hotel.
Also, I think that one day makes more sense.

I  contacted the weather desk about including other people at the  training
course. I think that they would be interested if they got a good  discount.

Vince,

Great. Just to let you know,  we decided not to wait on the indecisive
ones, and postponed the open  course. It's yours, whatever you want:   1
day (specific to what you  feel will be of the most benefit), 2 days, Hyatt
or  Enron, or not at  all. I hope this doesn't cause problems for you.
Special deal, for sure. I  owe my godfather.

Julie

That's definitely an option.

We  can  provide the room. Maybe we can cut with you a special deal  for
Enron
and  increase the # of people attending. I am forwarding  your message to
our  weather  desk.

Vince

Joe,

What do you think about   it?

Vince,

We just wanted to let you  know  that we only have 3 people signed up for
the
weather  derivatives course  (all from Enron) so far. We have a couple  more
that have expressed strong  interest, but we are awaiting their  final
decision. If no one else signs  up, Chris and Les thought that  you guys
could probably get through the  first day pretty easily, and  thus thought
it
may be an option to teach just  the 2nd day  material (pricing) only at
Enron
(doing it at the Hyatt is an   option as well but the room might be on the
large side)? We would   obviously reimburse you for the day not taught. We
can teach both days  as  well, but thought you may want to save some time.

I just  wanted to give  you some time to think about it. We will know where
we  stand on final  numbers by next   Wednesday.

Julie

Subject: PSERC IAB - Who We Are


One of the things I would like to accomplish over the next few weeks is for
we IAB members to build a better working relationship. There have been many
changes to PSERC over the past year, as well as many new IAB members
joining with their universities. I've felt that I don't know most of the
IAB members and that makes it difficult for me to feel like I'm adequately
representing your needs to the PSERC Executive Committee. I hope to meet
many of you in Denver and get to know you better, but I think we all need
to know each other better. I have an idea that might help us and it will
only take five minutes of your time.

If you could take the time to fill out the following short questionnaire
and email it back to me then I'll compile a list and distribute it to you.
Depending upon when you respond I might be able to hand it out in Denver,
but I'll be sure to email you a copy later if I have to. This is, of
course, perfectly voluntary, so if you're not interested its Okay. If you
want to respond via a telephone call, I'm at 607-762-8825.

email this back to me at sjdemarco@nyseg.com and copy Dennis Ray at
djray@engr.wisc.edu.

Thank you very much,  Steve De Marco (IAB Chair)
