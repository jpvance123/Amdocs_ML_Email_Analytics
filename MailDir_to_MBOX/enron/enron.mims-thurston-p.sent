So hello,

What happened at rehearsal last night?  I did not make it, partly because I 
was tired and I had several errands to take care of.  I needed to stop by 
K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed, and 
just did not want to be out late.

Let me know!!!

Talk to you later.

P.S. is everthing else going okay?

Hi Jeannie,

Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time 
employment. I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop 
you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within 
the company.  I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a 
strong interest in part-time employment.  Please let me know if anything 
comes up, and also if we need to meet.

I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( 
please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position 
on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm 
interested in part-time employment.  I've casually mentioned this to him in 
the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.

Thanks for your help!

Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me 
yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as 
well?

I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to 
be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to 
talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the 
last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I 
always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The 
number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but 
anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my 
business card.

Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.

Talk with you soon.

So nice to hear from you.  Everything here is hot, hot, hot, 107 degrees 
today.  Nothing new going on here, the boys are doing great, just getting 
really big.  I'm taking Kendall to the Dr. today to see if he has an ear 
infection, he was up most of the night last night (rats!).  Jordan is so 
cool, he taking gynmastics again and loving it.  Kendall is my little 
roughneck!, he reminds me of myself, he's hysterical.  I am so glad I have 
them!!!!

The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun, I think it's just going to be 
Mom, Me and Nelle I think.   I'm leaving the kids with Todd.  Todd has a new 
job where he works 12 hour shifts.  In fact, he's working with Ken Cowan,  
but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am,  It sucks when he's 
working nights, but he really likes it.

Anyway, we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to 
roll.  Anyway take care, talk with you soon!

Subject: Crestar AOS assignment to BP


Dan, Grant Oh suggested I e-mail you directly to notify you of a change
that BP needs included. BP states they need to have the volumes/contract
number information back from Enron via e-mail by 9:45am MST in order to
place nominations by 10:30am MST for the Timely Cycle. If for whatever
reason Enron cannot provide the volume/contract number information by
9:45am or Enron fails to take the scheduled volume agreed to at 9:00am; and
BP incurs any penalty costs including the price difference between the
Enron price and the replacement price, then Enron should be liable for
these costs NOT Gulf. I suggest the following options:

1) Put back in the default contract number in the Enron/Crestar agreement
as we had last week, this way if Enron fails to notify by 9:45am, then
Crestar/BP can nominate to the default contract number and Enron can change
the contract numbers internally.
2) Add a clause to either the Enron agreement or the Gulf assignment
agreement to state if Enron fails to inform and/or take, then any penalty
costs/price difference incurred by Crestar/BP shall be passed onto Enron.

Please advise what Enron's position is and how we should proceed.

What's Happening?


How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get 
my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you 
spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I 
don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  
Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch 
with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.

This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and 
still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it 
gets dark.

Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?

Talk with you later!

Just tried to call you.  Please call me before you leave, and yes, you 
probably need to leave, but where will you go?

If you go straight hme, emotions are running too high for it to be a safe 
environment right now.  I'm not trusting his reactions or your own right 
now.  You are hurting and sometimes that will cause us to do things that we 
normally would not do.  Please do not put yourself in that position!!!!

Hey Rev. Jackson,

Hello sir, how are you?  Well, I tell you Pastor really outdid himself 
yesterday.  I really enjoyed his sermon.  He really has a knack for weaving a 
story and making it applicable to today's events, etc.

Tasha and I got so tickled, watching you sing that song.  You did very well.  
We said, "Look at Rev. Jackson, he's jammin".

Well, anyway, talk to you later!

Hey Sugar Bear!


I was just thinking about you and was hoping that everything is going okay 
for you.  I constantly keep you in prayer regarding your situation.   How's 
Erika doing?

You missed church Sunday when they forceably removed one of the guys (aaron 
Burr) from the church.  You remember he was the one that used to sit on the 
front row and get happy alllllllllll the time.  You remember him, anyway they 
hauled his tail out of there.  It was terrible to see someone hauled from the 
church, not matter what the situation is.

Oh well, take care, and call me if we need to talk!!!!

Hey girl,

I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!  It's been up 
and down over here, but I'm hanging!  Hope everything is going well with 
you.  Did the kids enjoy Halloween?  My kids sure did.  I did not realize 
that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.  I wasn't 
going anyway!  

Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be 
back on Sunday afternoon.

Talk with you later.

Yes, she'snot familiar with the music, but said she would listen to the music 
and see what she thought, but I have put in a call to my other friend, but I 
know she would do it if her schedule was open, but she does is 
professionally, and I know there would be a charge,  I should hear something 
today from my other friend.

Jesus,

Please show me a bid for this Cargill Deal.  It is 25 MMBtu/d day, 
May-October, 2001 with balancing and anything else that typically goes along 
with it.  I think the best option at this time is just ot get a bid from you.

Also there is a piece at Nicor that goes along with it, but it is a monthly 
volume commitment, and does not include balancing.  I don't plan to give you 
that portion, but it may be that the customer does not want it broken up.  
The volume is roughly 33,000 for the month.



Thanks

On December 21, 2000,  I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 for gas 
flow on  December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76.   This price was increased to $16.00 to encompass trades transacted 
via the telephone. 

The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company was closed for  their company holiday on Friday, December 
22nd.  As a result, volumes delivered at Nicor were traded for  the December 
22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published a price of $15.70 for the December 
22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made a decision to buy gas on December 
22nd (even though they were closed)  for the December 23-26 time period, 
which resulted in a $13.88 posting for the December 23-26th period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, 
from time-to-time, there will be significant volumes transacted over the 
telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little 
over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to 
intentionally reporting erroneous information.

Give me another couple of days, we're still checking.  Did I tell you that 
Carol told me she was waiting on a $1.5 million loan to come through so she 
could pay for Shawna's wedding, as well as take care of her business.   So 
you know we may get down there and there may not be a big wedding, (girl, you 
know how that goes, now who in the hell is going to lend her that kind of 
money?)   You know Carol and Shawna are doing some type of financing of real 
estate, or something like that.  Ralph West came to our groundbreaking 
ceremony we had on Sunday and delivered a sermonette.  He is awesome.  I told 
him I enjoyed his sermon, and he mentioned that he was leaving for Omaha the 
next day.  Do you have acrobat on your computer?  I'll try to send you 
picture to see if it comes out.


Talk with you later.

Hey Nella,

When I got in this morning, I had received an e-mail from Daddy on last 
Friday.  He said that everything was okay financially  for the future, and 
they only had an immediate need for the tax money.  He sounded okay with me 
asking about it.  He even said "You are so sweet with words".

He just doesn't realize, but we get that ability from him.

How was your weekend, mine was good, we spent alot of time outside.  We went 
to the B-Day party and the kids bowled and boy did Kendall love bowling.  In 
fact Jordan, ny athletic one, bowled a strike.  They call it bumper bowling 
because they put up little bumpers.  All the kids enjoyed it so much, Natasha 
and I are going to take the kids back in a couple of weeks and let them bowl 
one day after we get off work.  Bowling alleys notoriously have good food.  
Yesterday, we went to the park and spent several hours outside, it was like 
in the low 80's yesterday.  I'm glad daylight savings time is here, its so 
nice to be able to get home and get things taken care of before it gets dark.

This morning, I went to drop the kids off at the daycare at 6:30 a.m. (mind 
you, I'm running about 10  minutes late) and the daycare teacher (the wife of 
one of Todd's good friends) that opens up the facility (she's the only one 
with a key) was late again.  Now the heffa was late one day last week and I 
didn't say anything, beccause everyone is late every once in awhile, but she 
made me late for work last week.  So...I blew up this morning and had to 
leave the kids standing in the parking lot with about 3 other teachers and 6 
other parents with their kids.  I want to call up their and complain, but I 
think I'll talk with her first (maybe!)    She needs to get her stuff 
together, because first thing in the morning is not a time to play with folks.


Talk with you later

Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know 
you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab 
over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the 
baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to 
spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the 
regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said 
something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  
Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call 
you on the way home.

See ya!

Hey Melba,

Company located in Will County, Illinois

Thanks so much and sorry for the rush!!!!

Hi Mark,

I would like to creat a product for Enron Online for trades on Alliance 
Pipeline.  As you probably know, Alliance is a new pipeline scheduled to 
start commercial service effective November 13, 2000.  As with any new 
pipeline, this date may or may not be pushed back to a later date.   I would 
like to create a product that has a description that addresses the 
uncertainty of the start-up date of Alliance Pipeline and simply states that 
gas will commence flowing when the pipeline goes commecial.

Please let me know if you have language that addresses this situation.

I would like to get this product set up as soon as possible.

Thank you

Sorry, it took so long!  It's kind of hard to say, but just say that during 
an altercation ......, but you do not have to say with who, I really don't 
know, but let me know what you come up with.  How much detail  are they 
looking for with the Police report!

I really don't remember the name, but it was a man.  He specifically quoted 
dollar amounts of $9,475.808.18 vs. $9,298,971.71.  Hope this helps!

Hey Bossman,

We're still waiting on Kam to provide the P.V. Factors, she's having trouble 
locating, but we have the spreadsheet almost complete.

I'll send it as soon as she gets the values.

Hi Roni

Charnella had asked that I send you information regarding scooters.

The outfit is called Scoot Around North America.  They have a web site at 
www.scootaround.com.  Their phone number is 1-888-441-7575.

Hope this works out for you.

Take Care!

I'm sorry, I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m.  I thought I had 
responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay, but I checked my 
e-mails and discovered that I did not respond.   Anyway, my fault, what's 
good for you next week?  ( I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back, 
instead of just putting it on my calendar.)

Thanks

So nice to hear from you.  I miss not being able to see you and talk with you 
on a regular basis.  I hope the kids are dong fine.  Jordan went to 
children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor.  He just 
starts smiling when I mention her name.  That little mannish boy already 
likes girls, I think.    Anyway, things are going okay, I'm still leaning 
toward trying to find a part-time position next year.  This job is so very 
hard!

Take care!

Sorry, it took so long to respond to the e-mail.  Hope, you guys are doing 
well!  
Yes, I'm interested in receiving the address list for the attendees!  We 
really need to get something out pretty soon to the people.  Grandpa says 
people are calling, (I wonder if its just one or two people), but 
nevertheless, we still need to get something out.

Talk with you soon!

For December 21, 2000 activity, I reported a weighted average price of $16.00 
for activity for December 22-26, 2000.

The weighted average trade price via Enron Online will reflect a price of 
$15.76, but coupled with the volume not transacted online, this price was 
estimated to be a $16.00 midpoint.  Specificially the following trades were 
transacted over the telephone:

Nicor Gas Company  $18.16  20,000  Via ANR @ Hampshire
Altrade    GDD +.05 10,000  NGPL Nicor
WPS    GDD    5,000  NGPL Nicor
Nicor Gas Company  $12.00  20,000  NGPL Nicor
PG&E    $14.00   9,000  NGPL Nicor
Kaztex    $18.16       4,000  NBPL/Nicor

 
The reason for the interest in this time period is as follows:

Nicor Gas Company observed their company holiday on December 22nd, while most 
companies observed the company holiday on December 26th.  As a result, 
volumes were traded for the December 22-26 time period.  Gas Daily published 
a price of $15.70 for the December 22-26 time period.  Nicor Gas Company made 
a decision to buy gas on December 22nd for the December 23-26 time period.  I 
received several phone calls from various marketing companies expressing 
concern that Gas Daily was going to revise the posting, based on the minimal 
activity that transacted on December 22nd.  

While, my practice is to simply take the price as reported on Enron Online, 
from time-to-time, the there will be significant volumes transacted over the 
telephone that will impact the Enron Online price.  My volume  is a little 
over-stated, but simply  from a cursory glance standpoint, as opposed to 
intentionally reporting erroneous information.

Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young 
people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If 
there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help 
with the kids or anything.

Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick 
alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big 
Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!

You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That 
is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real 
good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
 We need to shop together more often.

Yes, I will be at choir tonight.

See you then!

Daddy,

I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted 
to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.  


I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for 
you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from 
me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!

Love Bernie!

Hey girl,

What's happening?  Girl, remind me, just in case I have a memory lapse, that 
I will never, ever go back over to that church again.  It's a nice, small 
church, but those folks crack me up.  Last time I went, Sharon Mahon, sat 
next to me and just really acted a fool and had me roaring.  This time, those 
fools sitting by me (audrey and Doren) had me laughing, especially Audrey.  
They're fools!  I was so embarassed that my chuckle came out!  So, just 
remind me, I will never go back over there.   I sure hate that you missed 
seeing the baptismal pool! 

Boy, what a difference a day makes in the weather.  Last night, Todd cleaned 
out the closet, because of the potential tornado threat.  I was a little 
unnerved, especially with the kids.  I had the kids put on their shoes and 
socks and whatnot, just in case something happened.  I was a praying sister.  
That really scared me.  Then, to top it off, the weather got really cold this 
morning!  Oh well, talk with you later!

Hey Robert,,

Sorry I was out on vacation, and I did not think to ask Todd the name of his 
headhunter, but I will and try to get back to you with some names this week.

Take care!

The rest of that list is misleading, etc. etc. etc.!

Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well 
I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really 
meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 
11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall 
Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!

Scott,

Finally, here's the resolution on the Coenergy invoice for April, 1999.

Coenergy is telling me that the we need to pay the difference $2.90 vs. $2.74 
on 10,000 MMBtu per day.  If this is true, please pay the difference of 
$0.155 to Coenergy on a volume of 10,000 MMBtu per day for April, 1999.

If your understanding is different, please let me know, but otherwise please 
pay the difference.

Thank you for your patience, and sorry it took so long to resolve.

That's so sweet of you to let me know, but we will not be there this weekend, 
we just went about two weekends ago.   I'm thinking about taking the kids to 
this farm out in my part of town.  My understanding is that it is open to the 
public, but I'm trying to get the name of the place.  Diane Cook has taken 
her kids there, so I'll let you know more about it when I receive the info.   
Jordan has decided that he wants to help feed the farm animals!!!!  (He'll 
probably be scared to death once we get there!)

I noticed Kreme had their Halloween party at school yesterday.  What costumes 
did the kids where?

Hi Nellie,

What's happening?  I sent you and Momma some new pictures of the boys, if you 
have not received yet, you should receive either today or Tuesday.  I made 
the hotel reservations for Phoenix at the Embassey Suites, the rate is 
$159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the Nascar is in town, and we can 
split it three ways.  Hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, 
although I did not ask, I asked for two queen beds, in case there is not.  
Now I just need to get the car reserved and we're all set.  I spoke with 
Shawna on Friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see 
if she could improve that rate, so far I have not heard anything back from 
her yet, nor am I holding my breath.  She said her colors are burgundy and 
gold, if I remember correctly.  

Jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that 
Jordan was so good, that he would like Jordan to be in an accelerated class 
for his age group.  This class is called the "Hope Team"  and it gets the 
kids ready for competition.  I did not realize he was that good, although I 
could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud Mom).  I called to 
inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me" Ma'm you have 
to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and I said, yes, 
ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!" 

Well, anyway, we'll  see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day.  
We'll see, I know he would really enjoy it.
Kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning October 23rd.  I 
was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more I think about it, he'll 
probably want to be in Jordan's class (oh boy!!).

I spoke with Daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly 
getting tickets to come down for Thanksgiving.  Let me know what you're 
hearing?  Talk to you later.

What's happening?  I know you've been busy, I remembered that Thursday night 
is Ciera's (spelling?) review night.  Everything is well here at work and at 
home.  I 'm leaving early today, probably, around 3:00 p.m.  We've had a 
pretty good week and we're ready to go home and start over next week..  Next 
week is really supposed to be cold here and in the Midwest, so it will really 
be a busy work week.

  I think I might try to stop at the mall sometime today, whether it be late 
tonight (you know they're open until 11:00 p.m. I think) or right after 
work.  I will pick up a gift certificate from Victoria's Secret for Samantha 
if I make it out.   Do you want to go in on it, I was going to spend  about 
$25 (believe me, she is looking for a gift!).

 Have you made a decision on the Christmas Party?  We're still going to mine, 
but girl, we have to take the kids over to Todd's mother and she lives in 
Bear Creek and then drive all the way back to Enron Field.  My regular 
babysitter could not do it.  Anyway, holler at me!

I think we should all stay in the same room, especially if we get a suite at 
embassset suites, with a pull-out bed.  We checked it out and I can get there 
are 7:30 p.m. on America West on Thursday.  The rate is $305.00, a little 
pricey.    Did I tell you that Shawna wants us to come to the rehearsal 
dinner?  I'm trying to figure out when we're going to site see.

Boy, it looks like this is really going to be a tight, tight, race.  As far 
as your other issue, I would just say very professionally, that "there are 3 
subjects that you are uncomfortable talking about, and they are voting, 
religion and salaries." and just keep it at that.  You also might want to 
add" I hope you can respect my stand on these subjects."

That way, you've communicated your desires in a concise, professional 
manner.  

Talk to you later!

Hi there!

Just checking on you.  Did you make it to practice last night and did 
Lucretia's husband keep the kids? (smile).  If so, what time did you get back 
home, I know it was late.  I went to Auchan's last night to try to see what 
they had in the way of western attire for the kids.  They did not have much, 
and the hats for $2.99 were on back order.    I was looking for western 
shirts for the kids, but they did not have a good selection, so I went to a 
Western store on Gessner.  Boy, what a mistake, they were so darn high.  
Regular shirts for kids cost $25 and they were ugly.  I walked out saying 
that these people are serious about their western wear.

I brought in some gospel cds to work today and I've been listening to them on 
my headphones.  It sure helps alot.  I can get away with it, because we have 
certain weather reports that are produced by Enron, that you have to wear  
headphones to hear, so it looks good.  Plus, the boss doesn't mind.  We 
listen to music just about all day anyway.  Have you heard the Chester D.T. 
Baldwin tape.  I think it's one of my favorites.  Speaking of gospel, is your 
family  still planning on  doing a concert at Southwest when they come in for 
the family reunion?  I was wondering about that!

Have you talked to Sharon and offered her your congrats yet, I want to call 
her, but I don't want to make it seem like Hope is telling all of her 
business.  

Talk with you later!

Oh I'm glad you sent me an e-mail because there is no rehearsal 
tonight!!!!!   
Tasha said she saw Taylor in the children's church, and I looked for you in 
the audience, but did not see you.  After church let out, I was gone, I was 
home by 1:15 p.m.  That never happens!  I looked for you guys and I said, oh 
well, I'll catch them later.  

By the way, I'm having Jordan's B-Day party on Monday evening, January 22, 
2000 at the Chuckie Cheese on the Southwest Freeway,  Yes I'm having it on a 
Monday night after work (6:30 p.m.) because I can't stand that place, and 
Jordan has his heart set on it.  It's always too crowded and it drives me 
crazy!  So I figure, we'll meet between 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. and be out of 
there by 8:30 p.m.  It's not the best plan, but it beats a Friday, Saturday 
or a Sunday.  I'm just inviting about 6 people. so it'll definitely be small  
Let me know if you're interested.

See you soon!.

Hi,

How's it going?  You realize we missed our PLAYDAY for the kids this week.  
We need to make sure we get on schedule for next week.  Sometimes the Tuesday 
night choir rehearsal takes so much out of me and the boys, that sometimes we 
spend Wednesday recuperating (i.e. getting the boys and myself to bed 
early).  It's always so much better when Todd is not working and he can keep 
them.  

Girl, what did you think of that Jon P. Kee song that Joe and that girl were 
singing on Tuesday.  The choir really wasn't into that one.  We just could 
not muster up a good sound!   Are you going to the groundbreaking ceremony?  
If so, let's see if some of us want to have lunch together before we head to 
the tent!  I'm 75% sure that I will be attending.

Talk to you later.

Hey girl,

How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two 
days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home 
until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight 
and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the 
grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and 
cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting 
ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was 
exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 
1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was 
tired.

This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would 
like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for 
that.

Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and 
Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.

Talk with you later!

Girl, you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .  Now you know I don't 
know.  It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead.  He probably 
won't spring it on you Sunday, because we did not do that good without you 
there.

I am so tired from last night.  Everything is so rushed, and I did not get 
the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m.  I'm 
tired, so I know they are.  On top of all of that, the market is up another 
$1.00 today (yeah!!), but we have to stay late tonight  to go over our 
positions as a group.  My boss said that we will all stay until it's done, so 
make arrangements.  Naturally, Todd is working the evening shift, so I'm 
trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter.  They just 
live right down the street.  So we'll see!  Talk with you later!

Girl, isn't that sad about the election results and the recount.  It's really 
terrible.  Everybody over here is watching it very, very closely.  They 
really want Bush to win in a bad way.  I'm tired of hearing about it!   How 
are things over your way.

My day yesterday was okay, Todd cooked us dinner before he went to work, I 
was shocked, but appreciative.  I think I might go car shopping this weekend 
if the weather is nice.

Speaking of church, do you know that Robin told m that Greg lives in million 
dollar house?  Remember when Hope said that his light bill was super high, it 
probably was correct!  We'll need to do a "drive-by" one of these days.  I 
want to see this house!

Talk to you later.

So, I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !  Robin and 
Anna have the strangest way of doing things.  I asked Robin at least two 
weeks ago, and she said she had to get with Anna, and now she's telling you 
that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to 
me.  Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again, because 
at this point, I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night, and 
he'll be tired on Saturday (although that's no problem).  But, like last 
time, I don't want to go if you can't go.  Let me try and call her and we'll 
talk later.  So are you free on Saturday?

Also, everything is going okay over here, the market is down severely this 
morning, so we'll see!

Hi Daddy,


 I was thinking about you earlier this morning.  Glad to hear that you are 
not in any pain right now.  We just need to keep pressing to find the right 
combination of medicine.  My experience has been to be very persistent with 
the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot 
with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not 
communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for 
pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines 
that will get the job done.  

I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your 
"breakthrough" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you 
were talking about!

I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach 
for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were 
closed,I forgot about the time difference.  I 'm probably hesitating because 
I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this 
is the right place.  What are your thoughts?

Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt".  Hope 
it's not too painful.

Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.

Is this your home e-mail or your office?

Hi Marlo,

This deal was done on Enron Online, so do we need to get further information 
from Enron Online?

Please let me know?

Hey,

How's it going today?  I've been thinking about you and Siera.  Did things go 
alright last night.  Have you heard any more back from the principals yet, or 
are you not going to know anything until tomorrow?  
I know tonight is study night for her spelling test, so I probably won't talk 
to you tonight.

Rev. Jackson called me yesterday.  I thought that was funny, he said they had 
told him that I was upset about my contribution statement, and he thought he 
would give me a call to apologize and see if he could do anything.  He then 
went on to say that he didn't want any problems or misunderstandings, because 
I was a generous contributor.  I then proceeded to give him a piece of my 
mind, because they need to get serious about the business end of the church.  
By the way, I was talking to Kent the other day, and he mentioned that 
Carolyn Jenkins was no longer at the church.  That's interesting.  I can only 
imagine what happened there!

Anyway, do you have your African attire yet?  I have some, but it's old, and 
I had been thinking about buying something new.  I might go to Sharpstown and 
have a look, but that is not set in stone.  It depends on what type of time I 
have and what type of mood I'm in.  You know we're supposed to wear our 
African attire on Sunday.  You know we have an outing to First Metropolitan 
Church on Sunday at 3:00 p.m.  I'm pretty sure I won't be attending.  I'm 
tired of going to the same places.  We need some variety.  Gregg needs to get 
some new "hook-ups" if he wants people to keep supporting them on the 
outings.  And another thing, I am so sick of singing the same songs.  If we 
have to sing "In the Sanctuary"  one more time, I'm going to throw up.  

I received an e-mail from Lane Bryant with some coupons for 15 or 20% off.  
It said you could only print the coupon once, but I printed it several times, 
and it kept printing, so remind me to give you a coupon.

See you later!!!!!

 Hey Stranger,

  I hope your day is going well. It's been an extremely busy
week for me but I'm still blessed.I thought about you this morning and was
wondering how things were going? Thursday is my day that I'm out in the
field visiting members that are sick and in the hospital. Well, I guess I
won't see you until Sunday, Keep the faith and don't give up.

        Be

        Rev. Jackson

Hi Darla,

Could you please help me out?  Someone from Nicor called me last week and 
said we had a discrepancy for September business.  All he said was that there 
is a difference of $176,836 that we owe them.

Can you give me a general idea of what the discrepancy is?

Thanks for your help.

Yes, Sorry, forgot to mention it to you, but nothing was set in stone.    In 
fact, I initiated the invitation on behalf of me and you.  Are you free?, are 
they free?, I don't even know if I'm free.  What did they say?

Good afternoon Rev. Jackson.

So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured 
out.  Hope your day is going well.  Sometime, please tell me what "A Day in 
the Life of Rev. Jackson" is like at SWCBC.  Do you see alot of people all 
day long (during the day)?  So often, it's hard to picture the church as 
being active all day long.  It just seems like people attend meetings and 
services about twice a week in the evenings.  Funny, how we get perceptions 
in our heads.

My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my "book" 
here at work and it sure feels good.  I've always remembered what you told me 
during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind.  The one that 
I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in 
perfect peace".  I take that with me everywhere I go.


Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.

Appreciate it!

I spoke with Robin last night for a minute.  You didn't tell me how good 
church was on Sunday.   She said Kathy Florence really preached and 
encouraged me to buy the tape!  It must have been awesome!

Anyway, are you going to rehearsal tonight?  How are things going with 
Steve's party and have you set a time yet?  What does he want/need  for his 
birthday?  I know he loves Power Rangers, but is there anything else, maybe 
something you had been planning to buy, (pajamas, underwear, shirt, pants, 
socks, etc.)

Talk to ya!

Hey guys,

Here is the activity sheet for November.  All activity is for the Balancing 
Agreement only!!!!!

I am planning to inject approximately 15,000 MMBtu per day for the rest of 
the month and that should put me in a pretty good position.  Please respond 
when you have a minute.

That's funny, that they still had the same outfit you looked at back in the 
fall.  If I'm not mistaken, the "O" magazine, the one that Oprah Winfrey 
publlishes had a coupon for August Max stores.  I'm not sure iif it was this 
issue or last month, but call the store and see, and it may be worth buying a 
magazine for the coupon.  I'm not surprised about Hope, it was such a late 
night.  See you later

Hi 

I'm reponding on behalf of myself and Hunter Shively.   Hunter will be out of 
the office on Tuesday, and I will have a visitor in the office from Nicor on 
that same afternoon.

Thank you for the invitation!

Hi Melba,

Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:

The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois.

I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting 
for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.

I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.

Thanks Melba!

I spoke with Carol on Friday and supposdly their wedding coordinator found a 
room at Embassy  Suites for $39 per night.  It's supposed to be at I-17 and 
Greenway, wherever that is.   I'll belive that when I see it.   I probably 
will not bring the kids, it just seems like such a hassle.  I can understand 
Mom not wanting to miss work, so it seems like it will be a girls weekend.  I 
have not checked on flight arrangements yet, but I'll let you know.   I still 
want to leave on Thursdat night, so we have time for site seeing.  How much 
was the ticket?

Girl, so now you see!  Karen just has issues!  So how are you doing?  I was 
on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today.

We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion.  The weather 
was great compared to Texas.  Texas is so hot!!  How's Christian doing?  My 
boys are doing pretty good, just growing so fast.

Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance.

See ya!

Hey Girl,

I'm back and I had a wonderful time.  Phoenix is a nice city and very easy to 
get around in.  The weather was a little chillier than Houston, and as a 
result I have a little cold and sore throat.  The wedding was very nice.  The 
wedding itself was in a small church, but somewhat elegant.  The reception 
was "the bomb".  It was in a real nice resort and it was money, money, 
money.  I was really wondering where my cousin got all of the money.  She had 
a reception for around 150 to 250 people.  I'm not good at looking at a crowd 
and judging, but I bet it was around that many folks there.  She had a buffet 
dinner (mainly sandwiches, but they were good), all kind of party favors, 
beautiful cake, 5 layers and each layer was something different, a band, a dj 
and a comedian that had been on BET that they flew in from Dallas.  It was 
really nice.  Again, I hope she did not go into too much debt, but it was 
nice.  She had a really wonderful time and she was a nice-looking bride.  We 
went shopping and sight-seeing.  We even went to go find the grade school 
that we attended and the house that we lived in when we lived in Phoenix  
many, many years ago.  It was alot of fun actually remincescing (you know 
what word I'm trying to say).

Did you go to church Sunday?  If so, how was it?  I really did miss not going 
to church.   How was the rest of your weekend?  Kids and Steve doing okay?  I 
can't wait to see you tomorrow night, it seems likes it been a long time.

Talk to you later.  I will be home tonight, so I'll call you or you call me 
when we get the kids wound down!

Hi Monique,

We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church 
and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay 
products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same 
place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from 
Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to 
send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.

I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, 
and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in 
stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!

  Thank you so much.

Patrice

How are you doing today?  Boy, isn't it cold!!!!!!  I don't think I will be 
at choir rehearsal tonight because of work.  Isn't the Christmas program 
Sunday?  I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.  We've only had two 
non-dedicated practices for the program.

We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double 
Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not 
being able to get in tomorrow morning.  It's supposed to rain or lightly mist 
tonight between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.   The streets are supposed to be 
treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you 
might want to talk with your supervisor  to come up with a contingency plan 
for the weather.

Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!

So nice to hear from, it is indeed always a pleasure.  I can't wait until we 
can get together and have a chance to really chit chat.  We're always so 
busy, "A woman's work is never done".  

I did not go to rehearsal the other night myself, I had a customer in town 
and had to take him out to dinner, since he's one of my biggest customers.

I'm looking forward to my 3 day weekend, are you guys working on Monday, 
President's Day?  I'm off and can't wait.

I will certainly keep you in prayer, my child. 

Love you!!

Hi,

Welcome back, I trust you had a good vacation.Nothing much going on here, 
just huge price moves.

Anyway, everything we well, for the most part.  As far as Alliance gas is 
concerned, the only new information is that the Aux Sable commissioning 
process will not start until Wednesday (last estimate) per Anne Buschal.  So 
make sure to mention to Hunter on Monday, as everyone else should already 
know about it.  Anne's number is 403-517-6270.  She will be calling each 
Morning.

My logon and password is: pmims and louise8mom.  Please look at the Nigas 
Troy Grove Sheet that I have on my computer.

My position should be around 15 long, just enough to cover rolloff for 2 
days.  If its not, please buy/sell to get me close to that number (or 
whatever is best depending on which way the market is going).


P.S. I'm selling to Clark Refining at the Illini Point, 4,000/day @ Sitara # 
436296.  He wants us to keep them on until he calls to tell us otherwise.   
His number is 314-854-9644 Dteve Brown.

I'll be back on Wednesday.

Nothing has happened, it seems like he's trying to stick close to home.  I 
came in on Monday night and went upstairs, because I frankly, did not want to 
talk and did not want to get mad in front of Jordan.   I was furious and I 
still am furious.  Last night we had choir rehearsal, so he was in bed when i 
came back.  I really don't want to talk to him right now.   I'll keep you 
posted, because I will be doing it hopefully, tonight!

See you later.

Cool girl, that'll work out fine.  It sounds like Hope will be attending 
also.  Kenny can't come, so that was disappointing, but I'll see him on 
Saturday for his daughter's party.  Talk with you later.  We need to talk!!!!

Hey Daddy,

What a very pleasant surprise to hear from you in the middle of the day!!!  
Things here are a little exciting, they are asking us to spend the night in 
one of the hotels downtown, as the streets are supposed to ice over tonight.  
So quite naturally, nobody's mind is on work, it's on the weather.  So 
needless to say, I have a little bit of time on my hands.  The boys are going 
over to Grandma Springer's house tonight to spend the night and Todd and I 
will just stay downtown.  I understand that you guys had some bad weather as 
well, I know Mom was out of school.

I will definitely go and get the Tekno dog for the kids, they will enjoy it 
so much.  Kendall celebrated his 2nd birthday yesterday and had fun.  Todd 
bought him a mini basketball goal and he really thinks he's a big boy now.  
It's really cute.  On the other hand, Jordan was feeling a little neglected 
because of Kendall's cake and presents, but he's okay.  It was just  a new 
experience, him not getting anything while his brother gets new toys.

Anyway, I'll send your tape.

See you later and I hope you're still taking your medicine on a timely basis

Love 

Bernie

Alright, I'll check into both places.  I thought you were going to the Dr. 
today?  After I typed this, I said to myself, I guess I could have re--read 
your original memo.

Anyway, how often do you check your e-mail at home, because I can start using 
this to talk to you?

In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
of 1%.

Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
procedure.

Thanks for your help.

P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .

Hey girl,

You didn't tell me that Jennifer changed her name.  I called her cell phone 
and left a message and it gave her real name, not her slave name.  I cracked 
up!  Seems like the older people get, the crazier they get.  That reminds me 
when my mother called herself changing her name from Louise to Louisa.  I 
answered the telephone at her house and they said "Is Louisa there, and She 
said, oh that's for me".  I cracked up!

Anyway, funny thing happened on the way to the forum, no seriously I was 
standing the lobby on Friday, and a young man asked me if my name was 
Patrice.  Turned out he was Birdell's son, Dupree, remember him?  He's back 
down here working for Prostaff delivering boxes.  He's turned into a nice 
looking young man.  I called Dale and spoke with her for a few minutes.  She 
seems to be doing fine, only spoke for a few minutes though.  I'll call her 
back one of these days when I have more time.

Missed you at Jordan's party.  Silly me, I didn't figure it out until 
Saturday that you had Shayla drop off the gift.  I initially thought it was 
from Shayla.

Well anyway, you rolling?

Hey Kenny.

Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it
gave me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's
not real good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer
and I believe it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very
weak, can't walk more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn
out.  Mom has to drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many
places).  He's definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking
regular pain pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain,
which he's in half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight,
but he's in good spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear
him over tje radio, you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really
hard for me to get a true perspective because I know he was trying to put
on his best act, so that I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see
your parents going through this kind of suffering.

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over
matter, along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for
Mom as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really
do.

Talk to you later!

Hi Melba,

While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a 
new product called:  NGPL North Shore Gas Company.

The description should be:

The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North 
Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago.

I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.

Thanks for your help!

P.S.   Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.

Thanks

Hey Lizzie

Nicor is correct, Sitara #664380 s/b changed to reflect a Chicago Gas Daily 
Price flat, while Sitara #664363 s/b reflect a Chicago Gas Daily Price plus 
$0.01.   I have revised both tickets.

Thanks for your help, and also thank Darla.

Hey girl,

How's it going?  Haven't had a chance to talk with you over the last two 
days.  I went to get me hair done on Wednesday night and did not get home 
until 11:00 p.m.  By the time I got the kids to bed, it was almost midnight 
and I was sick about keeping them up that late.  Last night, I went to the 
grocery store, came home and cooked my boys a good meal of ham, macaroni and 
cheese and green beans.  After we relaxed for a while, we started getting 
ready for their baths and we all went to bed around 8:30 p.m.  I was 
exhausted from being out late Tuesday and Wednesday night.  I woke up around 
1:00 a.m. and watched TV for a few minutes and went back to bed.   I was 
tired.

This evening I made a nail appointment.  My nails look like "do-do".  I would 
like to get a new set tonight, but we'll see if we get off early enough for 
that.

Daddy sent me a e-mail today, he had two really bad days on Wednesday and 
Friday, but he's scheduled to go in for more tests today.

Talk with you later!

Please set up the following new delivery points:

1) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Midwestern Gas 
Transmission Company located in Will County, Illinois

2) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Natural Gas 
Pipeline Company of America located in Grundy County, Illinois

3) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Nicor Gas 
Company located in Grundy County, Illinois

4) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Peoples Gas 
Light and Coke Company located in Will County, Illinois

5) The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
Company located in Will County, Illinois

I'd like to have these the Natural Gas Pipeline point set up yet today, as I 
think we will probably start to trade this point tomorrow.

Thank you.

Oh Hope,

So nice to hear from you!  I think about you all the time.  I miss not seeing 
you every Tuesday!  Are you considering coming back any time soon?  If not, I 
certainly understand, we are so "messy".  We just finished "Take it to the 
Bridge" and I can say that it was certainly more organized than last year.  
We performed at 4:00 for about 1 hour and we were free the rest of the day.  
A big improvement over last year, although they wanted us there at 11:00 that 
morning.  I just bought a new truck for me and the kids, a 2001 Chevy Tahoe.  
I really like it, but I'm still trying to get used to driving something that 
big, and it sits so high, whoa!!

I certainly am praying, just as you are, that the kids are doing great and 
everything is going great for you.   We'll have to get together and do a 
"afternoon at the park" with the kids.  Take care.

Love ya!

P.S. Now that I have your e-mail address, I'll e-mail more often!

Hey Girl,

Yes, we had our concert, it was real good, had a very poor turnout, but he 
choir really enjoyed themselves.  Rickey Dillard is a fool!  He's alot of 
fun, and I didn't realize he was gay, but he is.  Everyone says he used to be 
gay, and not he's changed, but......

I spoke with Daddy on Friday, and he asked me where was his e-mail.  I 
haven't heard anything from him as of yet, but I did send him a e-mail asking 
the question.  Did he do his radio program yesterday?

Yesterday, we went to the beach and rented some horses and went horseback 
riding,  Kendall loved it, Jordan was a little skeptical at first, but soon 
got used to the idea.  I myself was a little skeptical, because I had ol' 
Kendall on my horse, and wanted to hold on to the little know on the saddle, 
instead of me, all I had was the reins,  at first I said "the hell with 
this", but it was fun, we'll definitely do it again.

Talk with you later!

Bobbi,


Attached are the final numbers for the interruptible balancing for November, 
2000.  I have also attached a tentative schedule for December, 2000 for both 
the firm and interruptible.  Those schedules will probably be revised once we 
get through December 1st nominations and "boo-boos".

Thanks

How did it go with Lil' Steve.  Were you able to get his fever reduced?  Poor 
thing, I hope he's feeling better.  How Siera?  Well, anyway, just was 
thinking about the kids and thought I'd drop you a line.

Are you rehearsing tonight?

Subject: Coral, CMS and Petro Canada

I have two counterparties that we have invoiced for gas on December 13th - 
Coral and CMS.  In both cases I am being told that this gas is also  being 
invoiced by Petro-Canada and that it was baseload and at a cheaper price than 
what we are invoicing them for.

The deal numbers are  CMS Marketing  #529459 22000 @ 9.10 = $200200.00
    Coral   #529442 8000 @ 8.90 = $71200.00

Both counterparties have stated that they will not pay our invoiced amount.  
Is it possible that these deals should be invoiced to Petro-Canada instead of 
CMS and Coral?  Would you let me know what the resolution is?

Thanks  for your assistance

Hey thanks for the info.   Ann, from Alliance, said that 160,000 MMBtu/d went

Hey Kenny.

Thanks for checking on me.  My trip to Omaha was okay.  On one hand, it gave 
me a real good idea of what type of shape Daddy really is in.  It's not real 
good, but he feels optimistic.  You know he has prostate cancer and I believe 
it has started spreading into the bones.  He's very, very weak, can't walk 
more than 10 to 20 steps without becoming physically worn out.  Mom has to 
drive him everywhere he goes, (he doesn't go that many places).  He's 
definitely has his good days and his bad days.  He is taking regular pain 
pills constantly and has morphine tablets for extreme pain, which he's in 
half the time.  It's really sad.  He's lost alot of weight, but he's in good 
spirits I guess.    To talk to him over the phone or hear him over tje radio, 
you would swear he's in great health.  It's was really hard for me to get a 
true perspective because I know he was trying to put on his best act, so that 
I would not worry.   It's extremely hard to see your parents going through 
this kind of suffering.

He says he going to beat this thing, so alot of times, it's mind over matter, 
along with lots of prayer.

Mom is wanting to quit her job, (she's a teachers aide), but Daddy doesn't 
want her to do it.  Daddy says he's going back to work.  Please pray for Mom 
as well, I know she's scared to death, and doesn't know what to really do.

Talk to you later!

Hi Rev. Jackson

How's it going?  I'm sure I'll be seeing you tonight at choir rehearsal, but 
I was curious if anything new happened on the choir director front?

Let me know if you get this e-mail in time to respond.  I'll be leaving at 
5:00 directly.

See you tonight!

How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Did you receive my response to 
your last e-mail?  I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not.  Nothing new going 
on here.  I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th.  
I really haven't made any plans, but maybe we'll go visit my family in 
Omaha.  It's really hard for me to plan, b/c I may have to work some of the 
week.  I'm not sure yet, so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be 
interrupted.

Church services were  really good this past sunday, Pastor preached a good 
sermon.  

Talk with you later

Hey,

I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there 
you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see 
where it ends up.  

Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just 
as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is 
extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least 
he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot 
that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But 
I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there 
next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to 
drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a 
heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!

Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are 
you off?  

I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, 
but she's hanging in there.

See you later!

As far as vacation, I think we are thinking of going to Virginia Beach, VA. 
and just renting a house on the beach.  I've never been there, but have heard 
a few good things about it.  I'm trying to get more information before I go 
ahead and book a house.  Also, with my dad being sick, I've been somewhat 
reluctant to do it, because we always take a family trip each year.  God is 
good, so he'll probably get a chance to go.  Have you made any plans yet?  If 
you do, make sure and plan something leisurely.

Also, yes, we need to institute the park days and let these kids go CRAZY.  
They all seem to get along real well.

So my girl, has good taste.  I knew she had it in her.  I really, really like 
my Tahoe.  I wish I had bought it sooner.  It took me about a month to get 
used to it, but now I'm rolling.  Tell your sister I said hi, and let me know 
when she's in town again and when ever you guys have some time.  I would love 
to get together again.

Girl, did you see Jesse Jackson on TV.   You know how they have the news on 
around here, and Jesse came on and said, "In order to have a RECOUNT, you 
have to have the FIRST COUNT, and it's not a black and white issue, its a 
wrong or right issue".   Always trying to rhyme!   Can you believe that 
idiot.  I was too embarassed and kind of acted like I wasn't paying attention.

I understand that Jesse is "down for the cause", but his credibility is 
suffering, because he's involved in every DAMN thing.  If you're an authority 
on everything, you cannot be passionate about much at all.  He's something 
else.  He needs to pick his campaigns to bolster up his credibility!!!!

Hi Priscilla,

These deals are a mess,  I remember issues with the deals, but unfortunately, 
can't remember all the details.  I will speak with our Calgary office, as 
well as, our Operations Manager, George Smith, and provide details to you 
ASAP.  Unfortunately, I think the ASAP won't be until Monday, as George Smith 
is out of the office until Monday.

Thanks,

Hi Jewel,

Sorry, I was not available to visit with you when you called the other day, 
but things have been extremely busy around here, and plus, there is very 
little room for privacy.

In answer to your question, there are no special requirements.  Back in the 
day, they would have been looking for actual pipeline scheduling experience, 
but anymore, the liquidity for gas schedulers is so low, that they will 
consider most people, with an analytical or coordinative type background.  I 
think it's one of those things that once you "get your foot in the door", you 
can move on from there.

Just be aware, that if you were to become a gas scheduler, it may require 
working on weekends, and late nights from time to time.

As far as the next step, I would suggest that you just simply send an e-mail 
to George Smith, Manager of Logistics on the Central Desk, and ask him if he 
has time to visit with you.  I think that by simply expressing an interest, 
and learning what his expectations are of a scheduler, and also, learning 
what you can expect to learn from him, should serve as the first step.   
Also, if he is interested, and does not have a position currently open, then 
he will pass on your name to some of the other managers.  They're actually 
pretty good about that!  I'll mention to George that you may give him a call.

Let me know if you have any further questions, or want to visit some more!

Take care!
