Conferring with Gorte, we need a new DASH for the India sale due to 
1) the time since signing (5 months)
2) downward change in purchase price
3) general change in circumstances of Enron
 
In addition to updating the numbers (as we discussed this morning), we should include
an ownership structure diagram and a legal risk memo concerning what bankruptcy 
related approvals are required (if any).
 
Whether or not Board approval is required is possibly an open issue. We will research.

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee. However, because these buses passes are fully subsidized they must be treated as "taxable" income. Excluding the first $65 of the bus pass, the remaining value is subject to taxation, collectively referred to as "imputed tax". See example below

Example: A $100 pass is chosen by an employee. 

Subsidy for Bus Pass		$100.00
Exclusion amount			$  65.00

Taxable Income amount		$  35.00

Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

Payables

Effective today, the responsibility for Accounts Payables has been moved to Global Strategic Sourcing under the leadership of George Wasaff.  He, along with the Accounts Payable team, is pleased to announce a number of system enhancements based on your valuable feedback.

Delegation of Authority 
iPayit now enables you to identify a delegate to code, review, or approve invoices on your behalf.  The system provides you with the flexibility to:
*  Identify a delegate as a coder, approver, or reviewer
*  Define the length of time that you would like to delegate your authority
*  Select whether the delegate will assume your approval amount, maintain their own approval amount, or assume a specific approval amount

Incorrect Company Code
Incorrect company code?  No problem!  The invoice will no longer return to Accounts Payable for correction before you are able to code the invoice.  iPayit enables you to select the correct company code and continue coding.

Additional Enhancements
*  In addition to Quick Forward, you can now Quick Approve invoices
*  Invoice comments can now be easily viewed from your in-box

Introducing iPayit
With so many new systems, you told us that it was easy to confuse Payables with iBuyit eProcurement.  To help clear up that confusion, we are pleased to announce that this new and improved version has a new name:  iPayit.  
*  To access iPayit, visit the iBuyit Portal or http://iPayit.enron.com.
*  Look for e-mail notifications from <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.  

Sneak Peak
For a preview of the enhancements and how to use them, click on the link below:
http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/ipayitsyspres.ppt

This is just the beginning!  We have created a committee that is dedicated to improving the Accounts Payable process.  We hope to engage you in this effort and plan to actively seek your involvement and input.  We look forward to working with and hearing from you about future enhancements that will enable iPayit to play a valuable role in your invoice payment activities.

For invoice payment status please call the AP Call Center at (713) 853-7127 or toll free  (866) AP ENRON, or send an e-mail to <mailto:ipayit@enron.com>.

FROM ROB WALLS AND JOHN ALE:

We have just discussed a few items with the commercial team and Rockne and have come to the following compromise as matters relate to "Subsidiaries":

"Subsidiary" will include all entities owned or controlled 50% or more by Gipper.  That will pick up several unconsolidated entities, either because of a high economic interest or control of the board of a general partner (e.g., Azurix, EOTT).  All matters disclosed in Gipper's SEC filings or filings by significant subs that file their own public reports (e.g., Azurix, EOTT) will be exceptions to every representation.

Section 5.7, insofar as it applies to any balance sheets, will include consolidated subsidiaries only.  (Note that the rep might expand to include financials on unconsolidated entities that file separate SEC reports).

All items in Section 5.22 are being deleted other than clause (iii), but will continue to pick up VP and above.  In other words, the contract list needs to show  deals of $500,000 or more with officers of Gipper and Subsidiaires (50% or more ownership or control) in which an officer at VP or above personally has an interest.

Also, in listing matters, please recall that materiality is defined with reference to Gipper and its subs taken as a whole.  That's a very high threshhold.

Thanks.

Subject:	Update:  Recommendations from 9/18 Meeting on Transaction Expense Controls / Delegations of Authority

Below please find a summary of recommendations from a meeting held Tuesday between Chip Schneider, Joe Deffner and Wes Colwell.  It is contemplated that these or similar recommendations will be implemented to control capital and other expenditures related to transaction development within the Americas:

Regional Managers within the Americas (East, West, Canada, Mexico, South America) shall be generally accountable for capital expenditures and other expenses associated with transaction development in their respective regions.
The Regional Manager shall designate one Transaction Leader (Director level or higher) for each individual transaction under consideration and shall be accountable to the Regional Manager.  The Transaction Leader or Regional Manager shall be the only parties authorized to obligate Enron or its affiliates under any contract or to transfer money.
Legal shall provide copies of all draft documents to Accounting, Global Finance and Underwriting.
The Deal Leader shall be responsible for drafting initial DASH, seeking buy-in from management and establishing a time-table for expenditure approval.
The initial draft of the DASH and economic model shall be provided to Underwriting at least ten business days prior to any movement of money (more time may be necessary if financing or ENE BoD approval is required).
Legal shall provide a final Legal Risk Memorandum to Underwriting prior to circulation of DASH.
Global Finance shall provide a final FASH to Underwriting prior to circulation of DASH.
Underwriting shall be responsible for DASH circulation.
Underwriting shall promptly provide Accounting with fully executed DASH to set approved budget limits.
Accounting shall keep records of all expenditures, maintain responsibility for approved budget compliance and sign-off on all contracts and money transfers prior to execution.

Let me know what further thoughts you have.

Chip Schneider

It is time for you to step in and force an internal transfer. You and I know this has gone on far too long and needs to be transferred to EGAS's books.

I will bring this issue up with EGAS management - - will revert with their feedback on this internal accounting transfer (i.e., no new cash to Enron) as well as the trasnfer of associated interest gonig forward, etc.  We need to consider the potential effect to Enron of this internal transfer from the perspective of legal strategies as well as current restructuring efforts with the lenders.  

On another matter: have not heard from you regarding the Venezuela trading assistance (from Vengas).  

Thanks, Mariella

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.

Louise:  We are attempting to revise the Watch Report from the 7 to 8 page narrative report that has evolved to a streamlined two page analysis.  The results for EWS are attached as a draft report.  Before we make a wider distribution to other executives in EWS, I would really appreciate your comments and/or suggestions for improvement.  The Principal Investment assets have been pulled out and placed in a similar report that has been furnished to Kevin G.

Thanks for your help!

Tim/Mary/Naveen,

David Port and I are working with Accenture to benchmark and analyze our Liquidity and Collateral Management Process.  We have asked them to analyze the metrics currently utilized at Enron relative to our internal needs and relative to other leading companies.  During this process they may wish to meet with the two of you to gain a better understanding of the Treasury group's Liquidity management process.

Please advise if you have any questions before I give them the go ahead to contact you regarding this project.

Bill

TOWN HALL MEETING TO BE HELD WITH REPRESENTATIVE HOLT

ASME, in conjunction with AIChE, will host a Science, Engineering, and Technology Town Hall meeting with Congressman Rush Holt (D-NJ) on Tuesday, January 22, 2002, at the Ramada Inn in East Brunswick.  This forum will provide an opportunity to discuss with a member of Congress current public policy issues involving science, engineering, and technology.

Registration deadline is January 16, 2002.  Contact Patti Snyder at snyderp@asme.org for program and registration details.


DASCHLE ENDORSES DOUBLING OF CIVILIAN R&D

Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle called for doubling of civilian R&D funding and making the R&D tax credit permanent in a speech on the economy Friday.  Calling for a "balanced research portfolio," he noted that the National Institutes of Health "should not be the sole objective of U.S. science and technology policy."

His speech can be found at http://democrats.senate.gov/%7Edpc/releases/2002-1-4a.html
For more information, contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org. 



STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS

ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an annual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss technology-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technology-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opportunities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and technology entrepreneurs. 

The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.  For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/
If you have additional questions, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org.


OMB REPORT TARGETS LIST OF AGENCY REGULATIONS
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) recently published a report that lists federal regulations (including several environmental regulations like the new source review regulations under the Clean Air Act) it believes should be reviewed for possible changes.

The report also compares the cost and benefit of complying with health, safety, and environmental regulations, and proposals to improve the regulatory process.
For more information, please contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org. 


A DAY AT THE CAPITOL TO BE HELD IN CALIFORNIA

ASME's Region IX will host the 5th Annual Day at the Capitol in Sacramento, California on February 5.   The program will focus on three issues: energy, transportation, and engineering licensing.  Visits will also be scheduled for the participants with Chairman and Ranking Members of the appropriate committees of jurisdiction, as well as some individual visits with Assemblymen and Senators.  

For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric
Additional information is available from Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


DOT PROPOSES RULE TO REDUCE EFFECTS OF NATURAL GAS PIPELINE ACCIDENTS

On January 9 The Department of Transportation published the first portion of a proposed rule aimed at reducing the harmful effects of natural gas pipeline accidents. 

DOT's Research and Special Programs Administration (RSPA), published a note in the Federal Register, to define areas of high consequence where significant or considerable human or property harm would result from a gas transmission pipeline accident.

The proposal is addressing integrity management programs for natural gas pipelines with a two-part rule.  The majority of the rule should be published sometime later this year. Integrity management refers to the periodic inspection, testing, and repair of all pipeline segments that could affect high consequence areas. 

RSPA's philosophy toward gas pipelines builds on current class location regulations that require the operator to know what people would be affected by a pipeline rupture.  The agency's primary goal is to protect highly populated areas from a gas release.

Public comment on the proposed rule will be accepted until March 11, 2002.  For information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.


APPROPRIATIONS WRAP UP CONTINUED

Last week, R&D funding at the Department of Energy and NASA were detailed.  This month, the highlights of the FY2002 National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Department of Defense (DOD) budgets are summarized.


National Science Foundation

The NSF Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal Research and Development, provided testimony to the appropriate House and Senate Appropriations Subcommittees.  The testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-23.html
In addition, ASME joined 80 engineering, scientific and professional societies; corporations; and universities in asking Congress for a 15 percent increase in the NSF budget for FY 2002, which would continue the momentum toward doubling the agency's budget by 2006.  

In the end, Congress increased NSF's budget 8.4 percent ($373 million) to $4.8 billion, still significantly more than the 1.3 percent that had been requested by the Administration.  Of the total budget,  $3.6 billion will be allocated to the Research and Related Activities (RRA) budget line, an increase of 7.6 percent, or $256 million.  Within the RRA budget, engineering programs will receive $468 million (8.5 percent), a significant boost over the President's request of $431 million.


Department of Defense (DOD) 

For the second year in a row, the DOD Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D, delivered oral testimony before the House and Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-16.html

Basic Research and Applied Research, which provide a significant share of federal support for several key science and engineering disciplines, both received significant increases in funding.  Basic Research increased 5.5 percent to $1.389 billion, while Applied Research increased 12.5 percent ($459 million) to $4.135 billion.  The Advanced Technology Development line of the budget increased 11.4 percent ($457 million), for a total of $4.456 billion.


National Institute of Standards and Technology

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Task Force, of ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D, provided written testimony on the Fiscal Year (FY) 2002 appropriation to the appropriate House and Senate Appropriation Subcommittees.  Copies of the testimony can be found at: http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-10.html 

The Advanced Technology program, which provides matching grants to corporations to fund high-risk research, was increased 26.9 percent ($39.1 million), for a total of $184.5 million in new funds.  Combined with carryover funds from last fiscal year, the program will have $217.6 million in fiscal year 2002.

While the administration had attempted to suspend the ATP program unsuccessfully, it requested a significant increase (11.3 percent) for the Scientific and Technical Research and Services (STRS) budget, which funds the NIST in-house laboratories and the Baldridge National Quality program.  In the final bill, Congress provided only a 2.9 percent ($9.2 million) increase for this budget, for a total of $321.1 million.

3.4=09Risk Measurement for Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk focuses on whether the Company is able to raise enou=
gh capital (whether through debt, equity, or counterparty collateral) to me=
et its cash and collateral requirements, and is a function of funding liqui=
dity and position liquidity.  Margin deposits received and margin deposits =
required under the Company's Trading Portfolio have a significant impact on=
 the Company's funding requirements, and are often determined by changes in=
 commodity prices.  Position liquidity refers to the extent to which a posi=
tion can be liquidated quickly, and in large volume, without substantially =
affecting the position's price.  Key determinants of the liquidity of a pos=
ition and the cost of liquidation include: (a) the level of third-party int=
erest and market activity in the asset, (b) the time period available to co=
nvert the asset to cash, (c) the size (value or volumes) of the asset, and =
(d) perception of the Company in the marketplace.  Active management of fun=
ding requirements and capital availability should minimize funding shortfal=
ls.  See Section 4.4 for the limit structure and reporting guidelines.
The Liquidity Exposure Ratio ("Liquidity Ratio") is the primary metric of t=
he Company's liquidity/funding risk to be implemented under a transition pe=
riod determined by the Risk Management Committee.  The Liquidity Ratio shal=
l be calculated daily over a specified time period by dividing (a) the sum =
of the Company's (i) Future Available Cash and (ii) Borrowing Capacity, by =
(b) the Company's Potential Future Cash Requirements.  Future Available Cas=
h shall represent the Company's current cash-flow forecast as determined by=
 the Accounting department, considering operating and investing activities.=
  Borrowing Capacity shall be determined by the Treasury department, and sh=
all be calculated as the sum of: (a) commercial paper; (b) uncommitted bank=
 lines and loan sales lines; (c) letter of credit facilities; (d) accounts =
receivable; (e) shelf registrations for public debt issues; and (f) shelf r=
egistrations for public equity issues.  Potential Future Cash Requirements =
shall be calculated by the Trading Portfolio's risk systems and shall repre=
sent a simulation of margin exposure and collateral requirements for the Tr=
ading Portfolio.
Liquidity stress testing shall be performed periodically, as determined by =
the Chief Risk Officer, to quantify the liquidity/funding risks associated =
with specific positions.  Such stress testing may include specific asset li=
quidity stress tests to quantify the risks associated with illiquid positio=
ns.  Results of liquidity stress testing will be made available to the CEO =
and to other parties at the discretion of the Chief Risk Officer.

4.4=09Capital Associated with Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk arises from the potential that funding requirements =
will exceed funding availability for a given time period.  Funding requirem=
ents may vary over time as a result of: (a) exchange margin requirements, c=
ollateral obligations and collateral receivables primarily related to Tradi=
ng Portfolio activities; (b) new investments; (c) the payment of interest a=
nd dividends; and (d) the maturing of debt and other obligations.  Funding =
availability may vary over time as a result of: (a) available cash; (b) acc=
ess to capital markets; (c) available collateral; and (d) the time required=
 to convert positions to cash or liquid assets.
The Company shall use the Liquidity Ratio, liquidity stress testing and oth=
er methods as specified by the Chief Risk Officer to measure liquidity/fund=
ing risk.
4.4.1=09Limit Structure for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The CEO shall approve an advisory limit for liquidity/funding risk ("Liquid=
ity Ratio Advisory") to be implemented under a transition period approved b=
y the Risk Management Committee.  This shall be based on the Liquidity Rati=
o discussed in Section 3.4 of this Policy.  The Liquidity Ratio shall be ca=
lculated using two different assumptions to calculate Potential Future Cash=
 Requirements, the denominator of the calculation: (a) a 50% confidence lev=
el, and (b) a 99% confidence level.
4.4.2=09Administration/Reporting for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The Liquidity Ratio shall be calculated on a daily basis and reported by GR=
MO to the CEO, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Treasury department designee=
.  If the Liquidity Ratio is (a) less than 3.0 using a 50% confidence level=
 to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements or (b) less than 1.5 using=
 a 99% confidence level to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements, th=
e Chief Risk Officer shall notify the CEO and others at his discretion.  Th=
e CEO shall direct senior management to take certain actions to mitigate th=
e Company's liquidity/funding risk.

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow "form of agreement".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.

The $95MM profit in Power-Canada on Friday turned out to be release of reserves as well, so total reserve release was $803 MM (vs. the $700 we knew of in Frevert meeting).

$500 Gas
$208 EES
$ 95  Canada Power

5-day P/L $563, so $240 5-day 5-day loss w/o reserve release.

QTD P/L $775, so $28 QTD profit w/o reserve release. 


The $500 Gas & $95 Power reserve releases leaves ~$750 MM in North America's Schedule C & D, although most of that is specific deal reserves.

Well, it looks like we have the commitment and scope necessary to improve the accuracy of the daily risk information.  Hopefully, GRMO will now focus on the overall validity of the data and not continue to count the failures without understanding the impact.  Would like to bring you up to date.  I will try to get on your calendar or just stop by your office.  
 
Welcome back.

Subject: RE: Reconciliation Across Risk Applications



Rick and Greg: 

Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she, Beth Apollo and I discussed recently.  

Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.  

In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.  

Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.  

We are creating a steering committee and project management office for this project with operations, RAC and IT members that will be appropriate, but not too large.  We want to focus on getting the work done.  I will gladly update all on this distribution list in the next 10 days on  our finalized steering committee, project managers, definition of outcomes from the project and planned completion dates.  We look forward to the opportunity to solve this data discrepancy issue in a definitive way.  --Sally

Subject:        Reconciliation Across Risk Applications 


Rick and Greg, 

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 

source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  

    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available: 

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?) 

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows 

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed. 

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

I hope you had a good holiday, in spite of all the machinations going on.

I just finished an amazing book called "When Genius Failed: The Rise and
Fall of Long-Term Capital Management".  If you haven't read it, you should.

I'm almost afraid to ask when you might have a slot open for lunch... any
ideas?

Jim

Lets get together and figure out how we get our arms around what is left of=
 the estate, as it relates to capture, reporting, VaR, credit etc.

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

Pls. plan to join the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting scheduled for Friday, November 2, at 3:30 p.m., CST.  For planning purposes, your placement on the agenda is as follows:
Jeff McMahon		#1
Rick Buy			#2
Mark Haedicke+Others 	#7

It makes sense for Jeff and Rick to be there at 3:30.  We will call Mark at his office a few minutes before his session and the rest of his team will join via teleconference at that time.  

Please call me or Kelly Johnson (36485) if you have any questions.  

Thanks.

Paula,  Tim Detmering talked with Jeff McMahon about this the other night, but Tim isn't in today so I don't know what they decided.  However, in October it was decided by Rick Buy and Pug Winokur that this was not a board action item.  I know a lot has changed since then, so if we want to take this to the board this time we will prepare the information as you suggest.  Would you re-check with Jeff McMahon and Rick Buy and confirm that this will be a board agenda item.  In the interim, Steve Harper will get the listed items in a package.

Jeff

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow "form of agreement".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

As things begin to calm down somewhat after events of last week, we wanted to update all employees of certain organizational and personnel changes that have occurred recently.

Organizational Matters
The Creditors' Committee was formed last week by the United States Trustee.  This committee is comprised of 15 individuals representing various creditor groups including: banks, bondholders, insurance companies and employees.  The Creditors' Committee will be the key point of contact as we reorganize the company and emerge from Chapter 11.  Initially, they will send financial advisors to our offices to monitor any asset liquidations as well as review our cash flow projections.  Ultimately, they will be responsible for approving our reorganization plan as to which assets or businesses we sell and which ones we retain.

>From an Enron perspective, the plans for reorganization have already begun.  Overhead has been reduced dramatically, certain employee retention programs have been put in place and a wider retention program is currently being developed.  We hope to share the wider retention program with you in the very near future.  Furthermore, detail cash flow projections are in their final stages of preparation and will be reviewed by senior management this week.  This will be the critical first step in formulating our reorganization strategy to emerge from Chapter 11 as a healthy company.

By now, you must have heard of "NETCO." This company was formed as a means to maximize the value of Enron's most valuable business, the wholesale energy business.  Certain Enron North America employees have been assigned to NETCO to re-build the North American gas and power business under different ownership.  We will be filing with the bankruptcy court this week proposed auction procedures to allow bidders to bid for NETCO.  It is our expectation that Enron would retain a 49 percent (or perhaps less) non-controlling interest in NETCO.  The NETCO employees would become employees of the winning bidder.  We anticipate this process to reach closure sometime in January.

As for the remaining businesses of Enron, they are all under review as to which ones will be proposed for sale and which ones will be proposed for retention.  This review process will take time as it will require approval of the Creditors' Committee.  We will update you periodically on our process.

Personnel Matters
As a result of our current situation, we have made many personnel changes over the past several months to maximize the value of the organization.

Office of the Chairman - Enron Corp
Jeff McMahon, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, has been added to the Office of the Chairman of Enron Corp along with Ken Lay and Greg Whalley.  Among other things, Jeff has been working on the business plan for reorganization in Chapter 11 and is the primary contact with the newly formed Creditor's Committee.

Treasurer - Enron Corp
Ray Bowen was elected to Executive Vice President, Finance and Treasurer of Enron Corp recently.  In this role, Ray is responsible for all finance activities of Enron Corp.  Ray also has the lead role in managing the cash activities of the company on a day to day basis.

Corporate Development
Mark Muller has been appointed Executive Vice President - Corporate Development.  In this role, Mark will work with Enron's various business units on all asset disposals, which will be a key element in Enron's reorganization plan and value preservation.

Wholesale Services
The Wholesale Services group has been reorganized under the leadership of Jim Fallon.  Included in this group are the following businesses, ENA, EBS, EIM and EGM.  As part of the Chapter 11 reorganization, efforts in these businesses will be directed at maximizing value for the creditors as well as determining which businesses or assets will be part of Enron's reorganization plan.

Management Committee Departures
Unfortunately, due to the current financial condition of the company, the following members of the management committee have left the company or will be leaving the company by the end of December:

Michael Brown
Mark Frevert
Steve Kean
Mike McConnell
Jeff Shankman

Additionally, John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen have resigned from the Management Committee to arrange for the joint venture energy activities of NETCO.

We know as employees the uncertainty surrounding the future of the company is unsettling.  Unfortunately, that aspect will not change in the near term.  We ask for everyone's patience and continued support as we move forward through the Chapter 11 process.  We are committed to reorganizing into a strong company once again and will need the help of all the employees to achieve that goal.

Rick,

Olivier's request for clarification is consistent with what we have discussed in the past (although constrained, but pre-approved, limits for "yellow" countries [shown in black in the attached] probably make sense), but I want to ensure that you continue to concur with this approach based upon our most recent list of green/yellow/red countries.  Please let me know if you have any comments regarding this issue.

Regards,

Dave

David, Ted:

As you are aware, we are increasingly being asked by traders/originators to clarify our views on doing business in sub-investment grade countries.  Recent quieries have focused particularly on power deals in the Balkans (Bosnia, Macedonia, etc.) and metal deals in countries ranging from Uzbekistan to Vietnam.  In order to give them the kind of guidelines they need, I would like to be able to use the recently prepared table of conforming/not recommended/non conforming countries. My proposal would be to essentially tell them that:

(1) No business can be done in a non-conforming country unless explicitly authorized by the ENE Office of the Chairman. 

(2) No business can be done in a not-recommended country unless explicitly authorized by RAC.

(3) Both authorizations should be based on: 

	(i) a country assessment by RAC and other relevant teams (Legal for example); 

	(ii) an explanation by the traders/originators of the strategic importance of doing business there and of their future plans (expected type of business and
	 volume); and 

	(iii) a list of requirements prepared by RAC setting out:

	- the type of business that we think we could do in that country; 
	- the extent of due diligence required before closing deals (background checks, legal opinion, etc.); 
	- the required mitigants (insurance, etc.); and, possibly
	- a maximum aggregate exposure to the country. 

(4) The country approval would obviously not replace the normal RAC requirements on specific deals.

I would be grateful if you could please let me have your comments on this.  If this is something you can live with, we will need to make sure that: (i) the list is finalized asap; (ii) we get a clear picture of what our current country exposure is (I have already asked metals to provide this to us); and (iii) we communicate all this to the teams.    

Regards.

Olivier

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	BNP Paribas Master Netting Agreement

	We are moving ahead with finalizing a Master Netting Agreement that will cover all physical and financial agreements between BNP Paribas and Enron, except for the exchange agreements pertaining to NYMEX and LME trading.

Rick and Greg:

Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she, Beth Apollo and I discussed recently.  

Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.  

In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.  

Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.  

We are creating a steering committee and project management office for this project with operations, RAC and IT members that will be appropriate, but not too large.  We want to focus on getting the work done.  I will gladly update all on this distribution list in the next 10 days on  our finalized steering committee, project managers, definition of outcomes from the project and planned completion dates.  We look forward to the opportunity to solve this data discrepancy issue in a definitive way.  --Sally

Subject:	Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

German Bank Bets on Predictive Analytics


From: Bank Technology News
Aug 28, 2001
By Louise West
		


German investment bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein (DrKW) has purchased
analytic software that, it hopes, will put it on the cutting edge of risk
management. 

WhiteLight Systems, the Palo Alto, CA-based company, has announced that the
investment bank selected analytics and Web reporting software for a global
risk management solution in a licences and services contract valued at $2.3
million. 

The bank is using WhiteLight to develop applications that will help control
the bank's exposure to risk. DrKW hopes the applications will improve the
visibility of data about its investment banking portfolio, such as foreign
exchange, equities and derivatives, to a much wider range of business
decision makers across the global business and provide a more flexible
system for interrogating the data. The bank also expects the new
applications to uncover new product and market opportunities. 

The initial project involves developing three applications: credit risk,
market risk and product control. Based on WhiteLight's AnalyticServer, DrKW
will roll out the applications in 2001 across its major international
trading centers, including Frankfurt, London, New York and Tokyo.
AnalyticServer's multi-dimensional modeling engine is at the core of
WhiteLight's application suite. It is designed to allow complex interactive
analysis within large and varying data sources. 

Additionally, DrKW has selected iApplicationServer, WhiteLight's solution
for Web-based analytics, to enable DrKW's decision makers worldwide to
operate from a unified global view of business data. Using
iApplicationServer, the German bank will be able to create and deploy
interactive reports to any user on the Web. 

The bank is not talking about its purchase, but Peter Beard, WhiteLight's
vice president of world wide sales, could confirm that DrKW is our biggest
physical user in the world. It has 25 WhiteLight servers in production, and
it has purchased the largest number of our servers within our customer base,
in the shortest amount of time. Other project areas within the bank are
looking at how to use WhiteLight. 

Other European banks are considering buying the technology, developed as the
next step up from online analytical processing (OLAP), which is regarded as
increasingly unwieldy and inflexible in the wake of the e-business
revolution. Merrill Lynch predicts that the total e- business analytics
market opportunity will top $25.1 billion by 2004. 

Growing market 

It's a fact that the scope of business is ever expanding, from the size of
an institution's operations to the markets and customers it can reach. At
the same time, market conditions and customer requirements change rapidly,
and there are more factors and variables to be considered before decisions
can be made, WhiteLight says. 

Gartner analysts agree and they predict significant growth in the predictive
analytics business. By 2005, enterprises will need three times as many
professionals on their analytic staff as they need today, Gartner believes,
and the demand for analytic talent today outweighs supply by at least two to
one. The killer trend for e-business will likely be the real-time
enterprise, i.e. an enterprise able to collect nearly instantaneous feedback
on business processes and to take the right adaptive, corrective or
preventative action. Web analytics enables executives and managers to know
where the company stands in its quest to become a real-time enterprise and
when the company will achieve real-time business capability across all
channels, from the shop floor to the e-marketplace says Gartner. 

Accordingly, a new generation of analytic applications, dubbed predictive
analytics, is needed to help managers understand what is happening and why,
and to test the outcome of prospective decisions. 

WhiteLight's Analytic Application Suite has been developed to allow the
near-instant extraction of critical and previously unavailable
decision-support information from large and complex databases, the company
says. 

It is still very new and can be categorized as an early adopter market, says
Beard of the technology. People are looking at two scenarios. There are
those companies that want to be leading edge, or those which have used
traditional methods (of risk management) and found their limits. With
operational risk, the only way to do anything remotely like we do is with
Excel, and it results in the 25-page spreadsheet from hell which only one or
two people in the company can understand. We can put the data on a server
rather than a desktop and all users are permitted to see all facets.
Business managers or analysts don't need to know SQL to create
multi-dimensional models. They can define formulas and data sources using a
drag and drop interface. 

According to Beard, All the products that have grown up over the last 10
years have been what I call rearview mirror technology. It's historical
data, looking at where you have come from. Predictive analytics takes the
same data, but in increasingly large volumes and puts it into a model so
that analysts can interact with that. What if, for example, there were to be
a change in the underlying rate by 10 basis points? You can make the change
and see the impact across the entire model. 

Growing interest 

Although the impact of predictive analytics on DrKW's bottom line is not yet
known, WhiteLight says that one of its clients involved in loan
collateralization believes it will be able to return $20 million to the
balance sheet thanks to the software. Financial institutions will also be
able to hang onto costly legacy systems, says Beard. Every bank has legacy
systems on which they have spent millions. We sit above that in a platform.
Pertinent data is modeled within the WhiteLight server. 

Other financial institutions in Europe are keen to follow in DrKW's
footsteps, says Beard, who already counts Barclays, J.P. Morgan Chase and
Lehman Brothers among his company's customers. We are involved in a major
project with a large multi-national Dutch bank with the same profile as
DrKW. It is an existing customer with whom we will be putting the technology
group wide. It owns a number of other banks across Germany and Holland. And
over the next month we will be able to announce three new contracts in
Switzerland, Germany and Holland. 

The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) has created a groundswell of
interest in predictive analytic applications with its new Basel Capital
Accord. The accord is based on three pillars that allow banks to evaluate
properly the various risks they face. It focuses on minimum capital
requirements, the supervisory review of an institution's capital adequacy
and market discipline through effective disclosure to encourage safe and
sound banking practices, according to the BIS. The new accord will be
finalized at the end of the year, and is expected to be implemented in
member jurisdictions by 2004. 

It will be a real benefit to banks if they can reduce the amount of
provision they must have. It is a clearly defined initiative with massive
tangible benefits, says Beard.

Gentlemen:

	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance
Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics
(and any others which occur to you):

1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified
therein) established;

2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;

3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the
wholesale gas and electricity business.

	It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of
recent investments and perhaps on the larger "asset" investments such as
Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.  Even as we move away from these investments,
there may be some additional lessons to be learned.  Does our post-audit
process and procedure continue?

	We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the
proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

	Best regards.

You are in the New York Times today, page C6.  Can't tell if it's good or bad cuz I don't understand business jargon.  I'm about to go for a little run.  It's beautiful out.  Met a new professor today, Russian but nice.  Ready for summer vacation already!  At least we have a three day weekend.  Hope you're having a good day.

Cheers,
Jules

Rick,
Let me know if you would like to get together to discuss how the Raptor unwind is accomplished from a mechanical standpoint, as well as, what comes back to Enron in the transaction.  I would happy to sit down and walk you through it.  Just let me know when might work for you to get together.  Thanks Rick,
Ron Baker

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

Rick - 

As we discussed, I have an outstanding tax liability with the Australian government, and I need your help in this matter.  Working for Enron Ex-Pat Services, I incurred additional tax liabilities which Enron was to pay on my behalf.  In simple terms, Enron agreed to make up the difference between my U.S. income tax liability and that charged by Australia.  My full U.S. tax liability was withheld from my paychecks and Enron was to make up the difference between this and the 48% charged by the Australian government.  

As of today, the incremental tax liability has not been addressed by Enron, and I need to resolve this issue immediately.  It appears that the easiest solution is for Enron Corp. to wire Enron Australia the estimated tax liability, with Enron Australia passing the money to the Australian tax authority. I will have the final estimate from PWC first thing Monday morning, but it has been indicated that the liability in total will be less than $50,000 U.S..

I appreciate any help you can provide in getting this matter resolved.  I will provide you the specific estimates Monday morning, and in the interim, if there is anything else you need from me, I am at your disposal.


Thanks - 

John Suttle

I just returned from a meeting and had a voice mail from Marc Manly (NPW General Counsel) indicating they had a good meeting with Gene Lockhart this morning and were in the process of turning the document around.  The voice mail was left at 11:35 am this morning.  Marc indicated he would try to E-Mail the documents (blacklined to show changes) to us in approximately 1 hour and suggested that after we skim the documents we get on a short conference call with him so he could walk us through NPW's thought process on why they made the changes (and not to negotiate the document on this call).  Marc indicated, for example, that they changed the daily requirement for reporting in Section 2(b) because from a practical perspective NPW could not meet this schedule.  He also indicated that much of their review had been focused on making sure from a practical perspective the documents worked.

I will keep you advised.
Robert

Communicating Across Differences - October 10, 2001 
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
8:00 am - 12:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course focuses on using the world's most powerful personality profile, the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) to learn to communicate and work with people whose personalities and communication styles are different from your own.  It begins from the foundation of understanding your own personality and communication approach, then moves to applying that knowledge to improve communication with others.  One of the additional tools used in this course is the "MBTI Work Styles"-which explores in detail how personality differences affect people's approach to work and communication.

The program is highly interactive, with exercises and activities that enable participants to truly experience how human personality impacts people's communication, priorities, decision-making, and work style.  It is also highly practical, focusing on maximizing successful business outcomes through effective communication.



Achieving Results Through Coaching - October 10, 2001
DoubleTree Hotel - DeZavala
1:00 pm - 5:00 pm          Cost:  $350

This course uses a classic competency model, as well as a powerful assessment of interpersonal communication style, called the FIRO-B, as a foundation for coaching.  It teaches the coach to think himself or herself back through their own learning stages in order to coach others effectively.  It also teaches participants to recognize the different stages where the various people they coach might be and adapt their coaching style as employees move from stage to stage.  It also helps participants understand their own interpersonal communication style, through the FIRO-B, and learn to leverage it for greatest effectiveness as a coach.

Participants will create coaching action plans for use with employees.

Rick:  As a follow up to our discussion on headcount reduction, as you know, there are several important fiduciary functions that the Portfolio group performs related to the existing asset portfolio that should be performed until the assets are sold:

Review and audit of contractually required fundings for capital and operating expenditures (we usually recover $$$))
Maintenance of compliance system to ensure compliance with reporting requirements and transaction covenants
Maintenance of the PortRAC system that is used for asset management, data rooms and Board reporting
Post transaction reviews as directed by Management and the Board

In addition to our obligation to management and shareholders, JEDI II and CalPERS look to RAC to make sure that the Commercial Teams are maximizing value.

In my opinion, some staff should be maintained to perform these functions or value and the ability to sell these assets will be compromised.

I am available to discuss at your convenience.

Louise- Any notion of amount of risk bidders are comfy with, both credit and market? I doubt anything specific has been discussed but have any ranges been thrown out. Hope all is well. Happy New Year. Rick

Subject: FW: Re-start/Integration Planning



Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks 

Louise

Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

Hey Dad.  I know you're tied up in meetings, and I know you are probably very bored and anxious.  But I just wanted to let you know that at times like this I realize how AWESOME you are.  I'm sure you have tons of stuff on your mind, as today has definitely not been one of the better ones for our family.  But that which does not kill us makes us stronger, and God knows we will be stronger after this.  This will all be over soon and we will be able to look back and laugh (as I will also by then have figured out how to get my computer to stop running in safe mode and actually be able to read the e-mails I am typing.)  A pretty smart guy once told me that when things like this happen, they always seem huge at the time.  But in the timeline of your life [        timeline        ] this whole experience will encompass like one/one thousandth of the period at the end of this sentence.  I miss you and wish I could be there for this whole ordeal.  But please try to keep your chin up !
and your good spirit, because I'm 
pretty sure that's all that matters in the end.  I love you loads and wish you the best of everything.

Cheers big ears,
Jules

P.S.  I'm gonna send you a joke after I send this one.  Don't read it if it's not an opportune time for you to laugh out loud.

Ron and Scott

I have instructed Deal Capture to leave Gigi's on the books.  I intended to catch up to you on this issue.  My group got zealous and asked for the unwind.  We should handle upfront in our processs.

Please find attached the list of clients which I suggest not to contract with in the future.   Enron may not want to be associated with adult entertainment, XXX video, nude tannig salons etc.  Basically, the number of deals is insignificant.

If agreed, can you instruct the Agents not to target such clients?

 

Regards
Molly

Subject:	Re: TX Mass Market 9/26/01

I spoke with Erich.  We have 4 or 5 customers to date with names suggesting these types of businesses.  The number of customers is trivial, so if we were to put in place a policy saying we won't do these deals it will have no real effect on business performance.

I will discuss with Molly and Jim and we will decide what to do.  We will then put the policy in place so that, should we choose not to accept these customers, (1) the rejection rights listed in the contract will reflect this, and (2) we will catch them before we book the deal, eliminating any unwind risk.

Ron

FYI. Please forward to others who need this info. 

As the market expected, the judge issued what arguably is a worst case scenario.  Recall that this is a judge's recommendation (working with Kommissioner Karl Wood).  The full commission will vote on it and two other commissioners will have to agree wtih Karl for the recommendation to stick (i.e., it takes 3 votes).

Somewhat surprising, the Commission is giving folks till February 1 to comment and have scheduled  the decision for a vote on February 7th.  I assume that the market will object fairly strongly to this schedule.

We'll be checking with other market participants to see how folks intend to attack the decision. If you have questions, let me know.

Best,
Jeff

Subject: Draft Decision on Retroactive Suspension of Direct Access


On January 25, 2002, ALJ Barnett issued a draft decision establishing a
retroactive suspension date for direct access, and strictly limiting the
provisions in contracts executed prior to the suspension date.
Specifically, the draft order provides the following:

1. DA contracts executed after June 30, 2001 are suspended until DWR no
longer supplies power under AB 1X.

2.  DA contracts executed prior to July 1, 2001 "pursuant to which
electricity flowed prior to July 1, 2001", are not suspended, but are
subject to certain restrictions.

3. The following are the restrictions placed on direct access contracts
executed prior to July 1, 2001:

	a. No customer is allowed to switch from one ESP to another after
June 30, 2001.  

	b.  No customer is allowed to add a new location to its direct
access contract after June 30, 2001.

	c. No direct access contract may be extended beyond its initial
termination date as fixed prior to July 1, 2001.

	d.  Direct access contracts may not be assigned after June 30, 2001.

	e.  A  customer who had direct access prior to July 1, 2001, but who
became a bundled customer cannot return to direct 	access after June
30, 2001.  


The UDCs are given ninety days from the date of the order to terminate all
direct access contracts not in conformity with the order and return those
customers to bundled service.

Comments on the draft decision must be filed by February 1 (no reply
comments allowed). The Commission will vote on the decision at its February
7th meeting.

If you have any questions, please contact me.

Jeanne Bennett

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

EES Europe Clinches Long-Term Outsourcing Deal With Guinness
EES Europe has signed a 15-year agreement to own and operate energy assets =
at the Park Royal Guinness Brewery in London. The deal means EES will sourc=
e gas and electricity to provide steam, compressed air, chilled water and o=
ther industrial commodities to one of the largest breweries in Europe. EES =
will also have responsibility for managing a series of energy reduction mea=
sures at the plant, designed to improve performance and reduce costs. These=
 measures will include investment in new boiler, refrigeration, compressed =
air and effluent treatment plant.

Stuart Rexrode, Vice President of EES Europe, said: "Closing this deal was =
an outstanding effort by the entire team and is another example of the type=
 of innovative energy partnerships we are forming in the marketplace. This =
transaction, coupled with the Sainsbury's deal, has caused the industry to =
start taking notice of EES, and I am confident more customers will be knock=
ing on our door looking for similar structures."

Congratulations to everyone on the team for their dedication!

Enron signs first long-term dry bulk shipping freight origination deal with=
 major Japanese player
Enron's shipping freight team has signed a 10-year time charter deal for a =
178,000 tonne capesize vessel with Lepta Shipping (with a performance guara=
ntee from Mitsui & Co Ltd, Tokyo, Japan)   The agreement has a notional val=
ue of USD60 million and a mark-to-market value of USD 5 million.  The new a=
greement gives Enron the option to buy the vessel in Japanese yen after the=
 third year and the time charter period itself can be extended by us by up =
to an additional four years, if required.  The agreement takes effect from =
the latter part of 2003 when the ship itself, currently being manufactured =
in the Imabari shipyard in Japan or any similar substitute vessel, becomes =
available.  "We are already in the process of onselling the first three yea=
rs of our time charter above the curve ," announces Pierre Aury, who heads =
up Enron's dry bulk freight team.  "This deal gives us a strategic long "da=
ys" position and we now expect to close further deals as a result of our dr=
ive to commoditise more time charter transactions."  The team is already ex=
ploring new time charter deals in the scarcer cape-size and handy-size vess=
el market.  A combined effort between the legal, tax, credit, transport sup=
port and structuring teams was instrumental in helping to book this deal ju=
st in time for Q2.  The shipping freight team is already working on a new s=
tructured deal with a major UK bank, so watch this space for future announc=
ements...

Enron Credit Closes Deal with Enron's Shipping Desk
On 8 August, 2001 Enron's shipping desk bought a Digital  Bankruptcy Swap (=
DBS) from Enron Credit in order to buy protection against a Japanese indust=
rial/trading counterparty.  Under the terms of the deal the shipping desk w=
ill receive pay-out from Enron Credit when this counterparty becomes insolv=
ent under Japanese laws and therefore hedges the counterparty risk that  th=
e desk holds when transacting with this Japanese counterparty.  When the le=
vel of the shipping desk's mark to market profit rises above a certain amou=
nt, the desk will also have the ability to buy additional DBS protection.  =
Similarly, if the desk's contract with the Japanese counterparty terminates=
 earlier, the desk can sell back any unused DBS cover to Enron Credit.

"We needed to increase our credit capacity with this counterparty in order =
to do more deals and then realised that Enron Credit could help us," said P=
ierre Aury who heads up the freight team. "Another driver was that we felt =
we needed to set a foot in the DBS market in order to go up the learning cu=
rve and develop shipping specific DBSs for the near future." "The hedge bet=
ween these two commercial groups is another milestone in Enron's internal r=
isk management.  With each commercial group having to optimise its capital =
at risk, the services and tools Enron Credit has on offer are an excellent =
complement to our already sophisticated RAC process," commented Ted Murphy,=
 Head of RAC in Europe.

Congratulations go to Andrew Feachem who originated the deal for Enron Cred=
it and Pierre Aury.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay

The KOMP Horticultural contract for the maintenance of leased floor plants has been cancelled.  Plant maintenance is not being performed on the leased plants in the Enron Building on floors 3 through 49.  Rather than removing the plants from the building, KOMP Horticultural has chosen to offer the plants to Enron employees for sale.  On January 16th from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, KOMP will have a table on the south side of the plaza, by the up escalator, for those employees interested in purchasing a plant. At the time of purchase, KOMP will give a special sticker to place on the container of the sold plant (do not bring plants to the plaza for purchase).  Plants will not be allowed to be removed from the building unless they have the KOMP sold sticker on the container.

The following guidelines must be followed:
?	Plants will be priced at $30 plus tax for floor plants; $10 plus tax for desk-top plants.
?	Only potted plants in black plastic containers are for sale.  Plants in chrome, bronze, clay or any other outside containers are not for sale. 
?	Employees must remove all plants from the building themselves.  Building Services cannot make pick-ups or deliveries.  
?	Security will be inspecting plants to assure they have the appropriate sticker when they are removed from the premises. 
?	Payment must be in cash or a personal check made out to KOMP Horticultural.    

If you have any questions please contact Richard Hensch at ext. 35522.

We now have a structure in place dealing with Enron Americas estate and ensuring that we best maximize all of our contractual and asset positions.  This team will be headed by Don Miller going forward please help him and the team as this is our highest priority.

Some areas of this organization remain blank and will be completed by Don and the head of the appropriate business unit.  There are some areas which will also be dual tasking for a period.

Rick:  Good list.  As a subset of Bankruptcy Group we may want to add our efforts to foster development of consistent, accurate, Enron-wide accounts receivable aging information (Carson, Curry, Bradford).  Also, our approved 2002 budget, while allowing some limited headcount growth, may present challenges with everything on our plate.  We could discuss some potentially creative ways to lever our budget dollars.  Rick C.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.

The doorstep audit is not yet complete as I'm having about 25 or so deals "tested" out of the Long Beach office. We should know all final results within the next week or so. Rick-your suggestions are generally on target as we have already begun the process for pulling each specific office's information together-ie: how many offices do we have, who are the specific people in them, what do they transact on (DSM, gas/power commodity, services mgmt., etc), and can we consolidate/minimize the number of offices we have.  For example, of the 87-ish offices that we currently have EES folks in, only 14 of those offices have individuals that transact gas or power deals in the EnronDirect sales group (ie:  customers below $10 million in energy spend) and there are @ 45 sales folks in these 14 offices. 

The losses now expected out of the Long Beach office are MUCH lower than initial estimates. If anyone would like to review, please call me directly.

We are already well underway in establishing new transaction process' for both gas and power deals. Although we have already put in place and communicated these new procedures to each of the sales offices, we are putting together a "sales package" that will encompass each of the new procedures in detail, each of the new gas and power contracts and rules for use, and a new sales policy which will review in detail the responsibilities for each sales individual. This policy will require signatures from the sales folks in order for them to continue working for EES in a sales transaction role. We are also exploring an independent verification process whereby we would have someone from either Deal Capture or Deal Management actually contact the customer to confirm the transaction. The "McDonald's Hamburger" analogy is quite appropriate here!


Just wanted to let everyone know what was already underway.

I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.

Good job on handling the "5's".

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	Remote Offices- Suggestions

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick

Hi Rick,

Chris Abel mentioned to me at the beginning of the quarter that I (none of us) had to sign off on the DPR, and that our viewing it alone was sufficient.  I see, though, there still is the sign off button on the bottom of the report.  Is viewing it enough?

Jeff

Everyone, 

Once again, there are a number of new viruses that have been released on the internet that are causing us to do frequent updates to our virus protection software.  

We have an automated process to update our workstations with the latest virus protection updates.   However, there may be some machines that didn't get the update.  In order to prevent these viruses from infecting your machine, please assist by doing one of the following tasks. 

1.  Logout of the network and log back in or
2.  Click on START>PROGRAMS>ACCESSORIES>Norton AntiVirus Corporate Edition and then click the Live Update button.  This will pop up a screen where you will have to click the "Next" button and then a "Finish" button.   (If you are an EES user, you will only be able to use option #1 as you use a different virus protection product.)     

The proper version of the update pattern you need is:   (9/24/2001, version 30924p)

If you have questions or concerns, please direct them to your Resolution Center.

Enron Global Technology

I called the number for Bill Cronin and got voice mail for Raquel.    Have you heard from Bill?  We are STILL futzing with the docs.  Baker & Botts has not staffed this properly on the transaction side.

Works for me in concept....I will check with Port in the AM regarding the most efficient and effective price proxy for valuation of inventory.  I think there are a lot of locations which may trade at premiums to Nymex in their storage positions.

Attached is a draft of the NewPower DASH.  The maximum amount available against AR and Inventory may adjust slightly based on projected eligible accounts receivable versus ineligble.   We also need to coordinate the legal risk memo.

As previously stated, this meeting will be for Enron's bank relationship and credit officers only.   As such, identification will be checked at the door. If you have not already returned your institution's Confidentiality Agreement, please fax it back to Mary Border's attention at 713.646.3422 by noon, Friday, November 16th.

Bill and Friends:
FYI,
things are still quite tight here.  signed a number of netting agreements and some collateral as well towards the end of last week.
Fri nite signed 'ring-type' trade with Innogy which is one reason they came out in press saying that they were trading with us.
Also, signed netting and all but one point on collateral agreement with JAron.

Downgrade to Baa3/BBB- increases margin requirments by about ?19mm - primarily credit trading (solution to this being worked on but not imminent)

Priorities are producers of gas and power in UK.
In particular global counterparties.
cna you please provide brief update of following from your side for our 7:30 am meeting tomorrow (any quick insight/status appreciated)
Hess
Duke
AEP
EKT


Also, any news of status of secured bank facility, L/C capacity, when do we expect wire from Dynegy, S&P had ugly headlines(comments?)

We are starting to get some noise from regulators (FSA, OFGEN) and exchanges (UK px, lpx and apx) -not big numbers but hasssle and bad optics

Your bretheren here are stressing a little so any sympathy/empathy/encouragement/good news you can throw to Pat/Minna/Rod/Christine would be good

Of course, the only thing that keeps us from whining to you guys is that you have it about 10x worse - trust me we appreciate how hard you are all working.  We will remember you in the afterlife.

Thanks

Ted and acquantances

Rick:  Lynn and I have completed personal demos of PortRAC for the following executives:

				Mark Frevert
				Louise Kitchen
				Mike McConnell	
				Jeff Shankman
				Ray Bowen
				Jim Hughes
				Kevin Garland
				Jeff Donahue

We attempted to schedule but had declines from the following people:  Greg Whalley, Jeff McMahon, Jim Fallon, John Lavorato.  Andy Fastow has expressed an interest in seeing the demo and we are getting on his calendar.  Once we get enough EES info to be meaningful we will attempt to schedule Delainey and Dietrich and now that Horton has Global Assets we will try to schedule him.  Olivier and Ted have been helping publicize the sytem in the London office and we have had several requests for access from London.

The response from those execs that have seen the demo is very favorable!  They think that it is a great tool.  

All have expressed a concern about who can access the data and we have completed a security enhancement that allows us to "firewall" PortRAC by business unit.  We are working with each business unit to get a list of their approved users. 

Please let me know if you have anyone else for which you would like to demo PortRAC. 						
								
Rick C.

After discussions with the management team, the HR group and our advisors on Wednesday, January 23, 2002, we agreed that Janet Dietrich and I would co-lead, with HR and our advisors, the completion of the proposed Key Employee Retention and Severance Program for Enron.

A lot of ground work has been completed, however, we need to bring it together into a complete, concise and workable plan that can be negotiated and agreed to over the next two weeks.  Timing is critical.   In order to work towards retaining the intellectual capital required to maximize the value of the assets of the estate, the internal plan needs to be substantially complete by the close of business, Monday, January 28, 2002.  From there, we will endeavor to complete final discussions with the Creditors Committee and their advisors during the weeks of January 28 and February 4, 2002.  

We need your assistance between now and this Monday to complete the preparation work.

Specifically, Janet or I will schedule some time with you today, tomorrow, over the weekend or on Monday to review to following information for Debtor companies:

validation of the information that you have already provided to HR
obtain any additional information necessary to make sure that the HR file is complete and accurate
your business plan, by quarter, for the next several quarters
a clear illustration of the value that exists (as it is currently best understood), along with a plan to realize that value
a clear mapping of your personnel to the plan
projected role, by individual - discussion to include your view on near term activities (ex: data mining) versus longer term roles (ex: asset sales, etc)
projected completion time, by individual, by task - to realize the value
discussion, by individual, regarding the most appropriate type(s) of retention / severance to utilize for their intended role
services provided, by individual, to debtor and non-debtor companies - including IT system connections and ties, partial and complete headcount, etc.

For non-debtor companies, we need to discuss:

services provided, by groups and individuals in debtor companies, including level of reliance, ability to separate tasks, individual / group services, etc.
any other issues that you believe need to be discussed and considered in these discussions


Preliminarily, we have broken out the groups as follows:

Janet Dietrich (with Kalen Pieper and Shanna Funkhouser) will meet with the following:

Wholesale		Jim Fallon	
EBS		Rich DiMichele
EGM		Gary Hickerson
EIM		Rodney Malcolm
EA		Don Miller		
Ongoing Concern	Janet Dietrich
Operations		Bob Hall
IT			Piper / Dayao



Dan Leff  (with Robert Jones and Marla Barnard) will meet with the following:

Finance		Jeff McMahon
Treasury		Ray Bowen
A/P, Purchasing, Cash Management, Insurance, IR

Challenge

Appetite for credit capacity is much greater than what is justifiable given credit quality of industry and liquidity of transactions.

General Themes

Dearth of liquidity in market (bearing in mind that EIM's purpose is to stimulate liquidity)
Poor credit quality
Highly structured nature of steel transactions (inventory management, illiquid options, etc.)
M-T-M Accounting and incentives related to achieving earnings targets
Size, tenor and rating drive credit exposure; size and tenor drive transaction value -- therefore ratings drive credit limits.
Producers are naturally long; end-users are naturally short; Enron is neither and explicitly takes credit/market risk on both sides of a transaction

Short-term Solutions

Consider expanding "risk pool" (with concentration limits) to provide more flexibility to commercial teams (Pitfall:  could be rapidly depleted to achieve short-term budget targets)
Reduce size of transactions and increase volume to achieve greater diversity and less concentration
Prioritize counter-parties to give consideration to those of greater strategic importance
Clarify/[expand?] purpose of E-DASH

Action Items

Plan more formal education for Steel Group centered around:
M-T-M Accounting
Basic Credit Analysis and drivers of credit exposure
Market Risk Analysis
Determination of Credit Lines
Calculating Credit Reserves
Link Budget Process to Credit and Market Risk capacity allocations
More clearly define view of liquidity with regard to different types of transactions/commodities
Explore risk syndication options
Compare credit evaluation results across business units to ensure conformity throughout Enron--study should take into consideration credit rating, size of company, size of transaction, tenor of transaction and collateral rights

Rick/Bill/David,
Generally, we have managed to keep our main counterparts transacting, but things are tight.  We are signing netting agreements and agreeing to collateral threshholds, but we are negotiating hard where we think that we will be so close to collateral lines in the next few months that we would actually have to post.
As we go into this week, we need to hold on to those we have, incrementally open up a few more, and start to get people to business as usual.  Amongst the things that continues to be missing are the OFFICIAL STORY (we have access to the newspaper here, too), good communication regarding global relationships,
and calendar and status of new developments regarding credit facilities, equity issuance/raising.....  Not that some of it is getting through, it just comes through random channels and we know very little more than our counterparts that have a subscription to the Wall Street Journal.  To that end, it has been suggested here that Houston (PR?) with RAC/Finance develop a daily script of talking points for the masses.  We have traders and credit people talking all day to counterparts - they really could use a strong story to tell without have to think about it.  I am very confident that I can tell a reasonable story myself, but I am concerned that I do not have all the facts at my disposal and my guess is that the average trader/credit specialist is probably at a greater disadvantage.
Thoughts?
Ted

Rick - further to our discussion, here is the change Enron Americas are requesting in their limit structure:

Eliminate volumetric limits on net open position and maturity gap;
Eliminate limits on individual commodities within the business unit;
Replace with one limit, expressed in VaR, for the entire business unit, of $100MM.

I am not uncomfortable with $100MM, given the opportunity set and the required returns from this activity. ETL at this level could be in the region of $340MM.

I think the other things to consider in making the decision are as follows:

Does the VaR tell us sufficient about the risk ?

I think it does since we have the ability to see components of it in some detail and it backtests well

Tail Risks

Generally we have the most data on tail risks for US gas and power and we are most confident about the EVaR and ETL measures for these commodities.

Liquidity

This should be a key point in removing volumetric limits because they give us a concept of size. Our recent analysis has shown that our ability to unload risk in US natural gas certainly is high (50% reduction, 10 days) - but we need to continually revisit this analysis.

Administration of Risk

Generally I think we are comfortable - deal capture is good since so many trades are picked up through EOL.
Delegation of authority using VaR limits at desk level is strong 

But since VaR is so dependent on MTM values and curves I would still recommend a review of:

curve validation results;
ageing of confirmations outstanding (in and out);
flash to actual differences (if any)

Compliance with Policy

The policy requires limits under the business unit by "commodity groups" in some combination of volumetric and VaR limits. We also must approve products/commodities for a business unit.

One interpretation of this is to define the commodity "group" as the aggregate of gas, power, coal, crude, and approve those products, in which case the aggregate limit for the business unit is the commdity group limit also - so we can have one limit. 

Our concern about the Firm blowing up because everyone is short crude, for example, is covered by the fact that we can still see all the components of our aggregate risk to a single commodity, which is also capped by the concentration limits. The only question is from a governance standpoint, how you prevent yourself bumping up against those and having to explain it to the board.

Another side of this argument is the "10K analogy" - if I put $100MM into my 10K via a mutual fund I am likely to want them to declare in which markets they invest it.

To summarize, I think we could justify losing volumetric limits for this business. On the question of level of risk and commodity limits, I think we should talk it over with Greg / Ken.

Shona,

 As per my memo to you on August 13th, I am scheduling a kick-off meeting with individuals to discuss a daily tie-out process across all global risk applications/reports, i.e. DPR, Infinity, RisktRAC (VAR and Benchmark) and CAS.  This would provide proof (or a trail to what is missing)  that required information from all risk books, commodities, and business units are appropriately reported on a daily basis.  As stated earlier, without a robust global books application, the daily process currently in place provides little assurance that "everything" rolls up correctly.  It also does not include Infinity.  


My suggestion for attendance at this meeting, in addition to you, Beth and I, is as follows:

	Stacey White
	Todd Hall
	Sheila Glover/Clara Carrington
	Kevin Sweeney
	Kristin Albrecht
	Mike Jordan
	Jeff Gossett
	Scott Mills
	Ramesh Ganapathy
	Debbie Brackett

Please let me know today if you agree with this list and I will move forward getting the meeting scheduled and work on a presentation/agenda for you and Beth to approve.  

Thanks for your help.

Wanda

Rick/Jim

1)  It has come to my attention that the relocation of employees to home countries is in jeopardy.  Third hand, I understand that Prudential has refused to continue to pack, move and pay air fare to people seeking to move due to concern about clawback of payments made by the bankruptcy court.  Many of those literally have no money.  Is there any way to get the facts out to everyone and to address these issues?  These are questions of legitimate expenses addressing basic human needs like food, clothing and shelter.  

2) I would suggest that we grab(pay)  in-house counsel here that understands the business (Paul Simons?) in lieu of paying Weil for what I percieve as little or no value added.

3) As stated in yesterday's meeting, we will need to rely on EEL employees to do things like maintain books, provide settlements/invoices, accounting and banking among others.  They either work for the administrator or have been let go by the administrator.  Some provision to pay them needs to happen quickly.

4) FYI - I spoke with David Messer, the head of Sempra Energy Trading, yesterday.  David had been with Drexel during its bankruptcy.  He said that all retained employees received an immediate 100% increase in pay (on the day of the filing) and did not intimate that such things as economy class airfares to repatriate employees needed to be reviewed by Congress.

I realize that everyone is in some level of chaos, but based on what I read in the press, there are lots of decisions being made where the priorities - legally, morally, and ethically - appear to be in an improper order.  Anything either of you can do to re-order such things would be appreciated.

Ted

Rick,
While I am not 100% sure of what Greg means by international credit, both B=
ill and I  have recognized that there is a facet of RAC/Credit function tha=
t we are not net long vis-a-vis the direction of the business, particularly=
 the non-energy commodity businesses - steel, metals, paper - as well as th=
e coal business and the crude complex.  What seems to be needed is some peo=
ple that have experience in structures (good and bad) that support the move=
ment of large packages of physical goods from the 3rd world to the first wo=
rld.  Knowledge of the subleties of l/c language, insurance products, dog c=
ounterparties, typical scams, money launderers, lay ranges, demurrage....To=
 that end, we both interviewed and subsequently hired John Collenette, head=
 of credit for an international trading organization - Trafigura.  John spe=
nt 10 years at Paribas and then the last 7 at Trafigura.  He went through 3=
 full rounds of interviews, primarily with the metals guys and incuding Mic=
hael Brown.  My plan was to install him as the 'team lead' in metals allowi=
ng him to get 'enronized' with the idea that he would expand his role to in=
clude global products and EIM.  I guess I will accelerate this process.
In addition, I have also hired a sr spec with metals experience from Koch. =
 We have interviewed a few other prospects with transactional credit experi=
ence.  We are planning to supplement some of this industry knowledge with T=
racy Ngo and a few strong managers with solid credit skills.  The issues we=
 have yet to begin getting traction are how to staff other offices - NY and=
 Sydney principally.  Here we are constrained by current budgets.

Also, I have worked with the operations staff to take away some of the oper=

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.

     James,
     
     As requested, attached please find a CRC due diligence list.  Please 
     note that we have asked one of our risk systems experts to come from 
     London to do on site work in Houston on Tuesday. I expect we will have 
     other members of our team down there as well.  We will contact CRO Buy 
     to arrange this on Monday, but you might tell the company as well.
     
     Thanks

I believe that now that we have signed, there is no condition precedent that will allow for the board to say no to the deal.  Given the prior understanding we had that this transaction did not require board approval I do not think we can or should ask for that approal now.

Over the past few weeks, we have experienced significant issues with our em=
ail environment that have caused business interruptions and frustration for=
 Outlook users.  The purpose of this e-mail is to outline the issues that w=
e have encountered and what we are doing to resolve the issues.=20
?=09During the last week of August, we encountered a bug in Microsoft's Exc=
hange Server -- the mail server that is used by Outlook clients.  This bug,=
 which impacted approximately 3,000 users, delayed mail delivery for the be=
tter part of a day.  At that time, we applied a fix from Microsoft which ap=
pears to have resolved the problem.  We have carefully monitored the Exchan=
ge servers for four weeks, and have not seen a re-occurrence of the bug.
?=09Also during the last week of August, another Exchange Server experience=
d database corruption issues -- again, this impacted approximately 3,000 Ou=
tlook users.  To resolve this, we moved the 3,000 users to different Exchan=
ge servers and made several hardware/software upgrades to the affected serv=
er.  We have not yet returned the repaired server to full production use --=
 we are closely monitoring it to ensure that there are no more problems wit=
h the server.  While this event did not cause e-mail outages during the bus=
iness week, we had to do maintenance on the server during the evenings on W=
ednesday, Thursday, and Friday, and throughout the Labor day weekend to mov=
e users to different servers.  During these evenings and weekend, the impac=
ted users could not access their e-mail.
?=09During the last three weeks, there have been a number of new and danger=
ous viruses on the internet.  We have a multi-layered defense against virus=
es that include virus scanning software on servers and desktops.  All mail =
is scanned on the Exchange servers and all files are scanned on the desktop=
s.  During the last few weeks, we have had to apply numerous virus scanning=
 updates to the Exchange servers - sometimes even several updates per day. =
 The result is that when new virus scanning updates arrive, the performance=
 of the Exchange servers diminishes for several hours while the anti-virus =
product rescans every message in every mailbox.  This is unfortunate, but w=
e believe necessary to prevent viruses from causing outages in the Enron co=
mputing environment and threaten our revenue generating systems.  At this t=
ime, we are working with the vendor to arrive at a technical solution that =
will speed up the virus scanning process.  We have made some progress as th=
e performance has improved during virus scans, however, it can continue to =
get better.
There is no question that the email issues we have encountered over the las=
t few weeks are unacceptable.  We are continuing to monitor and improve the=
 overall performance to ensure that we substantially reduce the outages and=
 meet Enron's business needs and expectations.

I have received questions about interpreting the ratio.   Let me use yesterday's closing price.   The merger probability is derived from a two scenario test, merger closure or merger non closure (there is also a competing offer scenario in reality).    Let's use a closing DYN price of $46.20 yesterday (note I had a typo), at the exchange ratio, (not taking into account timing and dividends), this yields a merged ENE price of $12.40 ($46.20 * .2685).   ENE closed at $10.00 yesterday.   Thus if the market thought there was complete certainty of merger, the prices would converge at $12.40.

Now comes the artful part, the non merger ENE price.    I included another tab (Merger) to sensitize this.  Say we pick an ENE price with no merger of $4.00.   Looking at a deterministic probability, one can look at the distance (difference) in dollars to calculate the probability.  For instance:

ENE merged           12.40
ENE close 14-Nov   10.00
ENE no merger         4.00

Probability of merger = (1-((12.40-10.00) / (12.40 - 4.00))) or 71.4%.   

Said another way, there is a 71.4% chance of being worth $12.40 and a 28.6% chance of being worth $4.00, which yields a weighted price of $10.00  ($12.40 * 71.4%)+($4.00 * 28.6%).

I also included a $1 distressed ENE price and a $7 previously observed low end ENE price as scenarios.


Regards,


Michael

They're in the mail!  Thanks to everyone in Portfolio for a great team effort in pulling together our most recent board package. Our Reporting Group led the charge by putting in some long hours and addressing numerous challenges including developing data with the Credit and Market Risk groups on new charts such as the Liquidity Ratio Analysis.  The Compliance group took on the entire responsiblility for the DASH book which freed up our Reporting Group to deal with some of the challenges noted above.  Due Diligence and PortRAC personnel worked on several important projects in connection with the presentations such as Foreign exchange.  Everyone helped with proofing and final assembly.  Again, thanks to all for a great job!!       Rick C.

The physical short position that NPW has with their customers is indeed in the money to NPW generally (they struck contracts at above market prices) and market prices have fallen since.   To hedge their portfolio, NPW entered into a long position with Enron.  David Port of the Market Risk Managment group in RAC found a fairly matched book.  It is true that two offsetting positions will liquidate, over time, at no loss.    

The difference here is that NPW overhead is so large that, absent an equity injection, they would default to their creditors prior to the expiry of these positions.   I would use this simple analogy, NPW has a physical short, an offsetting physical and financial long, and a significantly out of the money overhead which greatly outpaced any margin (almost nil for 2000) they have in their contracts.

I hope this helps.  If you need to find me this weekend, try me at 713.515.3577.

Michael, I want you to have one initial comment.  Joe Cialone talked with
outside counsel for NPW who made the point that they did not understand why
Enron needed collateral because NPW was hedged.  While that comment is is
not logical, the information on the hedges causes me to ask why Manley is so
concerned with price movement if indeed NPW has its positions hedged.  Do we
have  information on NPW's book?  David

Please see attached a United Way Contribution Summary by Business Unit as of Wednesday morning, August 10.  This summary includes the total contribution amount to date, percent participation, campaign goal, and percent of goal for each business unit, as well as the functional groups within your business units.  Currently we are at 77%, or $2.25M, of our financial goal with only 42% participation.  

These numbers are still significantly lower than where we were this time last year and we continue to need your help!  If you will do the following throughout the remainder of the campaign, I know it would help exceed our goal of $2.9M.

?	Continue to send out reminder emails including the United Way link
?	Continue to have personal dialogue with your direct reports and those in your group

Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this report or the campaign in general.  Thank you for your participation and support of this year's campaign.

Dan, in response to the following memo, can you discuss with Rick his ideas.  I would also like to go through a detailed description of each EES office, its people and functions to determine which should be eliminated and which should be modified.  Given the latest redeployments and terminations the field offices are a shadow of their previous stature either way.  This is consistent with our overall strategies but perhaps we want to accelerate.  If you could help set up the framework to discuss I would much appreciate.

Good job on handling the "5's".

Regards
Delainey

Subject:	Remote Offices- Suggestions

After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:

1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.

---or----

2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.

There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.

Any thoughts? Rick

Rick, thanks for getting back to me. Dave and I are trying desperately to get the on-going concern business set up. We've got a bunch of very talented folks tentatively committed (obviously subject to real viability here, retention packages, severence packages, employment contracts, etc). If you have some key folks you'd like me to talk with, I'd be more than happy to give them my view of what we can make of this (I'm actually fairly optimistic here!). We need to have highly-skilled folks in the RAC/audit functions supporting this business.

Janet - thanks for your note. Following are my thoughts. First, I am not going to Netco. (Long story). Second, I have spoken with Ken Lay and Jeff McMahon about the continuation of RAC and my leading it. They both want RAC to continue and want me to lead it and also combine an internal audit function with RAC as well (to be determined more definitively). 

Jim has also requested that some RAC folks be near his operation as you have which I totally understand. I think I will assign a couple people to his floor but keep the bulk of our operation on 28. We have counterparty credit files on 15,000 counterparties as well as Dash libraries and other info that require large secure space.

My final issue is that I have had three credit people leave this week so my situation is getting critical. I need to get Netco people away from 28 and get remaining RAC people sitting together and feeling like a team. Everyone is looking and the market is hot for our credit and market risk people. 

I hope this addresses your issue.

Rick

Hi Rick. Hope your holding up. We are going to have all of the "on-going concern" activities here in the old building on the 30-31-32 floors. We will be splitting the estate infrastructure into two functions: on-going activities (contracts/assets we will continue to serve and perform under) and wind-up/liquidation activities. Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and I believe he is staying in the new building for now.

We need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the on-going concern function. I'd prefer that we continue to have them located near our floors vs. move to another location (as I hear through the grapevine). Could you suggest the folks that would be available to focus exclusively on on-going concern activities, and do you want them to stay on the 28th floor or move onto 31 with us?

Thanks.

We just got notice of new cash control procedures.  Each Thursday, RAC will have to submit to Corp. Accounting a list of payees and amounts that need to be paid for the following two weeks.   All cash expenditures (excluding payroll & benefits) such as fax machine rental, expense accts, cell phones, office supplies, etc will need to be submitted regardless of amount. 

Sharon Sullo and I will coordinate for RAC.  We are going to build a spreadsheet with all of the recurring items and establish a reporting system for non-recurring items going forward.  All of the requests for RAC will be aggregated and submitted to Rick Buy for approval before sending to Corp.  Our first report is due by 5:00 PM today.

Your assistance is appreciated.   Rick C.

Michael, I want you to have one initial comment.  Joe Cialone talked with
outside counsel for NPW who made the point that they did not understand why
Enron needed collateral because NPW was hedged.  While that comment is is
not logical, the information on the hedges causes me to ask why Manley is so
concerned with price movement if indeed NPW has its positions hedged.  Do we
have  information on NPW's book?  David

Here are the credit and VAR lists for today.  I have written notes in the V=
AR list (the attached spreadsheet) on a book by book basis indicating what =
I think the status of each book is (ie whether the book will be officialize=
d going fwd).  There are still some questions I have concerning certain boo=
ks.

Can each of you review this list and confirm that I have the correct status=
?  Also, I need to talk to Scott Mills, Michelle Bruce, Kristin Albrecht, J=
enny Latham, and Didrik Thrane-Nielsen specifically as I need to obtain a c=
omplete understanding of what their risk groups are doing.

Credit and Market risk - I'll keep you updated with changes in the status o=
f the books.  Right now, I know we will have to rerun VAR either later this=
 morning or early this pm.  I expect CAS will have to be rerun too.

Best regards,

Shona

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Houston Users
 
Just a reminder, the access codes for remote locations were modified within the Enron Building phone system.  The modifications will affect users as follows:  
                                
1.        We have changed the first digit dialed when accessing the Tie Lines from 7 to 8.  This change will only affect Enron Building users.
2.        The second and third digits of the London, Calgary, Omaha, and Portland tie lines have also changed.  This change will affect all users.  All other digits of existing dial strings will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings is identified in the table below.

To:	The Enron Management Committee


The Enron Corp. Board of Directors approved a new Risk Management Policy (the "Policy") on August 14, 2001, and notice has been distributed to Enron employees to announce the posting of this policy on the Enron intranet website at http://home.enron.com/resources (without market risk limits due to confidentiality).  The Policy includes a three page Executive Summary providing an overview of risk management practices for the four major types of risks addressed: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk and (d) liquidity/funding risk, and this summary is attached to this e-mail for your convenience.  The credit policy was incorporated without change, and the Transaction Approval Process and Guarantee Approval Processes were also incorporated with updating for specific approval authorities. 

This e-mail message is being sent to the Enron Management Committee to highlight some key aspects of the Company's market risk management practices which may be of interest.  

The Policy established a new Risk Management Committee, members of which are the Chief Risk Officer and any others designated by the CEO of Enron Corp.  During this transition period, existing Commodity Group Limits as of August 14th remain in effect, and Enron Business Unit Limits are assigned accordingly.  These limits may be further adjusted by the Risk Management Committee and the CEO, and your market risk managers will be working with you to review the limit structure for your business unit's activities to facilitate compliance with the Policy and your business initiatives.  RAC is currently working with Global Risk Management Operations to develop appropriate risk reporting that meets the Policy requirements and the needs of business unit management.

Cassandra Schultz
Vice President, RAC

Summary of Changes to Market Risk Management Practices

In addition to consolidating Enron's various risk management policies and procedures into one comprehensive Policy, some substantive changes and clarifications were made to the Company's market risk management practices, as summarized below.  

1.	Increased the VaR Limit for the Trading Portfolio, providing discretion to the Enron Corp. CEO ("CEO") to allocate such VaR limits within defined parameters
2.	Established an Expected Tail Loss Advisory Limit for the Trading Portfolio
3.	Revised the Market Risk Limit Structure within each Portfolio to delegate more discretion for individual Business Unit and Commodity Group limits to the CEO and Risk Management Committee
a)   Concentration VaR Limits approved by Board of Directors 
b)   Business Unit VaR Limits approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
c)   Commodity Group Limits for each Business Unit approved by CEO / Risk Management Committee
d)   Trader/Desk Limits approved by Business Unit Office of the Chairman


Key Points re: the Limit Structure
1.	Concentration Limits are established on 6 large buckets of commodity groups; this bucketing focuses on market indicators from a Board perspective, not according to Enron's organizational structure; 
?	1) Americas Gas, 2) Americas Power, 3) European Gas & Power, 
4) Products, 5) Financials, and 6) Emerging Businesses
o	Examples:  Americas Power Concentration Limit includes Global Risk Markets; Financials Concentration Limit includes Credit; Appendix A of the Policy lists the individual Commodity Groups comprising each Concentration Limit
2.	CEO/Risk Management Committee has discretion to allocate the Trading Portfolio VaR limit among the Enron Business Units, subject to the Concentration Limits approved by the Board
3.	Expected Tail Loss is a new risk metric, and accordingly, an advisory limit is established only at the total Trading Portfolio level; some Commodity Groups may have the measurement calculated in RisktRAC, but no limit is set
4.	Business Unit VaR Limits are to be set for each Enron Business Unit (i.e. Enron Americas, Enron Global Markets, Enron Europe, etc. - any Business Units recognized as having authority for trading by the CEO)
5.	Commodity Group Limits are now to be set at a Business Unit level, representing the individual Business Unit's authority for trading specific commodities
?	every Business Unit shall have a Commodity Group Limit for any commodities for which they are authorized to trade; 
?	these Commodity Group Limits and corresponding risk reporting will enable top management and the Risk Management Committee to quickly understand risk parameters on a "pure" commodity group basis within each Enron Business Unit;
6.	Each Enron Business Unit OOC can establish Trader/Desk Level Limits and/or related risk reporting as they require, enabling them to view their trading results the way they manage their business (i.e., the same trader may actually trade more than one commodity, and therefore wish to view risk parameters for several commodities combined, etc.)

Risk Management Benefits of Limit Structure: 1) CEO flexibility below the Concentration Limit level, and 2) individual Enron Business Units have clearly defined trading authority, enabling the Risk Management Committee to authorize business units to trade in the same commodities while strengthening risk management practices to facilitate compliance with the Board approved Concentration Limits 

Limit Monitoring and Reporting
1.	All position and VaR violations are triggered at 100% of the respective limit
2.	All Daily Loss notifications are triggered at 100% of the VaR limit
3.	All Cumulative 5-day Loss notifications are triggered at 225% of the VaR limit 
4.	Trading Portfolio limit monitoring reported to the Board
5.	Concentration limit monitoring reported up to the CEO, and at Board meetings
6.	Business Unit and Commodity Group limit monitoring reported up to the Risk Management Committee
7.	Trader/Desk Level Limits and related reporting to be established by each business unit

Overall Portfolio Structure
?	Expanded the Trading Portfolio includes all of Enron's mark-to-market trading activity, including speculative trading of PGE and ETS 
?	Merchant Portfolio does not have established limits
?	Clarified that the Capital Portfolio is to capture and manage all positions related to Enron's capital structure; the VaR limit established is a Concentration Limit for Enron stock related transactions; as other positions are captured and measured, additional limits may be established as needed
Added a new "Regulated" Portfolio for certain transportation and distribution activities (a VaR limit was established by the Board for PGE's regulated activities)
?	Added a new "Other Assets & Contracts" Portfolio to capture and manage accrual or other type of positions not otherwise captured in the other Portfolios; no limits established

All,

Attached is a draft of a revised DASH template to better reflect some of the considerations required for asset divestitures in light of Enron's Chapter 11 status.  Please let me know if you have any comments; after any comments have been incorporated, we will plan to use this as the DASH template going forward.

Thanks and regards,

Dave

Dear Richard

Here's to wishing you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!!!!! I 
think that 2002 is going to be a much better year than 2001!!!!!

Here's a great article from the most recent issue of Fast Company. All

indicators point towards a turnaround.

PS I apoligize if you got this email message twice;  I have two email

Digital Matters - Issue 52
Most everyone has written off the dotcoms. Smart investors are finding
the 
real value.
by Fast Company
illustrations by Jack Unruh
from FC issue 52, page 74
Alt Text

Every nine months McKinsey and Co., the world's premier management 
consultancy, publishes an "e-performance" survey of more than 200 Internet

businesses around the world. These dotcom companies have combined revenues

of roughly $2 billion. The most recent survey, published in May 2001,
found 
that 20% of the companies covered were profitable and that a significant

number of the others were heading in that direction.
Dotcoms that were making money were "e-tailers," with clothing e-tailers

doing particularly well. Companies that were losing money were content

sites; news and sports sites were struggling the most. Monika Kubicova,
one 
of four McKinsey consultants who oversee the survey, told the Financial

Times, "For e-tailers there is quite good reason for optimism, with a

reasonable number starting to show profitability. Content businesses,

however, are still playing with their business models and are in the red."
The McKinsey survey received virtually no press coverage, because it did
not 
fit the major media's prevailing conventional wisdom, which is that the

Internet sector in general -- and the dotcom sector in particular -- is
as 
dead as smelts. But as the survey makes clear, for something so dead,
these 
sectors are showing all kinds of life. This past July, a streamlined 
priceline.com announced that it had turned a second-quarter profit. Google,

the search-engine site that is now run by former Novell wizard Eric Schmidt,

recently announced that it was solidly profitable. EBay, Travelocity.com,

and a host of other companies also reported strong second-quarter earnings.

All of these solid performances occurred in the teeth of a global economic

slowdown.
Indeed, the big, largely unreported summer story of 2001 was the renewal
of 
financial interest in all things related to the Internet. Goldman Sachs
and 
other major investment houses swarmed across Europe, bottom-fishing among

distressed telecom and wireless properties. Deal flow in 
Internet-infrastructure companies quickened in the United States as price

points became much more "realistic." Even seemingly doomed content companies

such as Salon.com attracted funding.
A couple of years from now, people will look back on the summer of 2001
as 
the time when the music started up again. Dan Burstein, a managing partner

of Millennium Technology Ventures LP ( MTVLP ), is one among many smart

investors who see the wind shifting. For almost 15 months, Burstein says,

MTVLP didn't see a deal that was worth the price of admission. In fall
2000, 
MTVLP knew of one that was priced at $1 billion. By spring 2001, that
exact 
same deal was valued at below $100 million. At $1 billion, the deal was
an 
almost perfect metaphor for Internet insanity. At below $100 million,
it was 
a good investment. MTVLP bought a stake. Burstein sees the current situation

as analogous to the savings-and-loan crisis and the great real-estate

collapse of the late 1980s to early 1990s. The S&L meltdown led to 
write-offs of more than $500 billion and caused a meltdown in the 
real-estate sector. At the time, there was much talk about "overcapacity"

and "glut" in the real-estate mark!
ets. Today, the telecom industry may have to write off anywhere from $300

billion to $1 trillion in bad debt. And that has caused severe distress
in 
the Internet-infrastructure world.
Having worked at the Blackstone Group LP prior to setting up MTVLP, Burstein

has good institutional memory of what a big opportunity looks like. Under

the direction of former commerce secretary Pete Peterson, Blackstone 
surveyed the wreckage of the S&L/real-estate crisis and decided to establish

a separate entity to get in on the action -- even though Blackstone had
no 
prior experience in real-estate investing. The company ended up buying

packets of properties, and when the market revived in the latter half
of the 
1990s, Blackstone sold them off at a staggering profit. Burstein thinks
that 
the telecom and Internet shakeout of the past two years is an investing

opportunity of similar size and scope.
Consider the prevailing wisdom that there is a bandwidth glut. You can
read 
a thousand research reports on the Internet, and invariably you will find

someone whining about this glut. It is certainly true that the information

superhighways running down the fiber-optic lines between major metropolitan

areas are, for the moment, underutilized. But does that mean that they
will 
be underutilized in five or seven years?
The likely answer to that question: Of course not. Pervasive computing
means 
that new appliances, new security systems, new HVAC installations in 
buildings, whether commercial or residential, will communicate with server

farms to exchange information constantly. Peer-to-peer technology will
have 
computers talking back and forth to one another, constantly updating 
information for millions of end users. Gaming will continue to grow and

become for the echo-boom generation what television was for the baby 
boomers.
All of these technologies will be added to an ever-growing traffic flow
of 
email, messaging, searches, and business communications. Enabling all
of 
this technology will require enormous amounts of bandwidth and gargantuan

amounts of what George Gilder calls "storewidth": the response time between

entering a request on the Web and getting back the first page. Bandwidth
and 
storewidth companies have been hammered over the course of the past 18

months, to the point where they are now selling at relatively reasonable

prices. Like the real-estate glut of the late 1980s, the bandwidth glut
of 
the early 2000s is almost certainly a temporary phenomenon. So it's not

surprising that major investment houses are scouring the countryside,

looking at Internet-infrastructure companies that will enable the coming
of 
all of these new technologies.
It will take a number of years before we know which investors made the
right 
bets. The secret of business success is that much of it derives from luck

and timing. But after 18 months of virtually no activity, with huge pools
of 
investment money sitting on the sidelines in cash accounts, the great
game 
has quietly restarted. Investment companies are back at the table placing

their bets. And the biggest bets are being wagered in the beleaguered

telecom sector, which makes sense. European telecoms in particular overpaid

for spectrum licenses and, in doing so, jeopardized their franchises.
Now 
they must sell off key assets to stay afloat. Those assets are selling
at a 
significant discount. Situations like that attract big money very fast.
The next wave will occur in the Internet-infrastructure sector as companies

with strong market positions but weak cash flow hit the wall and grow

desperate. The last wave will be in a whole range of dotcom companies
-- 
especially shopping bots. As peer-to-peer computing advances, shopping
bots 
will not only be able to find you the best price on any given item, but
they 
will also give you the ability to auction out your business. Kids need

back-to-school clothes? Bid your business out on the Internet, and the
Gap 
will have to offer you $1,000 worth of merchandise for $850. If it doesn't,

Target will.
Ever since April 14, 2000, the question has been, When is this thing (
the 
Internet business, for lack of a better phrase ) going to turn around?
The 
answer is in that McKinsey survey and in the behavior of some of the world's

leading investors: It's turning around now. If the S&L/real-estate crisis
is 
a suitable analogy, it'll take about five years to get from here to there.

Along the way, there's lots of money to be made.

Take a look at these pics! For anyone who has worked or visited the WTC area, these pics are incredible. Just looking at the devastation to the surrounding buildings is shocking.  My friend worked at Banker's Trust at 130 Liberty and these pictures were taken from and around that building. Sherron

Subject:	Potential Sale of E&P Assets 

Teresa and I spoke with Sharon Butcher today who recommended that the potential sale of E&P portfolio should be described and approved at this preliminary stage by Lavorato, Haedicke, Goerte, and Lay et al per policy regarding conflicts. A DASH would follow when the deal gets further along. The issue here is John Thompson and other employees potentially "negotiating a deal" which would include their getting equity in the company which purchases assets. Donna and I just spoke and our thoughts are that the deal description currently in draft form would be circulated with an approval cover sheet explaining the reason for the approval sought.

FYI - Teresa and  I are meeting with the HR rep and the Enron employment attorney this aft and then all with John so that he understands what process should be followed re the employees - ie his communications with them and with potential purchasers. NAncy

Rick,
     As discussed earlier, most of the Research group does not want to come along.  Given that, here are some names of people who are capable, and who may be more willing to stay on board.  I have put folks with a valuation focus, who could help out on deal revaluations, etc.   
Naveen

Tried to call you.  I think that we need to talk or meet.  We need to differentiate between "asset sales", book liquidations, and other types of transactions (ie. contract rejections).

Subject:	Revised DASH

Ray,

We are working on revising the DASH template in order that it can be readily used for asset divestitures, contract terminations, and amendments to transactions.  The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction.  This is consistent with past practice (although presumably only business unit, RAC, and legal sign-offs would occur prior to committee review) and with your memo of earlier today.

Your thoughts as to how the approval process should occur after a DASH is prepared would be appreciated.

Regards,

Dave

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Talking to S&P now.  They are under attack in the press for being too slow to downgrade.  They want to come in here later this week to "sit on the trading floor" to get a close up feel for how things are going.  I'll let you know when this is scheduled.

Molly,

Attached is the spreadsheet that outlines TNPC's billing and receipt history. There were a few invoices out over 30 days but the majority pay within 10 days after due date, some even before the due date.  Out of the $435k that is outstanding, there is an invoice for $234k that went to the gas desk (James Barker)  today for proof of delivery and volume issues. This amount was not marked on the dispute log. Another invoice for 91k is currently on the dispute log for an undertake penalty and has come to partial resolution. The remaining $134k is a collection issue as collection calls to Chris Miceli have not indicated a dispute, but rather a confirmation to pay. Due to the nature of this customer, CSC handles the collection of this customer internally. Please let me know if you need any additional information.

Joni Fisher

I will likely begin polling the Board tomorrow for availability for a special meeting to consider Project Southwood (again!).  Please advise if you are aware of any other agenda items that are critical in terms of timing.  Thanks.  Paula

Louise- We need to get Netco people and UBS off the floor on 28. It is demoralizing to the remaining estate people and I am having a huge problem keeping people in their seats. Three have quit this week and we need the ones that remain. Can you make this happen rapidly? Thanks, Rick

Subject: Risk Management Policy Mandatory Certification=20

On August 14, 2001, the Board of Directors of Enron Corp. (the "Board") app=
roved a new and revised Enron Risk Management Policy (the "Policy").  The B=
oard amended the Policy on October 9, 2001.  The Policy covers Enron Corp. =
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") and focuses on procedures for managing=
 the Company's exposure to risk as encountered in the normal course of busi=
ness.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposu=
re to risk will be evaluated, managed and controlled and pursuant to which =
capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy also focuses on four m=
ajor types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk =
and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks will be managed on a portfolio=
 basis with standard transactions being subject to various market risk limi=
t structures and credit approval processes and non-standard transactions be=
ing subject to the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval =
Process.   Finally, the Policy provides an overview of the various risk mea=
surement tools and limits that will be applied to risk, and the roles and r=
esponsibilities of both key participants and normal employees in the risk m=
anagement framework. =20

All managers and relevant employees of the Company are responsible for comp=
lying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in the Pol=
icy and are required to sign a Compliance Certificate indicating their unde=
rstanding of and compliance with the Policy. =20

As we move forward in the planning stages for NETCO we need to identify all systems which need to be moved or copied into the entity.  We have identified the great majority of the systems to be moved but we may not be able to identify particular tools used by your group or you individually.  This would include spreadsheets etc.

Please send lists of systems and software required to Anne Koehler by close of business today.

To be clear we can (subject to the negotiation) move/copy systems and some data however, we CANNOT move either transaction data if counterparty specific or data obtained from a counterparty under a confidentiality agreement.

For Houston traders, Geof Storey is compiling your lists.

Thanks

Louise

Raising of the Kursk
Frans van Seumeren
President and CEO of Mammoet
 
 
The Kursk sank in the Barents Sea following an explosion in August 2000.  The Ministry of Defense of the Russian Federation contracted with Mammoet to recover the Kursk.  The scope included cutting away the bow section, raising and suspending the main section below pontoons, and towing the main section to a drydock in Murmansk.  Extensive simulations and model testing were conducted to develop and validate the lifting and towing operations.  Managing the project required close cooperation with the Russian Navy and the submarine designer to design the overall lifting program. 
 
Frans van Seumeren initiated, negotiated and concluded the Kursk contract with the Russian Government for the operation to salvage the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk.  He will describe the technical and operational aspects of the recovery.

Hi Richard,
     
I am writing to let you know (if you have not heard already) that over
twenty-five former Regional Directors of the Global Association of Risk
Professionals (GARP) have formed a new international nonprofit
association of risk managers. The new association, called the
Professional Risk Managers' International Association (PRMIA, pronounced
as "premia"), will include local chapters in Europe, Asia, the Middle
East, North America and South America. If you would like to know more
about the new organisation and how to join please email me and I will be
happy to give you more details.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards

Geoff Kates

Louise- Any notion of amount of risk bidders are comfy with, both credit and market? I doubt anything specific has been discussed but have any ranges been thrown out. Hope all is well. Happy New Year. Rick

Subject: FW: Re-start/Integration Planning



Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing. 

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart. 

Thanks 

Louise

Subject:        Re-start/Integration Planning 

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+       Infrastructure          Jenny Rub 
+       Development             Jay Webb 
+       EnronOnline             Webb / Forster 
+       HR                      David Oxley 
+       Cash Management Tom Myers 
+       Credit                  Debbie Brackett 

The rest will be completed shortly. 

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Customer Side   
+       Customers               Phase  1 - First Week (eg top 10) 
                                Phase  2 - First Month (eg top 50) 
                                Phase  3 - First Quarter (eg top 100) 
+       Action Plan             Phase  1 Customers 
                                Phase  2 Customers 
                                Phase  3 Customers 
+       Contracts by customers (pre-prepared with credit terms etc) 
+       Customer visit schedule 

Product Side 
+       List of Products        Phase 1 - First Week 
                                Phase 2 - First Month 
                                Phase 3 - First Quarter 

Target Number of Transactions 
+       Phase 1 
+       Phase 2 
+       Phase 3 

IT transfer

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other.

Rick,
     A slight clarification on the RoCaR as it pertains to Market/Credit side:  The analysis is performed only on DASHed deals, so nearly all of deals going through Market/Credit would end up in Underwriting too, for which Mark Walker is the RoCaR contact.

This analysis is currently not done on traded deals which are not DASHed.  

Naveen

You are going to love this one!  From a friend in California.

Akhmed came to the United States from Afghanistan, and he
was only here a few months when he became very ill.  He went
to doctor after doctor, but none of them could help him.

Finally, he went to an Arab doctor.  The doctor said,
"Take dees bucket, go into de odder room, shit in de bucket,
piss on de shit, and den put  your head down over de bucket
and breathe in de fumes for ten minutes."

Akmed took the bucket, went into the other room, shit
in the  bucket, pissed on the shit, bent over and breathed
in the fumes for ten minutes.

Coming back to the doctor he said, "It worked. I feel
terrific!   What was it?"

The doctor said, "You were homesick."

Our current book exposure from TNPC down to $5 is approximately $225 million (this is the credit deficiency in Raptor today).  Below $5, Enron has an additional $286 million of TNPC exposure (see attachment for components).

Would you forward to this group, on my behalf, the analysis of the remaining TNPC exposure?  Be sure and include the current exposure down to $5.  Thanks

If we have the flexibility to afford a potential significant acceleration of NewPower losses/liquidity issues ie) going to zero and we feel we have our trade credit adequately secured then the right call is probably to abandon the seats.   Mark what is your view?

We are working hard to address the immediate New Power exposure.  Dave:  FYI it might actually involve Service Co. Mark, we are talking to Jimmie this morning on that idea. We will certainly review overall exposure as a part of this.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:

Mike Peterson asked me to send you the following note, with attached order:

Attached is an Order signed yesterday and entered this morning by Judge Rosenthal on Plaintiffs' Motion for TRO and Preliminary Injunctive Relief (including a freeze of defendants' "insider trading proceeds") - i.e., the matter on which there was a hearing with attendant media hoopla last month.

You probably recall that at the end of the hearing, Judge Rosenthal asked for briefing on a rather arcane legal point concerning whether or not the Court had authority to issue the requested preliminary relief, and the parties submitted briefs on this matter on December 15 and December 21. 

In the attached Order, Judge Rosenthal concludes that the Court does have the requisite authority, but the present record does not contain evidence warranting a freeze of any individual defendant's proceeds from the sale of Enron stock.

You might take further comfort from two additional points in the Court's opinion: (a) at several places, the Court clearly indicates that any "freeze" or other such injunctive relief as to any defendant would have to be predicated on an individualized evidentiary showing as to that defendant; and (b) the Court indicates that plaintiffs would have to satisfy a very difficult "tracing" requirement to establish a right to a constructive trust or freeze (i.e., "trace" a specific asset or fund of money held by any defendant back to the profits of an improper insider trade).

The aspects of the Court's opinion that arguably are favorable to the plaintiffs are (a) the discussion of "an equitable accounting," wherein the Court suggests that the plaintiffs might be able to satisfy the requirements for an order that defendants account for profits earned by trading Enron securities between October 1998 and November 2001; and (b) providing an opportunity (through January 23) for plaintiffs to file a brief addressing whatever expedited discovery they believe they are entitled to as to the individual defendants, "particularly as to . . . Kenneth Lay, Jeffrey Skilling, and Andrew Fastow."

We will, of course, advise you of any further developments.

- Mike Peterson

As always, please do not hesitate to call or e-mail us if you have questions or comments.

Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

Louise

We have for the last couple of weeks started to compile the Re-start/Integration Plans for Netco.  So far, we have primarily focussed on the mid/back plans where the technology requirements have been the driving factors.  Several plans are  in progress:-

+	Infrastructure		Jenny Rub
+	Development		Jay Webb
+	EnronOnline		Webb / Forster
+	HR			David Oxley
+	Cash Management	Tom Myers
+	Credit			Debbie Brackett

The rest will be completed shortly.

We now need to focus on the commercial plans which have a slightly different focus. John and I would like to receive the plans "Re-start/Integration"  plans by January 7th, 2002 in order to go through them individually with each of you or in groups.  The focus should be to ensure that we have as much of the business up and running in the shortest time possible.  I have a suggested outline which you do not have to use but I thought it might help.  Please decide within yourselves the areas you will cover together or individually.

Rick, Attached is the significantly scaled down version of the RAC presentation we anticipate using for the taped Bloomberg mid-year credit review.  Please let me know if you have any comments or other changes once you have had a chance to review.  As we discussed earlier, we do not yet know when the taping will be.  If it is after August 15th, we will plan on working with Bill Bradford and Dave Gorte on this. Thanks.  Shirley

Since Sharron Westbrook has been the person providing notices regarding our=
 EES/EWS Thursday meetings, I have forwarded this suggested language to her=
 to use in notifiying all attendees of our planned changes for the meeting.=
  You and I discussed resuming the meetings during the first week in Septem=

week.  Beth Apollo has had a house under construction since her return from=
 London and should be moving in on September 1st.  She plans to take off th=
at week to get moved in and settled, and to start her 2 year-old into her n=
ew school.  We could try to patch Beth in by phone that week, but I think w=
e would be better off having her here.  So I made an "executive" decision t=
o resume the next week, on September 13.  That will also give me time to ge=
t with you during the first week in September, while Beth is out, to review=
 with you the reporting tools that we will have developed for use in the me=
etings.  Hope that all of this is okay with you.=20

I have left Rick Causey and Dan Leff messages regarding the outcome of our =
discussions last week regarding this Thursday meeting.   =20

Beth and I have set aside time on Thursday this week to devise appropriate =
tracking and reporting tools to use in the meeting.  -Sally=20

Rick - I intend to go to this, but it seems strange that David can't.  Can you make an exception? Seems like he should.  Clearly some Sr. Directors are more active parts of the "management team" than others...

Just a thought,

Cassandra.

After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

Subject:	Expertfinder Data
Importance:	High

I work in Risk Assessment and Control (RAC) and one of our tasks is to prepare quarterly information that is presented to the Enron Board of Directors.  The Board has requested background information on the employees of RAC such as education, certifications, etc. plus a picture.  I would like to know if there is a way I could work with you to get this information out of Expertfinder instead of having to manually look up and record data for close to 75 employees.  The most helpful thing for me would be if you could query your data to pull RAC employees and then send me a data file containing all the information (education, certifications, picture if possible, etc.).  

As far as I know, this is a one time request and it is not due until the next Board meeting which is the beginning of December.  However, we would like to get started on this as soon as possible since this is a request in addition to the usual items we present to the Board each quarter.

Please let me know if you can help us in this process.  Feel free to call me to discuss.

Subject:	Accro

Ernesto, can you please provide the following information:

1.	Please confirm that the date that Accro commenced commercial operation was 7/6/2001

The Accroven Commercial Operations start date was July 09, 2001.
.
2.	At the time Accro payouts were approved for payment relative to financial close, the projected NPV of cash flows related to Enron's interest was $18.331 million.  An updated NPV calculation, reviewed and signed off on by RAC is required, to determine what, if any, additional payments might be presented to the Compensation Committee for approval.  Norm Spalding has supplied December financials to Compensation and can supply them to the appropriate RAC individual.  By copy of this email to Rick Buy, I am asking who in RAC is available to review the financials.  Have you spoken to anyone in RAC about this project?  

The Development Team had, at the time (21/2 years ago), the requirement to go to RAC for project approval. The Asset Management Co. has a "valuation" team that is constantly reviewing Proformas for all the assets and my understanding is that they work closely with RAC guidelines. 

I think the process will entail:
1.	Sign off by RAC.
2.	Sign off by Jim Hughes and Stan Horton.
3.	Sign off by Compensation Committee.
4.	Sign off by Creditor Committee and possibly E&Y even though these are bonuses associated with non-debtor entity.

Thanks for your help.

Rick,

It was good running into you last week.  I am currently looking for new
opportunities.  In the last 18 months, I have been working on eCommerce,
specifically B2B exchanges and enterprise portals.  I understand that
Enron has several initiatives in this area.  I was hoping you could give
me some direction.  Attached is my resume.  

 <<BV Resume.doc>> 

Hope all is well,

Probably agree.  I actually had lunch with this guy about six months ago regarding his developing a Credit Derivative business.  He does not seem to be very transactional focus which is what we need.

The plan right now is for us to go regardless of weather.  However, I would leave it up to each individual to decide if they want to participate.  Let me know if you have any other questions.

Becky - you may want to send out one more reminder to your people.  You can copy all of the names from excel and paste into the TO: spot in Outlook.

Some of my brother's salespeople had a very bad night
in a Houston hotel.

This is one of the greatest complaints that I've ever seen.

Rick,

I agree with Rick that three categories are sufficient--if the issues are substantive, they should either result in an increase in the capital price and a "Return below Capital Price" or a "Do Not Proceed" recommendation.  "Other RAC Comments" should highlight any issues succinctly, but are not a substitute for a recommendation and should be read irrespective of being highlighted on the cover page of the DASH.

Regards,

Dave

Subject:	DASH Classification - "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments"

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.     
							Regards!

Kevin,

I thought we agreed to take these reserves since EOL lacks the pricing capability for longer dated transactions.  If you want we can restrict trading to 36 months on EOL and approve long-dated transactions on a one-off basis to insure our counterparty positions remain somewhat balanced.

Please advise,
Bill

You and I had agreed to the structure below for '04 and '05 transactions.  We are not taking credit reserves to the extent the trades are offsetting.  Since '04 is rolling off shortly, we should review the EOL needs for East Power and again come to agreement on the pricing structure.  Let me know when you would like to do so.

Hi Holly,

We have a request that must be done today - as soon as possible.  ECN 2886 is a fileroom that has restricted access.  For security purposes, as of today, only the following are allowed access:

Kortney Brown
Rick Carson
Veronica Gonzalez
David Gorte
Bjorn Hagelmann
Karen Heathman
Rita Hennessey
Donna Lowry
Tom Moran
Sharon Sullo
Jane Wilhite

Please call me as soon as possible to discuss when this security can be changed.  I will be happy to provide whatever information is necessary.

I appreciate your help,

Sharon Sullo

Would one of you like to discuss Board reporting categories of core vs. under review w/Whalley?  Then advise us as to whether the only commodity groups to be considered core are:

European Gas
UK Power
Continental Power
North American Gas
North American Power
Coal

My understanding per the general guidance of the analyst call earlier this week.

Cassandra.

Cassandra - This is a great idea.  Pls. confirm that Rick is comfortable, and I think it makes sense to run it past Whalley.  If this is a matter of sorting, then I would run it past Greg soon - he is the only one who knows how clear these distinctions are at this time.  If this is a very labor-intensive effort, pls. advise.  Thanks.  Paula

Paula-

I hear on the analyst call this morning that we're segregating our wholesale business into 3 categories 1) core, 2) non-core, and 3) under review.

I believe # 1 and # 3 both impact trading; accordingly, perhaps we should customize our reporting accordingly.  Can you review the list below (an excerpt from Appendix 1 of the Risk Management Policy) and advise as to which category each commodity group fits?  Alternatively we can confirm directly with Whalley.  My understanding was this would be a subject of discussion at the Board meeting, and consequently it might help everyone to be able to see the trading results aggregated that way.

Of course if you prefer not reporting to the Board in these new business categories, please advise.  

Thank you,

Cassandra.

The DPR for 11/30/01 is now complete and has been published to the ERV.

For the last few days, the production of the DPR has been put on hold due to the increased activity around terminations.  Positions and VAR for the DPR will start to be produced for trading day 12/10/01 and we are planning to produce a full DPR (inclusive of P&L) on a weekly basis.

Please call if you have any questions.

Bill,
I think owning the process and being the 'font of knowledge' regarding the =
right and wrong application of these products is THE issue.  We constantly =
get the yadda, yadda..."its insured" or its "secured", or "we only have X$ =
exposure" then it turns out its not.  Groups like Dave Marshall's, Peter Ab=
do, and the legal staff tend to be good sources of ideas and contacts, but =
somehow the responsibility for the decisions seems to fall to RAC.  Ironica=
lly, we currently are the least capitalized to make those kinds of decision=
s.  Classic examples of places we do not have enough credibility are in the=
 history and anecdotes regarding claims made and enforced or not.  Nothing =
like a few war stories that are verifiable by outside sources to strengthen=
 our argument. While your and my instincts would probably suffice for the 8=
0% solution, this seems to be a painful road at Enron, especially when the =
targets are so big.  We need to arm the managers and directors in RAC with =
enough information to be persuasive in steering transactions in one directi=
on or another.

The steel team (Bruce Garner et al) here is considering a credit insurance =

You are correct!  This is not a new issue, but it seems to resurface on a r=
egular basis.  The issue has been pointed out regularly (the first time in =
connection with the license and regularly thereafter) and each time the bus=
iness has said not to worry, if they can't cut a deal with New Power they w=
ill just pay the $1/MW.  EES has assumed it will pay the $1/MW since day on=

Harry and Gloria:

Jim Keller and I have indeed dealt with this issue in the past (it actually=
 came up at the time we were applying for our TX marketer license).=20

 It is my understanding, and Jim, please comment if my information is "stal=

 which allows us to make a payment into the System Benefit Fund.  This appr=

provide service to residentials on our behalf.=20

Ed,

Residential Obligation
Section 39.352(g) of Senate Bill 7 provides that for any REP serving an agg=
regate load in excess of 300 MW, 5% of the load must consist of residential=
 customers. A REP can fulfil this requirement by:
1. Demonstrating that it directly serves residential load amounting to 5% o=
f its total load
2. That another REP serves the residential load on its behalf, or
3. It pays 1 dollar per MWH of required 5% load into the System Benefit Fun=
d.
 EES can fulfil its obligation by entering into an agreement with New Power=
 to serve residential load on its behalf, or can pay the 1$ per MWH penalty=
.
There is an annual compliance reporting requirement and EES can demonstrate=
 compliance if it has an agreement with New Power.

EES Contract,
For price to beat customers, the utilities have by Commission rule, the obl=
igation to allow customers to come and go without restraint for the 5 year =
period conmmencing 1/2/02. The Commission concern may be that Enron will ab=
use this provision by gaming the system. The Enron contracts as currently w=
ritten are within the rules as approved by the Commission. Until the utilit=
ies move to amend the relevant rules, the Commission can only exercise its =
displeasure by appropriate oversight and enforcement to determine what cond=
uct amounts to abuse and gaming. I think it will ultimately be a question o=
f degree and pattern of switching. The onus will be on the affiliated REPs =
to prove abuse and gaming. Fundamentally, it is in the best interest of the=
 market to allow customers to come and go. Customer mobility is the best cu=
stomer protection in a competitive market. Besides, a restraint on customer=
 mobility could have a chilling effect on competition as it will increase c=
ustomer inertia. The Commission will carefully weigh any course of action t=
o insure that they achieve a reasonable balance. For larger than 1MW custom=
ers, they can agree to long term contracts and a restriction on their abili=
ty to come and go.

Please call with any questions,
Gloria

Everyone - =20

I was just informed by EPMI that there may be a requirement for Retail Ener=
gy Providers in ERCOT to serve a certain mix of residential rate class/indu=
strial rate class customers once a certain industrial threshold is crossed =
(300 Mw of industrial rate class load). =20

EWS has not set it itself up to monitor such requirements.  Therefore, I ca=
nnot comment on the accuracy or details of this requirement.  However, it i=
s something we definitely need to look into.  In addition, we (EPMI/EWS) ar=
e getting feedback from the TX PUC that they are not pleased with how they =
see the pilot and the market structure unfolding.  Specifically, they are n=
ot pleased with retail energy providers' contracts that contemplate the rig=
ht to switch between direct access and tariff (and visa-versa).  We will mo=
nitor and need to get more clarity on how the PUC intends to address their =
displeasure.

On the residential requirement front, someone needs to address this.  Speci=
fically, is this true.  If so, what rate classes are considered industrial =
vs. commercial?  Is there a similar requirement for commercial load?  Is TI=
 considered industrial?  Do we already have industrial customers in our por=
tfolio?  Who in EES tracks and monitors issues like these as we enter marke=
ts?

Mike Curry is in the process of tracking this info down from an EPMI perspe=
ctive as they are focusing on more of the pure, large industrial customers.=
  We will share any information Mike receives with the EES group.=20

Attached is a draft of the back-up presentation on the Mill performance for the Finance Committee meeting.  While we believe the numbers are correct, there may be some minor revisions.  These numbers are from acquision through August.  The effect of the Garden State newsprint and ONP swaps is included (energy excluded).  We have also not included any income booked on swaps related to the mills.  We can finalize Monday morning.  Let me know if you have any comments.

You can call Travis Mueller who owns a barber shop around the corner (next to Luther's BBQ) if you want.  He's quick, cheap and good.  His number is 713-650-1960.

I meant to offer the dates of Tuesday, January 22 beginning with the Management Committee meeting and extending to approx. 4:00 p.m.

OR

Thanks.

Dear Rick:

Just a quick followup to my voice mail of earlier this afternoon---

I represent an Executive Search Firm based in Atlanta and have been retained by an international leader in the energy industry to pursue Director-level talent; as it happens, my client has recently indicated an express interest in speaking with you.  Since I'd imagine you've been inundated with calls and e-mails similar to mine, in an effort to eliminate any confusion I should tell you that we tried to contact you yesterday (my associate, Michael Allen, left you a voice mail).

I understand that the environment at Enron must be a challenging one at this point; however, if you're interested in talking/listening and are in a position to take a short break, the President/COO of my client company is in Houston today and is curious as to whether you'd by some remote chance be free this afternoon or evening for a brief chat.  I realize that this is highly unorthodox, but also feel that standing on ceremony is perhaps not always the most prudent approach.

I'll wait to hear from you in regard to your interest level---and if you're not available today (as I'm assuming to be the case), we can obviously reschedule for a time that's a bit more reasonable.  Thanks---

Sincerely,

Marcy Brinegar

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where "name" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any "spaces" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Rick/Dave

Agree with Dave as below

Seems the mindset should be to sell everything. Scott plans to turn Mariner into a GOM Shelf company after he sells off the deepwater.

I don't see why the "Basin" team (who were just put on contract to pursue a Shelf strategy) need an extension. Presumably Mariner isn't going to have a Shelf play going forward (and don't have a Shelf position to preserve).

Rick,

My views are as follows:

- The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of significant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company should also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right to continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research into our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be conducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).

- The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than the Enron package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it may create an issue with the creditors committee for the Enron bankruptcy.

- The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my opinion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in light of the Enron situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

I don't see why the "Basin" team (who were just put on contract to pursue a Shelf strategy) need an extension. Presumably Mariner isn't going to have a Shef play going forward (and don't have a Shelf position to preserve).

As you know, the Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio, Texas.  

This has been an eventful and challenging year for Enron.  Now,  more than ever,  it is fitting to bring Enron's leaders together.  After all, it is up to our management team to lead our company through these challenging times.  Together, we will define Enron's character and determine Enron's destiny.

We have a great program planned for this year's conference.  I'm delighted that General Norman Schwarzkopf will join us as a keynote speaker on leadership.  I'm equally pleased to welcome back Gary Hamel, who will help us process the past year and prepare for future success.  As I've said before, we are a company that continues to look to the future, and there are many exciting things in store for us.

I look forward to seeing you at this very important meeting.

Regards,
Ken Lay

We know you have questions about recent events impacting Enron and our plans for the future.  Ongoing investigations and pending litigation have made it difficult, if not impossible, to share information in a timely manner.  While we can't address certain issues, we can tell you about our initial plans to move Enron forward and emerge from bankruptcy, and we are eager to do that.

We had planned to hold an all-employee meeting tomorrow, January 23, at the Hyatt Regency.  However, we don't want to subject you to the media frenzy that would certainly surround such a meeting, so we've decided to postpone it.  We are currently making arrangements to hold a series of employee meetings within the building to protect your privacy.  We will provide the date and times to you as soon as the logistics for those meetings are finalized.

Prior to the employee meetings, we will provide an overview of Enron's new organizational structure.  You can expect that memo shortly.

 Jon D. Markman =20

 If you go way back, it was 139 years ago next week that Gen. Robert E. Lee=
 and his Confederate troops engaged the Union Army at Antietam, Md., in a b=
attle that turned out to be the single bloodiest day in U.S. history. More =
than 26,000 soldiers from both sides were killed or wounded on that Sept. 1=
7, 1862 -- a figure that will probably be eclipsed by the carnage of Sept. =
11, 2001.  That attack, the first major thrust north by the surprisingly po=
werful Southern rebels, led President Abraham Lincoln to issue his Emancipa=
tion Proclamation * and open a new chapter in American civil and business l=
ife, a new era of liberty for people and markets.  Likewise have most major=
 events in U.S. economic history led to consequences unimagined by key acto=
rs at the time. And so it will probably be with this attack. Sources across=
 the country told me Tuesday that they believe that the unexpected conseque=
nce over the next few days and months could be a stock-market rally led fir=
st by promises by the Federal Reserve to provide all necessary funds to sta=
ggered banks and brokerages and next by vast deficit spending by Congress t=
o shore up the country?s defenses.  Michael Stutzer, professor of finance a=
t the University of Iowa, points out that Tuesday?s events were a civil and=
 emotional crisis, not a financial crisis. An emotional crisis, he said, ca=

*A financial crisis is what happened in Japan, where people learned that no=
t only were all the stocks they held were overvalued but that their governm=

must act to prevent a ?contagion of fear? from spreading and leading people=
 to withdraw money and stop buying things. That would lead to a recession a=
nd thus to a real financial emergency.* =20

A few predictions What are the likely immediate consequences when the U.S. =

that led the United States into war. He forecasts with confidence that the =

of the following trading week to remain unchanged at pre-catastrophe levels=
. *If there is a big opening plunge, I think you?ll see a total recovery ov=
er the next five days,* he said from Manhattan.   Kolton, who was en route =
to a meeting at the World Trade Center when the buildings were hit, said he=
 also believes that the United States does not face a financial crisis just=
 because the buildings that were destroyed stood at the center of U.S. fina=
ncial life. The reason: After the 1993 bombing of the buildings, he says, m=
ost companies spent millions to build disaster recovery systems and back up=
 all their accounting far off site. *We?re going to recover,* he said.  Ste=
ve Milner, managing partner of the worldwide financial planning firm Squar =
Milner in Newport Beach, Calif., said he is most worried about the consumer=

sellers of the recent decline, not buyers. But that could turn around. *Peo=

Hi Rick. Hope your holding up. We are going to have all of the "on-going concern" activities here in the old building on the 30-31-32 floors. We will be splitting the estate infrastructure into two functions: on-going activities (contracts/assets we will continue to serve and perform under) and wind-up/liquidation activities. Jim Fallon will be managing the latter function and I believe he is staying in the new building for now.

We need to ensure that we have the appropriate folks from RAC engaged in the on-going concern function. I'd prefer that we continue to have them located near our floors vs. move to another location (as I hear through the grapevine). Could you suggest the folks that would be available to focus exclusively on on-going concern activities, and do you want them to stay on the 28th floor or move onto 31 with us?

Thanks.

This has been on hold for some time now. We need to increase the l/c to keep our foreign primary casualty coverage in place. The total value of the l/c would be $288,700. It is not much of an increase we need, yet there is zero capacity from the bank to handle our request. Failure to act could send a very negative message to the insurance market if we can't handle this small a request.  Just thought you should be made aware.

Jessie:
Please advise the status as this increase needs to be in place no later than November 10, 2001 or it will jeopardize the insurance coverage for Enron's entities operating in foreign countries. 
 
Thanks,
Paul

I understand the copr need to hold off on all unneccessary requests for L/C's or funding. We need to be careful not to jeopordize our insurance coverage. The small amout of the L/C coverage increase keeps in place valuable insurance cover. Please confirm with Jim or Paul what the urgency is to ensure we maintain cover. If it needs Global Finace approvale as well, we can askk for it.
 
Thanks.

We currently are hold with Standard Charter and can not process this request.  I will check with them next week to see where Enron stands.
 
Also, keep in mind, I would need VP approval or above for any changes requested.  Please have someone forward their approval to me on your request.

The subject LOC #S9703509 issued to ACE-INA Overseas Insurance Company, Ltd., and ACE American Insurance Company in the amount of $122,500 needs to be increased to indicate a new LOC amount of $288,700. 
 
Please amend accordingly and let me know should you have any questions.

Bill,

Thought you would find this interesting:

``We continue to trade with them (Enron),'' said spokeswoman Jennifer Pierce of Charlotte-based utility Duke Energy Corp. (NYSE:DUK - news).
 ``They've always been meticulous in their credit management and we continue to see that with them,'' she added.

Jim Reilly said he had spoken to you recently after he saw me holding a sign
under an I10 overpass.  Would love to get together with you to catch up and
figure out what's going on at Enron and elsewhere.  I have attached my
resume'.  We've all come along way since the BT days.  I'll call you in the
near future to see when we can get together.

Attached, please find our revised presentation for the October 8th Board Meeting.  In addition, I have attached a replacement page for the DASH that Chip Schneider asked to be distributed.  The change is a correction of the mill's power service territory.  The original DASH stated that the mill is in the Entergy service territory - the correct region is SERC.

The Board Resolution has not changed since the Sept 25th Executive Committee presentation.  I believe that Rebecca Carter has the final version.

I currently have the signed DASH and will sending it to RAC to be archived.  

Let me know if you have questions.  - Matt (3-9166)

Significant New Issuance - Commentary:

?=09The emerging markets started the week on an extremely quiet note as inv=
estors awaited more news from Argentina, in particular, on possible IMF sup=
port for the country. The situation started to improve on Tuesday night aft=
er Domingo Cavallo's speech intended to support domestic confidence, in whi=
ch he reiterated that the Argentine government would not default on its deb=
t payments. He also announced some special measures designed to reduce the =
government's debt burden, such as an acceptance of bonds as payment for pas=
t-due taxes and bond coupons for future tax liabilities. This announcement,=
 together with positive clues from the IMF about the possibility of a US$6.=
9bn disbursement to Argentina, helped the market to rally around 2.5 points=
. However, the continued fall of international reserves and private sector =
deposits, evidenced by the latest data release, did not contribute to reviv=
e investor confidence and pulled the market down by around 1 point. In Turk=
ey, the week was fairly busy with prices rising on the back of the successf=
ul T-Bill auction and as a result of a technical short squeeze. Real money =
accounts and local banks were active buyers of Turkish bonds helping the Tu=
rkey 2030 benchmark to break through an important resistance level of 80. R=
ussian market activity picked up on the positive news from Argentina, but t=
he rally was not sustained and Russian bonds closed almost unchanged on the=
 week. Central and Eastern European assets had a positive week gaining arou=
nd 0.25-0.50 points in price. Overall, the general sentiment in the emergin=
g debt markets has improved but is still very much subject to stabilisation=
 in Argentina. The EMBI+ Index tightened around 20 bps on the week to at +8=
96 bps level on Friday.
?=09The United Mexican States (Baa3/BB+) placed a US$1.5 bn 8.30% issue due=
 08/2031 on Monday. The bond was priced at a spread of +335 bps over Treasu=
ries. The fact that a Latin American issuer was able to successfully place =
such a large transaction is a good sign that the impact of the Argentine cr=
isis is limited and has not shut down the primary market for borrowers.
?=09The Republic of Latvia's (Baa2/BBB) credit rating outlook was raised by=
 Standard & Poors from "Stable" to "Positive" reflecting an improved spendi=
ng control and better perspective for GDP growth.

Personal & Confidential

Gentlemen:

Attached are NPW drafts of the Form 8-K and Press Release.

Marc Manly called this evening to indicate that he will try to get Business Review Committee (BRC) sign-off on the Transaction by the end of the day tomorrow (hopefully earlier), followed by a short NPW Board meeting or, in lieu thereof, the circulation of a Unanimous Written Consent.  I questioned whether the Enron directors should recuse themselves from the Board meeting ( I believe they should do so, although they could be present for quorum purposes) and how any recusal would affect a Consent (in lieu of a Board meeting).  Joe, do you have any thoughts here, given the circumstances.  In addition, Marc and I have signed-off on the BRC resolutions (which are being circulated for execution), and I will review tonight the latest draft of the Board resolutions that I just received.

I am providing a copy of this E-Mail to Mark Koenig for his information from an Enron IR perspective.

Regards,
Robert

Robert:

     I attach the current versions of a form 8-K and associated press
release, assuming the Business Review Committee and the Board approve the
transactions.  Gene is reviewing these documents and may have additional
comments.  Please provide any comments and I will recirculate another draft
reflecting all comments received.  As indicated in the 8-K, we would intend
to include the press release as a filed exhibit to the 8-K.

     We are attempting to finalize the underlying deal documents tonight so
that they may be submitted to the BRC.  Unless there is a problem with
using resolutions by unanimous consent (e.g., the Enron directors must
recuse themselves and thus the resolutions can only pass by means of a live
board meeting), we are tending toward board action by unanimous consent.
We will explore if that is a problem, and if so, will call a telephonic
meeting at the earliest time we can obtain a quorum.

                                   Marc

Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX payment performance?????

Rod, Stan and Rick,

Pursuant to your request, I have visited PGE last week and had conversations with the respective PGE employees. Below are my conclusions and analysis.

In Retrospect (Jan-01 - Sep-01)

Background
During this period PGE has negotiated a Power Cost Adjustment (PCA) mechanism that limits PGE risks and rewards. According to this mechanism, PGE is responsible for only 10% of the costs in excess of $232.5 MM. Earlier in the year, PGE has accumulated the length for the 2001-2002 period that appreciated in value significantly as prices were increasing. Since liquidations on the hedges are included in the power costs, this value has offset the company's power costs and pushed the total cost of power in the deadband, where PGE wears 100% of risks and rewards.

Earnings Impact
As prices continued to decline against the long position, PGE incurred significant power costs from its hedge liquidations and moved through the deadband, where the Company wears 100% of the downside.

Other items that impacted earning included:
	- reduced load during the period
	- reserves for CA receivables
	- losses in spec trading

For the remainder of the PCA, through the end of Sep-01, PGE is only responsible for 10% of the incurred power costs.

Analysis
In my opinion, the following factors have affected PGE's decision to maintain the length in a bearish market:

	- bullish or not as bearish sentiment among traders
	- reliability issues: PGE has significant political and financial repercussions for being caught short in a blackout
	- psychological fears of tight power supplies and potential blackouts/brownouts, mainly because of recent situation in CA

Next 15 Months (Oct-01 - Dec-02)

PGE has agreed to implement a similar PCA mechanism for the next 15 months. Below are the highlights:
	
- PGE is currently negotiating the base cost level with the PUC. This is a critical step to ensure that PGE's estimate of the 15-months baseline power costs, as agreed with 	the PUC, is equal to or greater than the actual costs for the period (~$984 MM)
- the new PCA provides for tighter bands (+/- $28 MM for 100% exposure)
- transmission costs, resulting from load variations are not factored into the PCA mechanism
- Given tighter bands, PGE will begin to place greater emphasis on the spec book - MTM earnings

Beyond 2002

PGE is naturally short beyond 2002 (load exceeds generation and hedges). PGE could begin discussions with the PUC on the structure of a new PCA mechanism to limit their risk and rewards; or move towards greater deregulation. There is a possibility that PGE will loose some of its industrial commercial load during this time period, with an obligation to take them back at a standard offer.

In the meantime, the Company began purchasing power for the 2003-2004 time period to cover residential load.

Recommendations/Action Steps

1. Design decision authority process for significant business decisions. In retrospect, it would be helpful to analyze the value of the long position against the cost of reliability and make a decision accordingly. Other examples: should PGE apply for a PCA mechanism past 2002, should PGE be purchasing power for 2003-2004. Also, participate regularly in the PGE Risk Management Committee meetings.

2. Continue to improve trading controls (missed a deal earlier in the year resulting in a $10 MM loss in the spec book). Significant improvements have been made since then.
	- move settlements function under middle office to ensure segregation of duties - currently reports through the commercial function
	- capture option exposure ASAP or prohibit option trading: PGE has an option trade in the books that is not captured in the risk management and reporting 			framework (position, P&L and VaR)
	- develop processes for capturing other exposures:
		Interest rates, embedded in commodity cash flows and assets
		Foreign currency, resulting from transactions with Canadian counterparties in CAD$
		Heating Oil #2, PGE has ~ 1 MM Bbls in storage at the Beaver Plant
		Coal, two-year contract for supply of coal to the Boardman Plant

3. Daily reporting of PGE risks: VaR, Positions and P&L, notifications of limit violations; as well as, notification of important transactions (purchase of 2003-2004 power)

4. Input/coordination with EWS on important trading decisions. Insights from the West Desk could help PGE make better trading decisions.

5. Periodic review of trading controls - add PGE to the list of Doorstep projects.

I would be glad to provide additional details. Vlady.

Yesterday, Enron settled a procedural dispute with Dynegy over Northern Natural Gas.  Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan

Rick,

One thought to absorb some of the budget would be to purchase Blackberry mobile devices for some of the RAC staff.  With many of the business units migrating to the new building, it is likely to be beneficial to have continuous e-mail access when Underwriters and others in the group are away from the floor.  The cost of the units, which seem to be the technology of choice, is about $300 apiece; monthly charges are about $30.

Please let me know your opinion.

Regards,

Dave

var in john's booked dropped by $8MM but the var on the gas desk went up by $12MM - volatility increased also 2%
most of the reduction was in cal 03 where we don't have much risk anyway - hence not much change
there is nothing wrong with the model

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Kathy,
It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

6.	What is the sensitivity analysis of the trading portfolios from a liquidity and margining requirement standpoint based upon i) two standard deviations in the relevant underlying commodity price both upward and downward, ii) a one notch credit downgrade by S&P, in addition to the action already taken by Moody's and Fitch, and iii) a combination of the two scenarios? (BNP)  What is the availability of sufficient liquidity to accommodate such scenarios? (BNP)

Ben,
I met with Rick Buy and several members of his group last week to discuss the buyout and what the remaining exposures to Enron were.  As the Raptor DPR's were generally taking hedged values directly from ENA's MPR, they were going to discuss the valuation on those assets with Dick Lydecker.  I haven't heard anything else from RAC since that meeting.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to further this process.  Thanks,
Ron

Please work with RAC (Dave Gorte) to ensure that all of the Raptor Investments are being monitored.

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

Subject:	Memo to RAC

I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

Rick

Heart disease is the number one killer, but great strides have been made in the last fifty years.  Dr. DeBakey designed the first revolutionary procedure on his wife's sewing machine, and today, right on CNN, we can see the first human walking around with a completely artificial heart.  Many of you know someone who wouldn't be here without these advancements in medical technology.  

On Saturday, November 3, Enron and other companies will be joining the American Heart Association for the Heart Walk.  The Houston Heart Walk is targeting over $750,000 for continuing the fight against heart disease and for rebuilding the many years of research that were lost as a result of this year's floods.  

We are looking for 50 team captains.  The primary role of a team captain is to recruit approximately ten walkers.  The walkers can be friends, family, business associates outside Enron, or co-workers.  The walkers, in turn, solicit sponsors for the walk.  As a team captain, you may also walk, of course, and Enron's top walker (from a fundraising perspective) is eligible for two free airline tickets.  Additional incentives are currently being developed.

If you are willing to serve as a team captain or a walker, please email or call Sue Wadsworth (713-853-5105) or Melissa Becker (713-853-6641).  We look forward to seeing you November 3 and demonstrating Enron's commitment to fighting heart disease.

If we have the flexibility to afford a potential significant acceleration of NewPower losses/liquidity issues ie) going to zero and we feel we have our trade credit adequately secured then the right call is probably to abandon the seats.   Mark what is your view?

We are working hard to address the immediate New Power exposure.  Dave:  FYI it might actually involve Service Co. Mark, we are talking to Jimmie this morning on that idea. We will certainly review overall exposure as a part of this.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

Please see attached updated turbine report.  The previous report incorrected overstated the contract cost of the Arcos turbines.  Please note that only one Arcos turbine is shipboard and that the remaining two are still in fabrication.

Rick, 

Our group has completed our new investment strategy and are preparing to move into the execution phase.  I would appreciate the opportunity to present the strategy to you, Dave Gorte and Randy Petersen.  It would take about 1 hour, and I would value your feedback.  Let me know if you are up for it, and I will have my assistant schedule it.

Thanks, 
KG

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol "ENRNQ."  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC "Pink Sheets."

Dear Rick,

I quickly wanted to send you my new contact information as well as ask you
about my Cash Balance Plan.  My fifth anniversary with Enron is coming up
this Sunday, December 9.

The Cash Balance Plan vests after five years and I want to make sure that
HR's comments to me regarding the plan are right.  HR (Sheila Walton) told
me last week that I need not to worry about vesting in the plan since we
will officially still be Enron employees as long as we are getting paid
severance.  With the latest information we got this seems to be questionable
now.  HR and Benefits do not seem to know what is going on now; all my
questions remained unanswered when I called them this morning.  Benefits
stated that as long as my termination date was after the 9th of December I
would vest.  HR doesn't seem to know when my official termination date is.
If needed, I have more than 10 days of unused vacation; I could be deemed on
vacation and terminated after the 9th.

I would like to ask you to help me with this matter and try to set my
termination date after December 9, i.e. at the earliest next Monday.  I feel
that the company has left us with absolutely nothing but an extreme lack of
information and loads of unanswered questions. I do not see myself in a
position where I want to give my Cash Balance Plan up.

My contact information is:

Thanks again for all your efforts, I really enjoyed my time in RAC, and you
were right, I did learn many useful tools for my future endeavors.

Best regards,

Carol North

Attached is the draft presentation of the internal controls component of the audit.  We are only planning on including the first 4 of 8 pages.   The last 4 pages were built anticipating Andersen being involved and are included here for reference only.

Page 4 is the RAC component.

Attached is a memo I prepared for Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes regarding FERC's investigation into potential refunds for Pacific Northwest spot sales.  I'm circulating the memo in anticipation of questions during the conference call tomorrow.  Gary Fergus and/or Dan Watkiss will likely have further observations.

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

I want to thank everyone for their hard work during these trying times. Lots of our efforts in the past building systems, procedures and infrastructure pay off in times like these. Feedback from both Citibank and JPM/Chase and Enron's Board members has been very positive relative to RAC. Congratulations to all.

On another note I want to caution everyone in the group from making negative statements in the presence of ours and other groups, especially more junior members of these groups. Because they come from RAC they are not considered idle commentary and can be, and have been, damaging to morale to these people. We all speculate about the state of affairs and it is a good stress relief but we can not be a part of morale reducing behavior.

Things are not back to normal but they are improving. Upon receipt of commitment from banks, hopefully later today or early tomorrow, our short term issues should be resolved. Lots of activities are underway to address medium term and long term solutions. In the mean time, keep smiling.

Rick

Rick - 
I am seeking to help a friend-of-a-friend who has squamous cell carcinoma in his nasal passage.  It sounds familiar - is it the same as your diagnosis in a different location?   If not, pls. ignore.   If so, who do you see at MD Anderson as your primary doctor? Thanks for your help.  
Separately, I hope you are doing very well.  I am forwarding info about an amazing conference put on by the Anderson Network.  I have been active for some years, and my husband and I are sponsoring the closing speaker, Ron Bliss (cancer survivor and 6 1/2 year VietNam POW).   It would entail a day off, but is extremely worthwhile.  See attached webpage (note "Living Fully with Cancer" conference on right hand of 1st page).  
I look forward to hearing from you.  Take care, Paula

Rick Buy had a conversation with Pug Winokur yesterday in which Pug requested that a change in the Transaction Approval Process be effected immediately so that all divestitures in excess of $50 million be presented to the Board for its approval.    This change means that this transaction will need to go the the Board.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

Dash was signed back in October and we determined that board approval was not needed.  Buy and Pug said that non-core assets less than $500 million did not need board approval.  The document has been signed and we do not have an out for our board.

FYI - per Rod Hayslett and Stan Horton, Ken Lay and Skilling were recently "shocked" to be told that PGE's regulated price risk management activities were going to lose ~$53MM in the 3rd quarter.  Rod said they hadn't realized before this the level of market risk that PGE is exposed to.  Evidently PGE is required to have excess supply to meet their projected load requirements, and they're losing $$ on price moves.  Rod said Stan suggested having a conference call with Rick Buy to discuss, so I told Rod to first let you get familiar with the issue.  

You'll probably want to be familiar with it since we're recommending a $10MM limit on the Regulated Portfolio, and it's losing $$$.  We're simply imposing a limit on existing risk, but given the significant drop in PGE earnings vs. prior year, Investor Relations is expecting some interest and the BOD might be aware of it and ask for clarification of our risk management practices accordingly.

Regards,
Cassandra.


PGE 3Q IBIT/Sensitivity to power prices

INTERNAL SUMMARY
?	PGE buys power in advance of its needs to allow for load and reliability balancing beyond their generation capabilities.  PG&E is typically long 200-300 average megawatts.  These positions are typically entered into 1 to 2 years in advance.  The excess positions are sold in the spot (hourly) market.
?	PGE benefited during the 3rd and 4th quarters 2000 by selling into high prices.  As a precaution against prices falling, they instituted a cost adjustment mechanism with ranges for cost sharing based on total power costs.  In 2Q01, PGE entered an unfavorable range of the sharing mechanism, where they bear 100% of the upside/downside within a range.  As a result of downward trending power pricing and the cost of power outpacing the sharing under the arrangement, PGE IBIT may be flat/slightly negative for 3Q01.
?	On 10/1/01, a new cost mechanism begins.  PGE expects to meet internal target of $110M for 2001, based on YTD performance and additional adjustment mechanisms, which are being executed for 4Q01 and into 2002.

BACKGROUND
?	The methodology for the current 9-month mechanism is as follows:
o	A band with a ceiling and a floor has been negotiated on a quarterly and a cumulative basis for the nine-month period.
     Total Costs			PGE/Customer
$140M to $211M 			100% PGE (deadband)
      $211M to $232M 			50%/50% 
      Above $232M			10%/90%
?	At 6/30/01, PGE was in the 100% PGE band, ($105M), but did not significantly impact the financials as this amount was sufficient to cover power generation costs.)
?	It is expected that the 9 mo. total costs will rise to $325M, which will potentially expose PGE for approx. $35MM (comprised of 100% of the risk of the deadband to the extent that total costs to be recovered are lower than increases in the costs of power, 50% of the risk between $211MM to $232MM and 10% of exposure above $232MM.)
?	To reduce the exposure for fourth quarter 2001 and 2002, PG&E is in the process of finalizing a similar cost adjustment mechanism for a 15-month period ending December 31, 2002.  The structure mechanism will have additional features:
o	A tighter band than the 2001 mechanism
o	Tiers of sharing, with less sharing as the variance between forecasted power costs and actual power costs is larger, positive or negative.
o	Forecasted power costs set using actual reservoir levels, and expected rainfall, significantly reducing forecasted available hydro
o	PG&E will file the forecasted power costs on or around August 15, reflecting trades and purchases through the end of July

This will help enlighten you as to what Portland can look like.

The attached was prepared by Amin Maredia last week, as we were getting up-to-speed on PGE's cost sharing mechanism and a potential drop in 3Q earnings.  This document is for your education only - obviously, we will learn more as the 3Q numbers begin shaping up.

Everyone, J.C. asked me to send the following message:

Yesterday, the Houston federal court (U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas) entered an Order consolidating all cases "involving or related to the financial difficulties of Enron" before one Judge, Lee Rosenthal (who was the Judge to whom the earliest-filed case had been assigned and who conducted the hearing last Friday). The consolidation order grants a motion that we and other defense counsel had made. It means that all cases in the Houston federal court should proceed in a more orderly, coordinated fashion.

A technical detail - the Order provides for three separate consolidated proceedings before Judge Rosenthal: (i) the federal securities cases; (ii) the derivative cases (at least those that have been filed in federal court); and (iii) the employee benefit plan cases.

Finally, the Order allows parties ten days to file objections to consolidation. While someone may well file an objection, we cannot think of any meritorious grounds for an objection.

As always, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call us.

Terri Richardson
Assistant to J.C. Nickens

Subject:	Headcount

Michael,
I wanted to give you an update on the personnel front given that things are moving fairly fast and I want to make sure that I am keeping up with the evolution of your and John's thinking about resources.


Our original 2001 budget (adjusted) had 52 heads
We have frozen the number at 44 which represents the people who are here (39) and those we have agreed to bring on board (5).
We expect to drop up to  6 full time from the redundancy process - manager, 4 specialists, associate.
 we plan to send one manager to Houston, and delay one arrival so that there is less overlap with Rod Nelson (expected departure 6/30/02)
one employee would like to go part-time at beginning next year and I believe that she can be very productive in doing so.
 we plan to use this process to drop one manager in Australia.
I am planning to take on 2 (director, sr specialist) from other EEL units into London-RAC - est 50/50 EEL/non-EEL
Also, one EEL-London employee (non-RAC) to relocate to Australia to replace person dropped in Australia.

Numerically, it looks like this:

Original  Budget - 2001				52
Current Headcount				44
 Net of Original Budget (%)			8 (18%)

New (adjusted) Budget						44

Redundant				(6)
Delay					(1)
Re-deploy to Houston			(1)
Part - time				(.5)
	reductions					(8.5)	
	sub-total						35.5

Add
	EBS Director			1
	Enron Credit Sr Spec		1
   additions						2	
New Total							37.5			
	net % change	(from original 2001 budget)		(28%)
	net % change	(from adjusted 2002 budget)		(15%)

The 1 addition and 1 subtraction in Australia will run through the Houston Credit budget with an allocation back to Australia electricity 50% and Global Markets 50%
and represent a wash as regards headcount.

I would like to consider adding people up to the New (adjusted) Budget -44 -after the dust clears.  There are some internal people who have expressed some interest and a few candidates we have gotten close on that might be good candidates to replace the ones made redundant.  I am not asking for approval to do this. I will do so on a case-by-case basis after things settle out.

Let me know what you think.
Ted

I would see the primary responsibilities:


1. Develop with Fallon a written process for the valuation of terminated contracts.  We will most likely only have Bjorn for a short period of time given his reluctance to go to NETCO.  While no one appears to care about the fact that we have no way to render a correct value for financial statement purposes, this would be a priority if I was managing the estate.   There is no metric for the approval of comprises internally.  Our curves say one value, the counterparties quotes say another.  Differences in value may be a better metric that notional settlement amounts.
2. With IT, assure that the terminated contracts are frozen in value.   The book is currently floating, rendering an open position which is unmeasured as to VaR.  Examine ways, if any, to manage this uncovered market risk. 
3. Valuation of assets held for sale and DASH process.   It would appear that we should work backwards from the summary of sale that the Unsecured Creditors Committee wants.   There have already been complaints about multiple forms (DASH, transaction review committee for).  This would require revamping the DASH process and TAP.   
4. Revaluation of International assets.
5. To the extent EES performs post petition, value this book and the associated  ongoing costs associated with it.
6. My understanding is that the billing on performing accounts is behind. Manage and develop a process to collect these past due amounts.  Collectibility does not improve with time.
7. Ongoing review of business unit's cash requests.
8. Develop a systematized IT solution to payments and transfers made 90 days prior to bankruptcy (in process).
9. Manage the bankrupt counterparty portfolio.
10. Collect amounts owed by PG&E and So Cal Edison ($545 million notional).
11. Maintain a pipeline report.

Natural Gas & Power
Catalysts In Place, EPG Up 8%, ENE Poised to Recover, Group Positioning Solid

Summary

Group led by El Paso (EPG, 51.02, Strong Buy), up 8% on positive meetings,
discussion of regulatory risks and increase in "hedged" production. Storage
revision moves Sept natural gas price down 20% and E&P shares 7% lower. IPP's
rise 4% in recovery from recent weakness.

Natural Gas & Power "majors" up nearly 3% vs 2% rise in S&P 500. EPG gain plus
3% upside moves in Dynegy (DYN, 42.25, Buy) and Williams (WMB, 32.81, Buy).
Kinder Morgan (KMI, 55.71, Strong Buy) up 2% for week and 7% y-t-d as best
performer in group. Duke (DUK, 38.75, Strong Buy) up 2%.

Enron (ENE, 36.35, Strong Buy) off 1% for week. At 20x '01 eps est of $1.80 and
16.2x '02 est of $2.25, ENE is trading at average p/e of group and 15%-20% less
than overall market. Premium growth rate above 20%, dissipation of recent
concerns, positive group and company fundamentals point to recovery.

"Cheap growth" aspect of sector valuations identified in 20% discount to S&P p/e
despite premium growth rate. Catalysts in 3Q'01 eps up 20% despite lower
yr-over-yr commodity prices, stable to higher sequential commodity prices and
some improvement in regulatory environment.

Viewpoint

Despite a significant drop of nearly 20% in the September '01 natural gas
futures related to a storage reporting "snafu" that moved exploration and
production shares 7% lower, the natural gas and power group, led by a nearly 8%
gain in EPG rose about 2%, in line with the S&P 500. Stronger performance,
reversing declines by Independent Power Producers (up 4% last week) helped DYN
and WMB rise about 3% each. In terms of natural gas prices, our focus remains on
longer term supply and demand fundamentals that point to a sustainable range of
$3-$4 per mcf. We consider this range as beneficial for the merchant, pipeline
and producing sectors of the industry.

We have previously commented on the "cheap growth" attraction of the Natural Gas
& Power group compared to the overall market. An earnings growth rate in excess
of 15% and a price/earnings multiple about 20% below the S&P 500 currently are
the valuation criteria that summarize this opportunity currently.

In our opinion, the shares that best fit this investment model currently are EPG
at 13.4x '02 eps (discussed below) and WMB, at 12.2x '02 eps. We also emphasize
ENE at 16.2x '02 because its premium p/e is gone, but its premium growth rate
remains. DYN, at 17.2x '02 eps and KMI at 23.2x '02 are very attractive
currently as well.

We look for 3Q'01 eps growth above 20% despite lower year-over-year commodity
prices; stable to higher sequential natural gas and power prices; and
improvement in the regulatory environment as catalysts for recovery and upside
for the group..

EPG Analyst Meeting Details Growth; Regulatory Issues

EPG held analyst meetings last week that focused on earnings growth, especially
in its Merchant Energy unit, additional hedging of natural gas production and
the regulatory and legal issues in the FERC "market power" and "marketing
affiliate abuse" cases pending against the company.

In the two cases pending against EPG, new information will be available soon.
Legal briefs were due Fri, Aug 24 and "reply briefs" are due on Sept 7. Rulings
by the FERC Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) are expected "on or before" Oct 9.

Initial comments from the EPG legal briefs substantiate the position that the
company did nothing wrong, has already been exonerated by the FERC in a March
'01 ruling on the affiliate matter and did not have, or exercise, market power.

We anticipate that the legal comments filed by the California Public Utilities
Commission (CPUC) will attempt to sensationalize EPG internal documents that
discuss use of pipeline capacity to manipulate the market. However, this is only
if these documents are taken out of context and without any recognition of the
economic, operational and regulatory realities of the situation.

In our opinion, obvious and prejudicial comments by the ALJ indicate a
probability of the "affiliate case" being ruled against EPG. We regard the
"market power" allegations as clearly unproved.

>From a financial point of view, the significance of this outcome is that the
affiliate case carries no financial penalties and does not open EPG to civil
liability in California. In this event, we would ascribe a possibility to
settlement discussions emanating from the CPUC because they are seeking a
financial windfall, not a technical victory in their case against EPG.

>From a business perspective, EPGs Merchant, Pipeline, Production and Field
Services units producing sustainable and visible eps growth in the 15%-20%
range. Our modeling concurs with these projections.

Our Merchant Energy estimate shows 25% ebit growth, mostly related to non-
commodity based fee and margin business. In Production, EPG has 75% of '01
production hedged at $3.85 per mcf, 60% of '02 hedged at $4.19 per mcf and 35%
of '03 at $4.19 per mcf. Our model shows EPGs leverage to natural gas prices of
about $0.02 per share per $0.10 per mcf change.  At or above a $3.20 realized
gas prices indicates some conservatism in our '02 estimates.

Our estimates remain $3.30 in '01 & $3.80 in '02. We rate EPG Strong Buy and it
is on the CSFB Focus List. We recognize the regulatory issues with an interim
target of 15x our '02 estimate or $57 as the October 9, 2001 ALJ decision
approaches. Our longer-term target, recognizing its premium growth rate is 20x
'02 eps or $76 per share.

ATG Responds to Full Rate Review by PSC

AGL Resources (ATG, 22.81, Hold) plans to ask the Georgia Public Service
Commission (PSC) to reconsider its decision for a full rate review at its gas
utility. The PSC staff said that ATG is earning 4%-7% more than its allowed ROE
of 11%. Approximately $30-52 million pretax, or $0.35- $0.60 per share after-tax
is at stake in this matter. ATG has responded that a rate reduction is unjust
based on its calculation of a 9.9% return.

A PSC ruling is expected in March '02. We are maintaining our current estimates,
albeit with a higher level of uncertainty with the outcome of the rate case. Our
eps estimates are $1.55 in '01 and $1.60 in '02. Our valuation thesis for ATG
points to its dividend yield of 4.7% and a p/e target of 15x '02 eps. Currently
this derives a target price of $24 and a Hold rating. Please see report dated
July 26, 2001 for additional information.

AGA Revises Natural Gas Storage Number Upward

September natural gas prices fell 18% last week after the American Gas
Association (AGA) revised its 3 billion cubic feet injection report to 50 bcf
for the week ended August 10, 2001. While reporting an injection of 86 billion
cubic feet for the week ending August 17th, the AGA restated the storage
injection for the week ending August 10th from 3 bcf to 50 bcf injection. Many
market participants expressed concern with the initial 3 bcf storage number
which the AGA had previously stated would not be revised. Please see page 13 for
more details and historical natural gas storage information.

UGI Closes Propane Acquisition from NI

UGI Corp's (UGI, 29.09, Buy) 52% owned propane subsidiary Amerigas propane (APU,
23.50, Buy) announced the completion of its acquisition of Columbia Propane from
NiSource (NI, 26.22, Buy) for $202 million last week. The transaction includes
the issuance of 2.3 million APG units to NI.  Our analysis shows an addition of
$0.10 per share in earnings in '02 for UGI (and a plus in a completed assety
sale for NI). We are maintaining our '01 eps estimate of $2.05 in '01 and
raising our '02 eps estimate from $2.25 to $2.35 in '02 for UGI.

Industry Fundamentals

Pricing

Our index of natural gas prices for 2001 closed August 24 at $4.85 per mcf, down
$0.18 for the week and $1.01 above the same week in 2000. The near-month
September contract closed at $2.71 per mcf, down $0.60 from the week before. Our
index for 2002 closed at $3.26, down $0.40 from the previous week.

The "12-month strip" closed the week at $3.21 per mcf, off $0.46 for the week
and $0.43 lower than the comparable week a year ago.

The near-month (October) futures contract for West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
closed at $26.93 per barrel, up $0.30 for the week. This compares with $32.03 a
year ago. The September futures contract expires August 21 at $27.91.

Nuclear plant outages stand at 6% of total nuclear generating capacity versus 7%
a year ago.

The information consists of a letter which provides details of account balance(s) by plan, life-to-date contributions under most plans, general Q&A's regarding top hat non-qualified deferral plans, the process for preserving a claim with the bankruptcy court and a sample claim form.  We have received many calls and think that this will answer most questions.  Any additional questions regarding deferrals may be forwarded to executive.compensation@enron.com, voice mail 713-345-7960, or to P. O. Box 1188 in care of the Deferral Plan Administration group for a written response.  

We will continue to work with Weil, Gotshal, and Manges LLP to exhaust any reasonable effort as it relates to making payments to the participants of Enron's deferral plans.  

If you have questions, please call me at x35816.

Now that there is a more concerted investigation going on, including numerous FBI agents in town seeking interviews, it is perhaps prudent to remind you that before talking to the FBI or any other investigator, you contact us.

OK- here is my view. I believe the Bod approved a policy that had discretionary var in it even if the one presented did not. We need to modify the policy to include dis. var and have it be $50MM. I believe we can take extreme liberty here given the situation. We can clean everything up after next meeting. Poetic license from the poets. Please confirm to me you got this message as electrons flow a little more slowly up here (as does everything else). Rick

Rick 

1       Limits. Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals: 

The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR. So here's what I did:

Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's "Big Buckets" are now as follows: 

US Gas                          $100MM 
US Elec                         $100MM 
Europe Gas & Elec                       $35MM 
Global Products                 $20MM 
Financials                              $15MM 
Emerging Businesses             $20MM 

If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation). 

At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows:

Enron Americas                          $82MM 
EWS OOC (aka George Martingale) $3MM 
EEL                                     $34MM 
EGM                                     $23MM 
EIM                                     $8MM 
EBS                                     $4MM 
PGE                                     $4MM 
ETS                                     $1MM 

Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g. gas = $61MM as before). So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the "Big Buckets" and the Business Units.

I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know. I said I would come back on that. I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?).

Cleared it with Whalley today (he laughed), mentioned the dwindling membership of the Risk Management Committee and said "In my current role I think I should be asking for limits, not approving them"

...and then... 

2       The gas desk lost $98MM yesterday 

A combination of a very bullish AGA number (3 Bcf injection - not a typo - three Bcf !) plus some hurricane activity in the gulf sent prices up by between 25 and 30c all across the strip. The long and the short of it was we are long Nov - Jan but short (big-time) out beyond that - the rest is arithmetic.

So we have two flavors of P&L notification, one at the business unit level (Americas) $89MM loss against VaR limit of $82MM; the other as a commodity, losing $126MM (the desk aren't the only ones with a gas position, as usual) against the Big Bucket number of $100MM. Total trading was a loss of $106MM against a VaR limit of $150MM so no calls to Pug required (thank goodness).

That's it for now, hope you're having fun and remember: pan-fry the big ones and throw back the little ones.

Rick,  as a followup to our conversation about a month ago I just want to summarize where we are on the sale of EOGIL and the steps we are taking for corporate approvals as we move toward closing.   We are currently anticipating project close on July 27th, but as with all things associated with India the date will probably slide some.  Here'e what we are planning to do for Corp approval.  1) Steve Harper is working with Brad Larson to get a RAC document completed along the lines of the package we prepared for the China sale last month. This should be completed early next week and either your group or Steve will get it circulated for sign-offs.  2) We (Detmering/Sherrick) will review the project with Skilling/Lay prior to Rac sign-off.  

Based on our last discussion, we will not need board approval for this sale since it is less than $500 million.  If this is not correct, let me know ASAP.  Otherwise, we will do the above and plan to close on July 27th.

Thanks
jeff

Enron Principal Investments (EPI), which was formed in the 2nd quarter, has completed its integration and the development of its new strategy.  This group will be responsible for identifying, closing, managing and exiting all non-E&P equity investments for Enron worldwide.  Kevin Garland will lead EPI, which includes Barbara Paige, Andrew Marsden, Kevin Kuykendall, Steven Sheldon, Michele Nezi Marvin and Mark Gandy.  Additionally, Dick Lydecker and the Special Asset Group will continue to report to Kevin.

EPI will pursue investments related to Enron's core businesses, where Enron has a unique insight into the market, company or technology.  Initially, this will be geographically focused in North America and Europe.  This group will rely heavily on the support and cooperation of the core business units to provide information and market insight.  

EPI may make investments in the form of venture capital, leverage buyouts, growth equity, or private equity in public companies.  The group will not make investments in seed stage companies, other funds, subsidiaries of larger corporations, or project equity.

Please join me in supporting the efforts of Enron Principal Investments.

Please let us know if you have anyone available. My understanding is if we have to got to the outside it will cost us $200 per hour, per person. We appreciate your support.

	The Corporate Development group is in need of extra people (with some free time on their hands) to assist in manning 3 data rooms that are being set up for the

	the business, just capable of watching the area and ensuring that Enron's property is securely maintained.  The hours are 8am to 8pm and we are slotting

Help yourself.  I would not recommend using the numbers that you and David are trying to use.  They are out of a table in ERMS that has no relevance to how the books are calculted.  Unless of course,  you and David know something that I don't and you guys want to start running p&l's .  Please make sure you run by John anything that you plan on giving anyone.

Thanks

I can't believe you finally got Vlady. You must have snuck in while I was on vacation. 

By the way, Whalley, Port and I talked and decided we would try removing all your limits except var. Lets see how it works.

Today, we are forming Enron Global Services (EGS) in order to more closely align our asset-based businesses.

This reorganization will allow EGS to focus our resources on opportunities that present the highest value to Enron.  It will also accomplish the following:  1) enhanced synergies among our assets and personnel, 2) more effective prioritization of business opportunities, and 3) better management of Enron's asset-based businesses throughout the world.

Enron Global Services' energy asset portfolio includes the North American pipeline businesses of Enron Transportation Services (ETS), including Northern Border; the international pipeline, power and distribution operations of Enron Global Assets & Services (EGAS); Portland General Electric; EOTT Energy Corp; Enron Wind; Azurix and Wessex Water.  

Reporting to me as the heads of their respective business units are:
?	Jim Hughes, President & COO - EGS/International
?	Danny McCarty, Managing Director & CCO - ETS
?	Bill Cordes, President - Northern Border Partners
?	Peggy Fowler, President & CEO - Portland General Electric
?	John Garrison, President & CEO - Azurix
?	Dana Gibbs, President & COO - EOTT Energy Corp
?	Colin Skellett, CEO - Wessex Water
?	Adam Umanoff, President & CEO - Enron Wind

With the creation of EGS, we hope to enhance the efficient utilization of our commercial support services.  To accomplish this, EGS' staff and operational functions will be headed by:
?	Rod Hayslett, Managing Director & CFO 
?	Rob Walls, Managing Director & General Counsel 
?	Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Pipeline Operations and Engineering & Construction
?	Brian Stanley, President & CEO - EEOS
?	Steve Hotte, Vice President & CIO
?	John Ambler, Vice President, Communications & PR	
?	Gary Smith, Vice President, Human Resources

In addition, Rob Walls will continue to perform his role as Deputy General Counsel for Enron reporting to Jim Derrick.

Phil Lowry will be responsible for domestic pipeline operations, technical services and engineering & construction, as well as, international pipeline technical services and engineering & construction.  Brian Stanley will be responsible for technical services and engineering & construction for international power and distribution facilities.  

Below is an organization chart for Enron Global Services, which displays the changes described here.  We are confident this new organization will focus our talent and capital appropriately.  Please join me in supporting this management team as it strives to maximize Enron's return on its assets.

I've attached the latest report so you can see how your business unit or functional group is doing. The final push is on.  Wouldn't it be great to get to $2.9M by 5:00 p.m. today!   Please call if I can help you in any way today.  I know we can get there.  Thanks for all of your help, Kathy

Subject: 


By now everyone has been hearing the death toll rise and reports of the destruction from the terrorist attacks on the US. These were deplorable acts that we will never forget. But now is a time to look at the other side of the numbers coming out of New York, Washington and Pennsylvania. 

The sad but somewhat uplifting side that the mainstream media has not reported yet- the SURVIVAL rates and some positive news about the attacks. 

*** The Buildings *** 

* The World Trade Center - 

The twin towers of the World Trade Center were places of employment for some 50,000 people. With the missing list of just over 5,000 people, that means 90% of the people targeted survived the attack. A 90% on a test is an 'A'. 

* The Pentagon - 

Some 23,000 people were the target of a third plane aimed at the Pentagon. The latest count shows that only 123 lost their lives. That is an amazing 99.5% survival rate. in addition, the plane seems to have come in too low, too early to affect a large portion of the building.On top of that, the section that was hit was the first of five sections to undergo renovations that would help protect the Pentagon from terrorist attacks. It had recently completed straightening and blast-proofing, savinguntold lives. This attack was sad, but a statistical failure. 

*** The Planes *** 

* American Airlines Flight 77 
This Boeing 757 that was flown into the outside of the Pentagon could have carried up to 289 people, yet only 64 were aboard. Luckily 78% of the seats were empty. 

* American Airlines Flight 11 
This Boeing 767 could have had up to 351 people aboard, but only carried 92. Thankfully 74% of the seats were unfilled. 

* United Airlines Flight 175 
Another Boeing 767 that could have sat 351 people only had 65 people on board. Fortunately it was 81% empty. 


* United Airlines Flight 93 

This Boeing 757 was one of the most uplifting stories yet. The smallest flight to be hijacked with only 45 people aboard out of a possible 289 had 84% of its capacity unused. Yet these people stood up to the attackers and thwarted a fourth attempted destruction of a national landmark, saving untold numbers of lives in the process. 

*** In Summary *** 
Out of potentially 74,280 Americans directly targeted by these inept cowards, 93% survived or avoided the attacks. That's a higher survival rate than heart attacks, breast cancer, kidney transplants and liver transplants - all common, survivable illnesses 

The Hijacked planes were mostly empty, the Pentagon was hit at it's strongest point, the overwhelming majority of people in the World Trade Center buildings escaped, and a handful of passengers gave the ultimate sacrifice to save even more lives. 

Pass this information on to those in fear and the media. Don't fear these terrorists. The odds are against them.

For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, &=
 VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by =
the middle of next week.

The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still=
 a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by=
 tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to positio=
n reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the=
 issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will repo=
rt shortly thereafter.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.

Thank you,

Shona Wilson

Outsourcing potential in trade receivables encourages S&P into the market
                                                                
Recognizing the ever growing need for greater operating efficiencies in the trade receivables market, Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions has created a new initiative to develop products and services to assist companies wishing to outsource their credit function. The market, estimated at $75 trillion globally, has a high transaction volume and a costly credit approval process, driving companies to look externally for solutions to increase efficiencies. 
 
 "For any company currently in the trade receivables market, credit processes are too slow, manually intensive and limited in scope, " says Roy Taub, executive managing director of Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions.  "Standard & Poor's has the capabilities, expertise and systems in place to deliver an efficient, on-line, short-term credit analysis service."

 

The new initiative, led by a Santa Fe, NM based team, will provide clients with an end-to-end solution to manage the trade receivable cycle; including tools for origination, portfolio management and securitization.  Recently, Standard & Poor's acquired the flagship trade receivable management system from Credit2B.  "With this new capability, Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions can offer tools to help clients measure and manage credit risk exposure across the full spectrum of maturities," said Camilo Gomez, PhD, managing director of Standard & Poor's new team and formerly Vice President of data and analytics at Credit2B, a company he helped start. 
 
In addition to serving direct sellers, the trade receivable management system will also help financial institutions involved in trade receivables to manage their portfolios of receivables and, as an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution, will allow them to provide services to their clients.  "By leveraging the Credit2B assets with Standard & Poor's own expertise in asset securitization, we can provide sellers with a one-stop solution to assess the risk they take with trade receivables, help monitor it on a continual basis and provide financial institutions with the tools to develop customized financial products for their customers." said Dr. Gomez. 
 
The new service will add to the existing quantitative capabilities from Risk Solutions, including: CreditModel ? in Europe, North America and Japan, an exclusive Default Filter license with IQ Financial in Asia, default and recovery data and analysis and an expanded quantitative staff in both London and New York.  
 
Risk Solutions, www.risksolutions.standardandpoors.com <http://www.risksolutions.standardandpoors.com/>, the customized credit risk services arm of Standard & Poor's, provides customized credit risk solutions, models and data to help clients manage their risk.

Rick, 

What is Rudi Zipter's status?  He has sent a couple of emails to Bobbi Tessandori our immigration representative .  He has taken vacation and paternity and repatriated back to the US.  Is he working in the office? Is he going to be retained? Please advise.

Regards,
Frank

Jim- Please add Michael Tribolet to EIM lead position for RAC. I will have a little crossover due to skill sets which I assume is ok, you really just need a lead to coordinate and manage the process. Lets meet on Monday. Can someone that is in Netco also be one of these coordinators? Rick

All, 

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards, 

Jim

Rick, we haven't scheduled a time but I think Bob does intend to talk to everyone.  Michael is here to represent individuals in the SEC and congressional proceedings  (in your case probably as co-counsel to JC) while Bob is company counsel.  The purpose of the split representation is to preserve the privilege with respect to discussions you have with J.C. or Michael.

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarantee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.  

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions.

Thank you.

Cut the present sealant with a razor knife and remove deck.
The remaining sealant can be scraped off with a plexiglass or acrylic
scraper (this allows you to easily remove the sealant without scratching
the gelcoat).
A new light tan or beige silicone sealant can be ordered through most
marine suppliers or your local Boston Whaler dealer (sorry, no factory
direct).
Whaler uses a silicone from Starbrite Co., Whaler part# 1081694 or
Starbrite's vendor part number 82180.
Please call 1-800-Whaler-9 or check the dealer locator on the Whaler
website for the location of your nearest Boston Whaler dealer for parts
pricing and availability.

I am planning to remove the large deck plate on my 25' Whaler Revenge
(1989). There is a sealant there now. How do I remove and what is your
recommendation for a replacement sealant. I am going to replace gas
hoses, both fill, vent and engine supply. Thanks for help. Rick Buy

Rick,

Attached are a clean copy of suggested modification of the body of this DASH as well as a copy of the original DASH.  This should give you some sense of the Arcos project's scale and risks.  John Sherriff and Michael Brown reportedly remain confident that this can be sold at a profit in the next three to nine months; however, if it is not, our economics on this project with a current termination cost of over $200 million is a negative NPV of approximately ($150 million).  The Enron board has not seen this, largely because the turbine cost is not specifically related to this project, but no other use of the turbines has been identified, so this project represents a huge potential loss if the sale is not successful.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss further.

Regards,

Dave

Pedro,

I have attached my mark-up of the body of the DASH (it is not possible to mark the entire DASH with the new template) for your review.  Many of the comments I have made were based upon input from Chip Schneider to try to promote comparability of this transaction with similar development projects undertaken in the U.S.  In general, the view from Houston is that this project represents a significant amount of capital at risk and that this fact, as well as the expected economics of the project, should be highlighted to a greater extent than in the draft of the DASH you prepared.  While not noted on the DASH, discussion of where the 9FA turbines may be redeployed if this transaction does not progress to completion should be discussed somewhere in the DASH.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,

Dave

Find attached the new Draft DASH for Arcos expenses.

There is a section in the risk matrix (political risk) which still needs to be finalised but I send it to you for any comments you may have.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Delainey

It might be good if you two participate in this discussion with Hickerson in the morning.  Also, David, you might want to discuss w/Whalley beforehand.  What exactly are we going to restrict Gary and his traders from trading?  Sheila Glover says we may have trader retention issues if the traders are prohibited from trading for their own account the securities that they are most familiar with...
 
But I think this is clearly contrary to how Ted, Legal, etc. think our policy should work.  So what are we willing to do to compromise, if anything?  The  policy says the Risk Committee can give dispensation.  To do this, do we want to require some type of review of Hickerson's personal accounts? And who would do that?
 
Cassandra.

Gary,
Judy is setting up a conference call for 15 minutes on Thursday morning to discuss Employee Trading, as currently defined in the Risk Management Policy which be sent to BOD this Friday.
 
The policy, as it currently stands, does not allow a person to trade positions in his personal account relating to his trading area.  For Financials, this has been defined to restrict to that employees' specific area of responsiblity.  For instance, the portfolio manager of Technology would not be able to hold tech stocks in his personal or 3rd party account.  
 
Cassandra will be able to provide some background on the input she is receiving from other groups.  
 
We can discuss alternatives which may be more palatable.  For instance, a person would declare where their personal brokerage accounts are held and statements are reviewed.
 
Sheila

Sheila - I tried to clarify it a bit more, so take a look at this instead of the version in the policy you received this morning.  Do you think we need to review w/Gary?  I think he told me his management had approved his traders trading for their own account, the same things they trade for Enron. I may have misunderstood.  But per extensive discussion on that subject with Legal, Compliance, Ted Murphy, etc., this is not what our policy has been to date, and per review of best practices at the big trading houses, our new policy will not permit this either.  Just wanted to make sure we're all on the same page.
(1st paragraph is the key - the rest is restricted list, etc.)
Thanks,
Cassandra.
7.2 Employee Trading
No employee of the Company may engage in the trading of any position for the benefit of any party other than the Company, whether for their own account or for the account of any third party, where such position relates to any security, commodity, contract or derivative thereof within any Commodity Group listed in Appendix A.  The only exception to this restriction is that employees may trade those items within the Commodity Groups listed under the heading "Financials" in Appendix A, if those items do not fall within such employee's responsibility at the Company.
Periodically, certain employees, their family members and anybody that is financially dependent on those employees, may also be restricted from trading specific securities and derivatives thereof.   In addition to these trading restrictions, if any employee should at any time possess non-public information about any public company, that employee, the employee's family members and anybody that is financially dependent on that employee, shall be restricted from trading in that issue, and that employee may not disclose the non-public material information to anyone that does not have a business need to know.  
Employees must seek dispensation from the Risk Management Committee for any exception to these requirements.  In no case should employees' personal trading conflict with the Company's trading initiatives. Employee with questions regarding employee trading and investing should contact the Company's Compliance department.

Since no one in your group could locate these guys either, I suggest that you have this type of information in RAC for every authorized signatory and their back-ups. This information needs to be available and communicated to all folks that are responsible for DASH signatures. If there is ever another situation where people are not available at any given time to sign a DASH, I want RAC to have a back-up plan in place. I'm holding RAC responsible for ensuring this process works. Once this DASH process has been fully vetted-including adding Whalley and Frevert, and the back-up plan in place- I want to have your folks working with EES and our Deal Management leads in a room to review the process and ensure everyone understands it.

Janet:

I appreciate you e-mail.  I will send an Executive Directory down to you.  It has my home #, cell #, and pager # in it.  I carry my cell phone and pager all the time and leave them on at night.  Also, I check my e-mail every day, even when on the road.  My e-mail address is:  andrew.fastow@enron.com.  Also, I have given Cheryl Lipschutz authority to sign for Ben or me on any DASHes, if we are unavailable.  Since she works for you, I'm sure you know that she has cell phones, pagers, etc. (and could have been reached all last week that way as well).

In this case, it sounds as simple as an administrative assistant not following through and your deal person not figuring out how to make direct contact.  As a result, your e-mail is perplexing.  If there is a different issue that we need to discuss, please let me know.  If not, I agree that discussion of this issue is now out of proportion and hopefully we can avoid it in the future.

Andy

They took the DASH to Ben Glisan on Thursday. He left Thursday pm and his Assistant never gave him the DASH. They tried contacting both you and Ben on Friday and apparently your Assistants were not here either. Cheryl Lipshutz had already given her approval and Trushar was executing on their behalf. I even had them look for Joe Deffner and he wasn't here either. Rick Buy was not here. I talked with Jay Hatchen/Dave Gorte and asked them to sign off for Corp. Finance given the situation. 

Andy, don't blow this out of proportion. I've asked Rick Buy in the past to create some sort of back-up approvals when we have situations like this come up. This isn't specifically about Corp. Finance, it happens from time to time with all signatory groups. You know how customers/deals are, sometimes they don't completely come together until just before execution. We just have to figure out a way to manage it.

RAC is responsible for all corporate DASH's-and this process- so I think they need to recommend a process with back-up approvals which we can all buy off on. 

And yes, you're right, I also should have called you directly.

I'm surprised to see an e-mail like this since I was in the office Monday-Wednesday last week, was available by voicemail and fax on Thursday-Friday and attended meetings with Dave Delainey in person and via phone all week long.  What's the deal with a communication like this?  Why not give me a call directly?

Just to be sure you're in the loop here, no one in Finance was available to sign this DASH last week. Not Fastow, not Glisan, their Assistants weren't in. Deffner wasn't here. Lipshutz wasn't here. etc, etc, etc. I told Hatchen, Gorte to represent Corp. Finance and Gorte gave verbal OK. We still haven't been able to get Fastow and Glisan to sign the DASH (I think they're back tomorrow). Deal is done and executed.

This is too difficult for someone in our Deal Management group to facilitate through our system. Maybe we need to give back-up authority to RAC for approvals in a situation like this. This may be a topic for our offsite on Friday.

Please find an aging from this Spring and a recent AR aging.  Leff is concentrating on the 31days+ ($101 million).    I do not have the reserve info, although I have asked twice.   Hopefully will get it this coming week.

       FROM ROB WALLS AND JOHN ALE

First, thank you very much for your prompt responses to our requests for comments on the draft Agreement and Plan of Merger distributed Tuesday and for items that would go on a disclosure schedule.  This has been hard work in a short period.

More hard work is to come.  Although no decision has been made on whether our company wishes to pursue this alternative and, if so, whether acceptable terms can be reached, we have been instructed to be in a position to sign the agreement and deliver the disclosure letter by this Sunday night.  To this end, we are attaching a revised draft of the agreement.

Please review again the provisions of this agreement to see whether there are any further changes to be made.  We are collating the information you have provided for disclosure schedules and will circulate a draft tonight or Friday morning for your further comments.

Note that we are attempting to have the term "Subsidiary" defined to include only consolidated subsidiaires.  We must be prepared, however, to include some representations about significant off-balance-sheet entities.  Accordingly, as you review drafts of the agreement and the disclosure letter, please note any comments that apply only to unconsolidated entities.  Please return your comments to Rob Walls (EB 5012) or John Ale (3AC 1023) by Friday at 3:00 pm.  If you send matters by email, please send it to both of us and Norma Tidrow (at Azurix).  

As before, if you need to speak with someone else in your group, please clear that with one of us.  If you have any questions, please call one of us.  Also, given that we may need to make changes over the weekend, please let us know how we can reach you over the weekend.

Thanks in advance for your continued help.

Rick,
I know you are just getting back in - I don't think anything requires your immediate attention - although I could use some help on the important but not burning issues like budgets, personell, trends in the business, what's up with Enron, initiatives that you think we should be undertaking.....

Just to give you a sense
Profit wise this has not shaped up to be a good quarter - we will be scrambling for some pretty big numbers in order to make the quarter - likely candidates are:
a look at the major curves (price and volatility) in UK power
deals with the major offtakers of TPL - British Energy, London Electricity....
a couple of portfolio deals in enroncredit
a significant alumina/aluminum swap with China National Container - I believe we have boxed the credit risk reasonably well.
what else?? I'll keep you posted.

Continue to see a ramp up in activity and requirements for coal and global products
I have talked to the new origination team working for Randy Maffet here and they are looking at some big and complex deals a al GAF
Haven't heard anything on project Nero (public EIM deal)  since I left you that message.
Lots of activity on the Continent particulary with EdF auctioning capacity
New deal in EBS - $4.3MM dollars in capacity payments - bad credit NEOS
EWZ joint venture looks likely to be signed.


The inflow of humans is starting - 2 new people monday, 2 more on the 17th, couple more before month end.
Sr. Director for Metals/Global mkts starts 10-15
have verbal offer acceptance from Sr. Director/Credit with focus on UK just recieved - probably a nov start.

We had an all-RAC EEL meeting with Michael Brown which seems well recieved.
Also did an initial cut of a 'risk review' of Enron Credit with Michael that went well.  Plan to do with you next week.

This month's Risk Magazine features 3 RAC employees - Daid Port and Rudi Zipter in an article about risk visualization and Christine Stanchus in an article regarding collateral managment.

let me know if there is anything you need from me or anything I should be thinking about.

Ted

ps  I'd pay admission to your meetings later this week.

Rick, 

What is Rudi Zipter's status?  He has sent a couple of emails to Bobbi Tessandori our immigration representative .  He has taken vacation and paternity and repatriated back to the US.  Is he working in the office? Is he going to be retained? Please advise.

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

TO:  All Current Enron Employees who Participate in the Enron Corp. Savings Plan


Due to an Enron programming error in the transmission of data to the Enron Corp. Savings Plan administrator, a number of currently active employees were erroneously coded with a status of terminated on the Savings Plan system.  

As a result, you may have received a notice from Hewitt Associates, the Savings Plan administrator, indicating that you were a terminated employee and providing you with options for your Savings Plan account.  This notice was sent in error, and should be disregarded.

This situation was identified and corrected.  We regret any confusion or inconvenience this may have caused. 

If you would like to verify that your Savings Plan employment status has been corrected, you may log in to the Savings Plan website through the Enron intranet (benefits.enron.com) or the internet (resources.hewitt.com/enron) and view your status in the "Personal Data" option off the main log-in screen.  

If you have further questions, please contact a representative at the Benefits Service Center at 800-332-7979, option 3.

As the November elections approach, I encourage everyone to exercise your right to be heard and to make a difference through your vote.  To do so, you'll need to have a valid voter's registration.  If you do need to register, please visit your county's website or call your county election officials to learn the procedures and timing.

For Houston-based employees:
The deadline for voter registration in Texas is October 9.  Voter registration forms are available at the InfoZone in the lobby, but if you choose to mail your form please allow enough time for the postal service to deliver your form.  See the following list if you need to obtain election information pertaining to Harris and surrounding counties.  As the election date nears, Harris county voters' guides will be available at the InfoZone in the lobby.

Harris		713-368-2309
Montgomery	936-539-7843
Waller		979-826-7643
Brazoria	979-864-1320

Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

?=09The first week of September was extremely positive for the region with =
a significant increase in secondary trading volumes and bond prices. Relati=
ve financial stabilisation in Argentina removed pressure from Latin America=
n and other emerging markets, shifting the focus to the impact of local fac=
tors on prices in each region. It was a busy week in the Turkish market, wh=
ich started initially on a weaker note because of the disappointing inflati=
on data released on Monday, but then recovered to follow other Eastern Euro=
pean markets and closed around 1.5 points higher on the week. The long awai=
ted resignation of the Minister of Public Works added to the positive senti=
ment in the market. The Russian market rallied this week, first on the back=
 of Latam stabilisation and then encouraged by the Moody's rating upgrade (=
see below). Prices peaked on Thursday, immediately after the upgrade, but f=
ailed to stay at those levels due to profit taking and a sliding Latam mark=
et, closing only one point higher than last Friday. Central and Eastern Eur=
opean investment grade assets remained stable throughout the week, which is=
 a good sign given the sell-off in US Treasuries. Other countries in this r=
egion gained around ? point, with Romania being the best performer gaining =
? point.
?=09On Wednesday, Moody's raised the ratings of outstanding Eurobonds of th=
e Russian Federation to B2 from B3 and changed the outlook for all hard cur=
rency instruments to "positive" from "stable." Moody's noted that Russia's =
recent economic performance and tax reforms have generated twin surpluses (=
current account and budget) and large foreign currency reserves. In combina=
tion with some debt relief, these factors have made the country's capacity =
to service its debt much greater.

	In August we were discussing the additional information needs that Corporate Development has re: an electronic repository for the original models, pitch books, research, etc. on assets/deals, plus any current work Corporate Development, the business unit or RAC may have done.  Some of the information Corp Dev was interested in was financial data for each asset (EBITDA, NI, debt, etc.) that I think could be added to the PortRac system.  The remainder of the data Corp Dev was looking to have on hand electronically was to be part of a new livelink application that Cornelio was going to help develop.  The attached ppt file describes the user needs for this development project.  

The question is - Who is the new business unit sponsor since I've left the group?  The information is not dissimilar to what RAC/Underwriting maintain, plus RAC/Underwriting have the right staff to maintain the livelink application.  It's just a matter of getting the right approvals for this additional work load to be budgeted for Rick Carson's group and also having the group meet with various Corp Dev folks (use the ppt file attached) to establish the support relationship.  Please call if you need anything further.  Sherron.

Sherron,

It's been a while since we had our last meeting. I would like to follow-up with you regarding the Asset Library. I would like to find out if you are still interested in pursuing this project. We left off on issues surrounding RAC and integrating your operations with them. I have not been aware of any decisions regarding this, as well as direction that you wish to go. I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks.


Cornelio

Last week we completed preliminary ROCAR calculations on the following deals:

					ROCAR

Georgia Pacific/Leaf River		29.03%

Owens DSM				10.75%

Project Oz				 2.74%


These results place Georgia Pacific at the high end of all of the deals we have looked at so far.  The ROCAR for GP includes the impact of the swap which only slightly improved the return (versus the asset only) due to the credit risk associated with a BBB minus credit.

Owens is about on par with other energy management deals we have seen coming out off EES.  Operational risk (implementation/contract risk) is considered low due to the ongoing nature of the project.

Project Oz is one of the worst deals we have analyzed.  Margins are very thin, and due to the illiquid nature of the asset, market risk is very large (1 day VAR $45MM).

Since most of the ROCAR's are still not included on the DASH, I will provide you with weekly updates on the current deals we are analyzing.

Regards,

Mark

Rick.

Hang in there.  Beleive it or not, everyone in the industry I talk with is
pulling for Enron.  I hope the bank deal comes through quickly.

I wonder which beach AF is on right now.

I thought I'd pass this along in case you need a laugh.

Jim

Subject: Amended Complaint in Amalgamated Bank v. Lay, et al.



Good evening, everyone.  Mike Peterson, who many of you have met and who is working with J.C. on your case, asked me to send the following e-mail to you:

The lawyers for Amalgamated Bank filed an amended class action complaint yesterday. Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one (our comparison was "line by line" but not "word for word"), it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely, "to order an accounting of insider-trading proceeds," "disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds," "restitution of investors' monies of which they were defrauded," and "as to the section 11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages." These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action. If you nonetheless would like your own copy of the amended complaint (all 78 pages), just let me know and I will send it to you.

J.C. asked me to send you the following message:

"The hearing has concluded. The Court has not frozen anyone's assets or ordered any discovery at this point in time. The Court made no final decision today except to deny any relief against Arthur Andersen. The Court expressed skepticism that the plaintiffs had met the required showing of particularity as to each defendant. The Court wanted additional briefing on preliminary legal issues before she reaches a decision on any issue, and gave the parties until December 20th to complete the briefing on those issues. We think it went well and hope to talk to you in more detail over the next few days."

Write Stuff
We love to spotlight emails we get from seasoned users of Visor handhelds, but it's also great fun to hear from our newest customers like Angela P., who just got her Visor handheld over the holidays.

>From a Visor Newbie
This little doozy has to be the greatest invention of all time. I just wanted to send you an email and let you know how much I love it! I ordered it on-line before Thanksgiving and got it shortly thereafter.

It's amazing how much information you can have at your fingertips! Two things that I've done with it so far is added my vehicle info to my Memo pad (maintenance records / insurance info) to a category called CARS. (So the next time I take my car in for an oil change and they say, "When was the last time you replaced your air filter," I'll be like, "Well, funny that you ask because I've got that info right here." Love that!!

Also, I love the capability to have all of my health insurance info at my fingertips. I made a category on my Memo pad and included info like who my insurance is for dental, health, vision, plus my doctors names, numbers, etc... not to mention that I've got numbers, addresses, and email info for everyone. And that handy little calendar from Outlook that reminds me of stuff-all at my fingertips! I'm just learning about all the capabilities, but so far, I think IT'S FABULOUS! I'm telling everyone I know to get one!

Thanks again!
Angela P.

Rick, 

Lynn recently demo'd portrac for all of us in Corp Development.  It is a fantastic tool.  It's been needed for forever - I've been pulling together an asset list for Andy and Jeff Donahue - and I know first hand how difficult it is to get the detail that your group has input into portrac.  Donahue also thinks it's a great tool.  Lynn is going to demo it for Andy sometime soon.

I'm working with Lynn and Dave Gorte's folks (Cindy Hudler) to create a livelink library of models, presentations, tax structures, etc. (all the files a corp dev person needs when we actively work an asset for sale).  We hope to have a link on the portrac web page similar to the DASH and COMET links.  It's very encouraging to see how far your group has come in organizing our investment data - Cindy's got a 30GB file of all models.  It sure makes my supposed 6 - 9 month job easier!

I left a voice mail for David since he's out, but I have a suggestion on our reporting for this meeting (not that I'm reporting anymore...).  I wasn't included in the discussions on how this report started up again, so I may not have all the facts on why we're doing what we're doing.

- at a minimum, we should use the Commodity DPR instead of the Business Unit DPR - for example, he was unable to see the 850 Bcf
	NA Gas NOP, or the components thereof as the Business Unit DPR is used

- would it be worthwhile to do a report that shows a week on week comparision of NOP, M/G, and VaR, with a 5-day P/L, based on the 	Concentration Limit DPR?  It seems to me that is what he's looking for - what happened this past week, and why, not just what our 
	current position is.  This type of report is also consistent with how Credit presents their information (week on week change).

Let me know if you agree, and maybe Veronica can have that ready for you next week.


Regards,

Cassandra.

Attached is a draft of the NewPower DASH.  The maximum amount available against AR and Inventory may adjust slightly based on projected eligible accounts receivable versus ineligble.   We also need to coordinate the legal risk memo.

Not with the change but since in this case the limit is a BOD limit I would want to give myself some discretion between an allocation to PGE and the limit the BOD sets. 
I'm not so sure that this level of VaR isn't a little high for essentially a non trading entity. Suggest we keep our eye on it.

Rick,
 
I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .
 
1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.
 
2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
 
If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.
 
Thanks.

Thanks Sharon and Rick,

I have one request and one question.

One point that came out from our "dry run" meeting this afternoon with a handful of our top bankers indicated that we need to be very clear on what RAC's responsibilities are.  The slide looks like:

*Market risk management - (followed by brief description of what this means)
*Credit risk management - ditto
*Underwriting - ditto
*Portfolio - ditto

Rick, this will feed into the "What went wrong" slide.

My question is related to the "Cash Colloateral" pg. Is "Net Cash" in the legend supposed to be "Net Cash Margin"?

I will be in office Sat. and probably Sun.  

We need to have the complete presentation ready to send to New York for book preparation by Sunday at noon.

Please call me at work if you have any questions.

Thanks for the help,

Kelly

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK

If we sell all of the following mutual funds in HM-E0030:
Munder Money Market
Munder Net Net
MFS Emerging Growth
Pimco Growth
Putman Voyager

That should bring available cash for equities to: $190,000

We can open a new managed account with a Large Cap
Value manager (NWQ) and fund it with $100,000

We can add $30,000 to HM-E0069 bringing the account
balance to appx $103,000 and replace the manager with
Newbridge (a different large cap growth)

We can add the remaining $60,000 to HM-E0070 bringing
the account balance to appx $154,000 and replace the
manager with Fayez (a different core manager)

After all the dust settles the accounts should look like:

Fayez (Core S&P) $154,000    43%
Newbridge (Large Cap Growth) $103,000   29%
NWQ (Large Cap Value) $100,000    28%

We will drop the documents of at the front desk
on Wednesday.

Herewith draft revised budget:

 
I added some costs for market data which were perviously allocated in from Networks and which I don't think were factored in
Despite the loss of two people today from the proposed research group I have left the HC in there for replacements
I adjusted compensation and mix of grades

Please find attached the below referenced budget for NETCO for Market Risk/Research combined.  Included currently are primarily the basic employee costs based on average salaries and wages and average run rates (based on Sept 2001 YTD costs) for other types of expenses for your department.  It is very important that any additional costs specific to your department which you feel are not represented in this budget be added at this time.  Please review this budget and confirm to me your agreement or any changes or additions to it by 3:00 pm today.

Please feel free to contact me at X30669 with any questions you have regarding this information.

Faith Killen is putting together the new budget for Netco.  I would like to emphasize that you need to include all of your costs of restart (new software licences, additional legal support etc).  Please work with Faith to validate the numbers she is producing for January 3, 2002.

Good news for Body Shop members! The Body Shop will reopen Monday, January 7, 2002. While we recognize that the Body Shop is a tremendous asset to all of our employees' health and wellness, we must reopen it without an Enron subsidy. Therefore, the membership fee will increase from $25 to $30 per month for all Enron employees and contractors. Spouse memberships will remain at $15 per month. Locker fees will remain at $10 per month and members may keep their current locker. (If you emptied your locker after the Body Shop closed in December, please notify the Body Shop reception desk that you would like to reoccupy it.)
The overall price increase, coupled with reduced expenses, will enable the Body Shop to reopen and remain open on a cash-neutral basis to meet creditors' requirements. Payroll deductions will be reactivated with the January 15th payroll and will include the increased fee. If you do not wish to continue your membership, please contact the Body Shop to cancel your membership via email only at <mailto:Body.Shop@enron.com>.  Membership information and enrollment forms can be accessed below:  

	   

The Body Shop's new hours will be 6:00 a.m. - 7:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and 6:00 a.m. - 6:00 p.m. on Friday. Saturday hours are not offered at this time. 
Although laundry service has been discontinued, towels will continue to be available for your convenience. Once the ongoing membership base and associated revenues have been stabilized to support staffing and housekeeping, exercise classes will be scheduled. We anticipate exercise classes to be available within a few weeks. Massage therapy services will continue and are available by appointment by calling extension 3-3047.  
Whether you are a continuing member or considering new membership, there is no better time for you to take advantage of the Body Shop and to take care of your personal health and well being than right now, at the beginning of 2002.
Your continued support is greatly appreciated.

Subject: EH&S Data Management and Process Safety Management Technology Sem

Date: 13 September 2001 14:00
Priority: High

Every quarter or so, Data Systems & Solutions hosts seminars to educate
clients in the process industries on the value of integrated environmental,
health & safety management information systems (EMIS).  Our last seminar on
May 3, 2001 resulted in over 30 clients attending.

We are planning two additional seminars this year (Integrating Process
Safety Management - October 11th) and (Integrated EH&S Solutions - November
6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For
instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a "hot" topic
right now.  Overall, the top three interests we are hearing from our
customers on the topic of EMIS include:

1. Sustainable Development "Triple Bottom Line" coupled with Key Performance
Metrics/Roll-Up Reporting
2. Integrating Information Systems with EMIS
3. Risk Reduction

The ever looming concern over cost justification has become much clearer and
will be addressed in future seminars.  Even today, there is no "panacea" for
EH&S software applications.  Most vendors address the "E" picture or the
"H&S" picture, but do not cover both holistically.  With emerging
information technology protocols such as extensible markup language (XML) it
is now possible to get a true "best of breed" solution that will allow you
to "plug and play" modules instead of hoping for everything in one software
vendor.  Unfortunately, the EMIS software marketplace still remains
unconsolidated and there are inherent risks with selecting a software
vendor.  The goal of our one day seminar is to address all of these concerns
and to help our customers to understand what is involved in a typical EMIS
project...from an initial assessment of your needs, to determining the value
of an EMIS and the core reasons for doing it, to selecting systems where
gaps exist, to allocating proper resources to ensure a successful project,
to implementing the solution, to integrating with other facility information
systems, and maintenance and training.

Let us know if you or anyone from your organization are interested in
attending our seminar.  We want to give you the most value possible in our
one day educational forum.  Please let us know if there is anything in
particular that you would like to get information on that may not be covered
in the topics listed on the agenda.
http://www.ds-s.com/Products/EH&S/index.htm gives a current listing of our
EMIS services.

I talked to Ray Bowen today regarding the Finance Comm. book.  He and Jeff will combine the old CFO and Treasurer's report into one Finance Report.  Please make a placeholder on the agenda.  The materials will most likely be handed out at the meeting, so please put in a sheet saying that behind their tab.  

Thanks to each of you for your diligence on this effort. Paula

Subject: Pug's Fax



Here are my thoughts on some of Pug's comments (Karen has faxed the memo from Pug I believe): 

1       Roles of Audit and Finance Committees 

I agree with the distinction he draws and I don't see why the entire Board should not see risk/return information.  We can tweak the policy to bring this to the fore.

2       Post-Audit 

I'll talk to Gorte 

3       Capital Allocation 

Complex. Charges for risk capital would not be as difficult as allocating funding. Building balance sheets is key. 

4       Trading Limits 

In my last tome I have effectively limited the use of D-VaR to the levels specified by the concentration buckets, so I think we have satisfied that concern. 

With position limits I would argue that ones needs them where VaR does not "callibrate" well, for example with Steel trading where there is no observable options market, you need more metrics to tell you about the risk. Conversely in US Gas I think the market is fairly deep and the VaR tells us much about the risk. Also, in a similar fashion to "model approval" under Basle Capital Adequacy rules, the quality of the risk administration process and other controls could make us more comfortable about just using VaR.

5       Reporting 

Policy Section 4.1.2.3.1 talks about violations and notifications. He is asking should he not be called for a five day loss (c) and an ETL excess (d), in addition to the usual corporate VaR breach and one day loss > VaR. I think the five day loss actually would warrant a Pug call because under the new method (5 day loss > 225% of VaR), the number could be very large (but also less likely). For ETL I would advise against having a Pug call on this since we still need to get the metric bedded down properly (and all the usual arguments about the math played out).

The phrase "at their discretion" to which he refers means that the Risk Committee can tell who they like about violations, as they deem necessary - so its just built-in flexibility.

6       Liquidity 

We are cranking this right now. 

Other news 

Gas off approximately 15c across the strip today - Friday was quiet. 
George has made $9m over the last 5 days as crude has come off 50 - 60c 
ENE is $36 (horrible)

Rick,

This is consistent with all of his coal business.  They have 5.5mm tonne short position which they will source with trades that require incremental collateral (capital).

Are there lots more. If not, $2.5 million is not Whalley level discussion. Same point as we discussed this am. Rick

Bill, 

It's about 2.5 million dollars (cash not LC), and this helps us cover a short position we need to cover.  I want to do this deal.

What do you want to about this?  This is tying up capital when we are a little bit short on capital.

John:

Appreciate seeing the old e-mail again, but remind you that the Shenhua cargo was agreed 22 Oct.  As mentioned, we will certainly try to push Shenhua to entertain alternative arrangements, but the Chinese are usually quite difficult on this subject (to date, all Chinese cargoes have required Enron to post an LC).  It's a good idea to get Shankman thinking about this one today, because it is likely that we will need to post an LC for this cargo.  If timing is an issue, I'm sure we can drag the process out a few weeks since delivery is not until mid-Jan.

Regardless, need your input as soon as possible on whether we can continue transacting business where cash collection is not coincident (or in advance of) cash out the door.

Thks,

Stu

Stu - 

As per the e-mail below, RAC must be contacted prior to transacting on an L/C basis.  This was the same message I conveyed to the Australian team early last week.  The Shenhua deal definitely falls within the description and is an issue to be resolved.

I will talk to Jeff Shankman today about the use of L/Cs and capital in the near future, and see what resolution can be reached with the positions and strategy you hold in your book.

In this current climate we should try wherever possible not to commit to posting collateral to counterparties for physical purchases of product unless absolutely necessary.  We should offer an Enron Corp guarantee as an alternative.  In the event that we are asked to post security to a counterparty would you please contact credit before doing so.
The credit hotline number is 36555

thanks for your co-operation.

Paul

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK

As you are aware, we are in the process of rescheduling the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting.  Due to the proximity of the Holidays we will hold committee meetings and Board meeting on the same day. 

Therefore, please let us know today the minimum amount of time you would need for your respective committee meetings.  

Please be aware that some of our Directors will be joining the meeting via teleconference and we will therefore need to do all mail outs at least one week in advance.

As soon as we have a firm date for the Board meeting, we will advise you.

Thank you.

In an effort to better organize the activities and minimize the expenses related to the Chapter 11 filing, we have formed the Bankruptcy Management Committee.  There are many outside firms representing multiple parties that will be requesting, among other things, certain tasks to be performed, filings with the bankruptcy court, financial analysis and general business information.  To ensure these activities are coordinated, the Bankruptcy Management Committee will now be responsible for overseeing this process.  The following is a list of some of the parties that may contact you directly.  If anyone from these firms, or other firms, contacts you related to the bankruptcy, please notify a member of the committee to ensure the efforts are coordinated.  All outside firms will be requested to notify a member of the committee prior to contacting other Enron personnel or outside parties, including the court and Creditors' Committee.

	Firm						Relationship

	Bankruptcy court (i.e. motions, etc.)		
	Creditors' Committee
	U.S. Trustee
	Ernst & Young					Accountants for the Creditor's Committee
	Houlihan, Lokey, Howard & Zukin		Financial advisors for the Creditors' Committee
Blackstone					Financial advisors for Enron
Batchelder and Partners				Financial advisors for Enron
Weil, Gotshal and Manges			Bankruptcy attorneys for Enron
Milbank Tweed					Attorneys for the Creditors' Committee
Andrews and Kurth				Attorneys for Enron Corp



The following are the members of the Bankruptcy Management Committee:

Ray Bowen - Chairman
Bob Butts
Jim Fallon
Dave Glassford
Dave Gorte
Mark Muller
Julia Murray
Lou Stoler

Initially, this committee will meet on a daily basis to organize all the bankruptcy related activities as well as to prioritize requests going to the Creditors' Committee and the court.  It is extremely important that the company provides accurate and timely information to the court, the Creditors' Committee and their advisors.  Accordingly, we request the assistance of all employees and outside firms in coordinating the bankruptcy efforts with this newly formed committee.

Rick,

My views are as follows:

- The sale of the deepwater assets makes sense due to their requirement of significant ongoing capital expenditures; the other assets of the company should also be auctioned off concurrently (although we would retain the right to continue to hold them if the offers received were inadequate); research into our commitments to Lehman as the sales advisor previously needs to be conducted (I have asked Don Miller in Corporate Development to research this).

- The fact that the Mariner severance package is considerably better than the Enron package will be is a significant optical issue and not reducing it may create an issue with the creditors committee for the Enron bankruptcy.

- The extension of employment agreements and consulting agreements, in my opinion, should be for a shorter time period, say to March 31, 2002, again in light of the Enron situation and the optics to the creditors committee.

Dave

As discussed during our recent demonstration of our new portfolio tracking system (PortRAC), we have completed a security system that will provide a "firewall" controlling access to each business unit's data.  Our intent is to open up the system to designated members of each business unit or others as approved by the COO or Managing Director of that group. 
 
In order to complete the initial setup, we need to receive a listing of approved users for your business unit and their login Id's. If you prefer to delegate security approval authority to someone else on your staff, please let us know and we will establish procedures with them. 
 
If additional demonstrations of PortRAC are necessary for your group, please let us know.
 
Thank you for your assistance.          Rick C.

Enron and Dynegy each announced today that they are holding discussions about a possible merger of the two companies.  As you know, Dynegy is a major player in the energy marketplace, and is not only a competitor, but also a counterparty of Enron.  This is just one of several options that we are considering.

Upon receipt of this announcement, the NYSE briefly suspended trading of both Enron and Dynegy.  We have no additional information we can share at this time.  We'll keep you updated as developments occur.

The Extreme VaR functionality is now operational on the RaC website.  The testing phase is completed, but ongoing calibration and fine-tuning will continue.  Extreme VaR represents a complement to Regular VaR, but concentrates on the Extreme Tail regions.  The default shown on the screen is at 99.7%.
It can easily be set up for any portfolio of interest and at a user-specified confidence level.

The following document summarizes the procedure to invoke it from your websites.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Here are my thoughts on some of Pug's comments (Karen has faxed the memo from Pug I believe):

1	Roles of Audit and Finance Committees

I agree with the distinction he draws and I don't see why the entire Board should not see risk/return information.  We can tweak the policy to bring this to the fore.

2	Post-Audit

I'll talk to Gorte

3	Capital Allocation

Complex. Charges for risk capital would not be as difficult as allocating funding. Building balance sheets is key.

4	Trading Limits

In my last tome I have effectively limited the use of D-VaR to the levels specified by the concentration buckets, so I think we have satisfied that concern. 

With position limits I would argue that ones needs them where VaR does not "callibrate" well, for example with Steel trading where there is no observable options market, you need more metrics to tell you about the risk. Conversely in US Gas I think the market is fairly deep and the VaR tells us much about the risk. Also, in a similar fashion to "model approval" under Basle Capital Adequacy rules, the quality of the risk administration process and other controls could make us more comfortable about just using VaR.

5	Reporting

Policy Section 4.1.2.3.1 talks about violations and notifications. He is asking should he not be called for a five day loss (c) and an ETL excess (d), in addition to the usual corporate VaR breach and one day loss > VaR. I think the five day loss actually would warrant a Pug call because under the new method (5 day loss > 225% of VaR), the number could be very large (but also less likely). For ETL I would advise against having a Pug call on this since we still need to get the metric bedded down properly (and all the usual arguments about the math played out).

The phrase "at their discretion" to which he refers means that the Risk Committee can tell who they like about violations, as they deem necessary - so its just built-in flexibility.

6	Liquidity

We are cranking this right now.

Other news

Gas off approximately 15c across the strip today - Friday was quiet.
George has made $9m over the last 5 days as crude has come off 50 - 60c
ENE is $36 (horrible)

I need to discuss this deal with you...it is essentially a physical option to supply steel to a very large service center with locations in the US and in Europe.  The challenge for you guys will be that it will require a $30mil option payment to them.  Very good deal without credit issues...pls call me when you have a chance.

I have run an indicative credit reserve which comes out at $15m.

It should be made clear at this stage the number is only indicative and subject to further change and discussion.  Forward price curves and volatilities will need to be confirmed, as will the option structure.

We still want to achieve the best possible contractual terms through pursuing collateral rights and should consider other risk-mitigating options such as bankruptcy protection.  The tenor and $ exposure would warrant sign-off at a very senior level, and will obviously be covered by the DASH approval.

The deal is clearly of great value to Enron, but we should question the motives of Balli in wanting or needing to do this.  How much do we know about their exisiting banking relationships and ability to access funding at present?

I'm sure we will discuss further.

Paul

Bruce Garner has asked me to bring you into a trade we're looking at with Balli-Klockner (BK). Ken Curry was asked to evaluate a related proposal a week back but is now on holiday and Rebecca Phillips was not brought up to speed. This latest proposal would be a European trade and the client is under time constraints and keen to move fast.

The transaction is as follows:

Enron has the right to sell to BK physical Hot Rolled Coil steel at Index (CRU HRC) + 7.5% 

Start:  Jan2002

End:    Dec2016

Tonnage:        500 000 Metric Tonnes per annum (total tonnage: 7.5 million MT)

Enron pays a premium of 30 million USD upon contracting.

The CRU Index is Enron's benchmark steel index and physical steel trades at Index flat. There is thus 7.5% intrinsic value in the puts which translates to approx. $75 million USD in present value terms ($45million net of premium).

Our counterparty would be the parent of the soon to be combined Balli Klockner PLC and the various Balli service centres soon to be merged (BK Holdings Ltd UK). BK are not offering us additional credit relief, ie. bank guarantees, LC's, insurance bonds, etc. Your help in establishing our appetite and an appropriate credit charge for this transaction would be much appreciated.

Many thanks

Simon Cose

Working on the New Power deal really gets one thinking about the liquidity provisions in contracts (collateral posting provisions).   Given the emphasis on the swings in net cash/credit posted at a Enron Corp level, perhaps we should think of metric to measure the posting risk.   Contracts have different thresholds (or none at all) and the effect on our credit capacity is not always symetrical.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
EES???-All
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
Private Equity Trading-Gorte
Credit Consistency study- Buy

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment.

Please see the attached list of Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interviewers below.  As you will see we are still short of our targeted numbers for quality interviewers.  Given the economic climate and the perceived ability for us to recruit the best candidates, it is extremely important for our interview team to be the best of the best.  We still need your help in getting volunteers.  While prefering not to weight the interview team very heavily with Managers, I realize this is reality, especially on the November 15,16 dates because of the Management Conference.  Please re-poll your teams and provide more names for interviewers.  We would like to have this flanged up by Friday, October 12.  Thanks you again for all your help and participation.  Ted

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.     
							Regards!
							Rick C.

APPROPRIATION BILLS WRAPPED UP

When President Bush issued his proposed fiscal year 2002 budget to Congress last April, investment in research and development was not a top priority in most federal agencies.  Eight months and a major terrorist attack later, Congress and the President agreed to put aside their disagreements over funding levels for most federal programs until another day.  

Here is a brief summary of how energy and space research programs fared in the recent appropriations cycle.  Information on funding for research programs at the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the Department of Defense will appear in Update next week.

Energy

Funding for energy research and development programs are divided between two appropriations bills - Energy & Water and Interior.  The Energy Committee of ASME's Council on Engineering submitted testimony last spring on the energy programs contained in both bills.  Copies of the testimony are available at:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-21.html
and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-22.html

The Interior bill provides funding for fossil energy and energy conservation R&D programs.  In its testimony to the House and Senate Appropriations Committees, the COE Energy Committee recommended several key areas that it believed merited increases above the President's request. 

In all of those areas - carbon sequestration, advanced gas turbines, and fuel cell research - Congress ultimately supported the ASME Committee's recommendations.  For carbon sequestration, the President had requested $20.6 million, the ASME Committee had recommended $29.6 million, and Congress ultimately appropriated $32.1 million.  The President had proposed eliminating the advanced gas turbine program; the Committee had recommended that funding be restored to a level of $30 million, $1.1 million more than in FY 2001.  Congress decided on a level of $18.5 million.  For fuel cell research, the administration had proposed $45.1 million, a reduction of $7.2 million from the FY01 level.  The ASME Energy Committee had recommended $61.1 million, and Congress appropriated $58.1, which was higher than either the House or the Senate had recommended in their individual bills.

In the Energy & Water appropriations bill, renewable energy research funding was set at $396 million which, while $40 million less than the Senate bill, was $20 million above the House-passed number, $120 million above the President's request, and $21 million above current levels.

Nuclear Energy Research received $250.5 million, which is $27 million more than the President's request, but $9 million less than current levels.  The Nuclear Energy Research Initiative received $32 million, which is $19.2 million more than the President requested, $15 million more than the House version, but $6 million less than the Senate recommended and $3 million less than the ASME Energy Committee recommendation.  The Nuclear Energy Plant Optimization Program received $7 million, which is $2 million more than the President's request, the House bill, and current levels, but $2 million less than the Senate bill, and $3 million less than the Energy Committee recommended.

DOE science programs were funded at $3.2 billion, an increase of $73.2 million over the budget request and $52.7 million above fiscal year 2001.  High energy physics was funded at the request level of $716.1 million.  Nuclear physics also was funded at the request level of $360.5 million.  Biological and environmental research received $527.4 million, an increase of $84.4 million over the request. Funding for basic energy sciences was set at $1 billion, a decrease of $1 million from the request, although that total includes full funding for the Spallation Neutron Source.  The Advanced Scientific Computing Research Initiative was allocated $158 million, a decrease of $5 million from the request.  Finally, fusion energy research was funded at $248.5 million, the same as the request and the COE Energy Committee recommendation.

National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)

Funding for NASA's R&D programs is included in the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill.  National Science Foundation programs also are included in that bill.  ASME's Inter-Council Committee on Federal R&D has task forces that prepared testimony on both NASA's and NSF's budget requests.   Copies of the testimony can be found at:  http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-11.html
and http://www.asme.org/gric/ps/2001/01-23.html


Overall, NASA received $10.2 billion for its research programs, which is $343 million, or 3.5 percent, more than it received in FY01.  Of that amount, $1.72 billion is allocated for the International Space Station, which is a $440 million, or 15.2 percent reduction from last year.  Congress is increasingly concerned about cost overruns on the station, and has been highly critical of NASA's management of the project.  Among programs receiving substantial increases were Aero-Space Technology, which received a 12.4 percent ($275 million) increase, for a total of $2.49 billion; and Space Science, which received $2.84 billion, $224 million, or 8.5 percent, more than last year.


MATH AND SCIENCE PARTNERSHIPS AT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND NSF

When President Bush announced his education plan last February, he proposed a Math and Science Partnership Initiative at the National Science Foundation, emphasizing a need for better science and mathematics education across the country.  Possible partners for the Math and Science Partnerships could include the State Education Agency, a math, science, or engineering department of an institution of higher education, a high need Local Education Agency, businesses, and nonprofit and for-profit groups of demonstrated effectiveness.

The House and Senate Education Committees, when drafting their education legislation, also thought the Math and Science Partnership program was needed, but placed the program at the Department of Education.  In the end, now that the authorization and appropriation process is complete, there are programs at both NSF and Department of Education.  The two agencies are in fact forming a task force to address the issue.  

The FY 2002 Labor-HHS-Education appropriations conferees only appropriated $12.5 million for the newly-established Math and Science Partnerships at the Department of Education, which were authorized at $450 million in the recently approved Elementary and Secondary Education Authorization Act.  However, the FY 2002 VA/HUD appropriations bill, provided another $160 million for similar partnerships to be awarded by NSF.

In addition, the Labor-HHS-Education conferees encouraged states to continue making science and math instruction a high priority by also using other federal funds available for teacher improvement.  A total of $2.85 billion was appropriated for overall Teacher Quality.

GAO BEGINS NEW INVESTIGATION INTO FEDERAL OFFICE OF PIPELINE SAFETY

In response to a request by Representative John Dingell, ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, the General Accounting Office has begun another investigation into the Department of Transportation's Office of Pipeline Safety, specifically focusing on OPS's approach to preventing terrorist attacks like those of September 11, and whether the OPS has sufficient resources and personnel to deal with such events.

On October 3, GAO released an investigative report on OPS that said the agency had made progress, but still had the lowest rating of any transportation agency in implementing National Transportation Safety Board recommendations.

For more information, contact Francis Dietz at dietzf@asme.org.

BUSH NOMINATES ORBACH TO HEAD DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY OFFICE OF SCIENCE

President Bush has announced his intention to nominate Raymond Orbach to be Director of the Department of Energy's Office of Science.  The Chancellor of the University of California Riverside since 1992, Orbach served for ten years as Provost of UCLA's College of Letters and Science.   He has also served on numerous professional, scientific, and civic boards, as well as held visiting professorships at institutions in several countries, including Tel Aviv University, the Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, and the Ecole Superieure de Physique et Chimie Industrielle de la Ville De Paris.
 
DOE's Office of Science is responsible for the department's civilian research in high energy and nuclear physics, fusion energy sciences, basic energy sciences, biological and environmental research and computational science, and ten DOE civilian laboratories.

El Paso BOD killed due to capital sourcing uncertainty.  They have asked for an option until the midle of Feb.  Makes sense to evaluate versus an auction.  In the meantime we do need to send a call notice for their LP interest on Monday.

I believe that an auction will likely result in more litigation from Brazos but that might be a risk we are willing to take.  Don Miller noted yesterday that auctions (which were already seeing price deterioration) will possibly evolve to include financing outs.  All depends upon the speed of a recovery in the debt markets.

Chad-Please take the Cornhusker model we sent El paso and see what the NPV is on a roll forward basis.  We need to see whether we have any value issues by giving el paso a call (ie does the npv accrete as we roll forward).

Duran is set to discuss with el paso today and we will make any go forward decisions after.

I hope this finds you and all your close ones well.  What a crazy world
we seem to be in at the moment.  We want to communicate to friends and
associates some of our current perspectives. 

Pre September 11

We had already been operating under the assumption that our economy has
been in a recession for a while.  Although the technical definition of
recession may not have been achieved, we can't see much difference between
positive 0.2% and negative 0.1% economic growth.  We also thought the
trillion dollar plus loss in stock market wealth had to manifest itself
into a general economic contraction.  We had not expected to see the trends
of growing lay offs and shrinking cash flows to turn around until the
third quarter of 2002.  Our perspectives have been more pessimistic than
the general market up until September 11.  We believe both expansions
and contractions can feed off themselves.  The current contraction seemed
to validate this.  We also believe it is usually significant events that
provide the catalyst to turning these trends. 

Post September 11

The events of September 11 will certainly put us in a technical recession.
 Now though, we don't expect to see the cash flow contractions and lay
offs draw themselves out for as long a period.  The economic contraction
will now be steeper, but with the bottom reached sooner.  In crisis mode,
Washington is being very proactive at providing stimulus to the economy.
 We don't think this would have been the case outside of a crisis.  A
significant event has provided us with the stimulus for renewed growth.
 We now believe light at the end of the tunnel may appear in the second
quarter of 2002, a modest growth environment to appear in the third quarter
of 2002 and possible robust growth by the end of next year.  The hole
we fall in will be deeper, but now we have much more of a helping hand
from Washington.

The Future

There's a lot we all have to be grateful for at this point in time.  We've
all benefited from a very long expansion period.  We've lived during the
most amazing time in all of human history.  The social, cultural and technologi
cal advances man has made over the last two generations are unparalleled
in history.  We live in a great country where freedom and prosperity have
only grown since our inception.  

Our social consciousness has certainly been violated.  We grieve for all
those who are suffering.  We pray for them, for our families and ourselves.
  We pray for peace and logic to prevail.  

This event provides our country with an opportunity to show the strength
of our character.  We have faith that operating under the veil of our
great value systems, America's leadership will do the best thing for most
all world constituencies.  We will set the best example of fairness, yet
resolve.

The seeds of our next great economic growth cycle have now been planted.
 It is not our technology, or our wealth, or our military strength that
will inspire the world.  It's our value systems that will inspire them.
  Underneath all the trappings of American culture and prosperity are
the foundations of freedom, opportunity, fairness and justice.  These
are the American "products" that inspire the world to emulate us.  Over
time, the world's desire to be more and more like America will drive even
greater demand for everything American.  

We wish everyone well with the challenges ahead.  Fear not, as an even
more fair and honest world, and an even stronger economic growth environment,
are right around the corner.

As we discussed yesterday, the exchange ratio adjusted price comparison is the key ratio to guage market merger appetite.   I also included the ENE 6 5/8% 10/15/03 bond price to view the credit market's perception.
I'll send it around from time to time.  An excel file is attached.

Michael

just a note to the team....the restructuring concept has not yet been presented to Duferco, but will be shortly, and as of  our meeting this morning, Gregg Hermans is tasked with being the single point person from Enron in dealing with Duferco on these issues.

Attached is the updated status of the steel trades/transactions that have potential LOC/cashflow impact in the next few months.  According to Kent, who had a direct conversation with Bowen late yesterday, all new steel trades/structured transactions not yet agreed to will require Bowen approval prior to being reviewed by RAC.  

In summary, the commitment status for the Kibar and EDZK trades is yet to be determined, upon reviewing the taped conversation between the traders and the counterparties.  Duferco payments for the final 100,000 ton slab purchase and the $40,000 option are up for restructuring next week with the company.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.  Thanks.

Coal - Emissions: There is no trading activity & there are a few contract cancellations.

LNG, Freight Markets & Weather: No activity & Virtually all contracts have been canceled.

Global Markets:	Non bankrupt entities are closing positions and selling inventory. Bankrupt entities are doing nothing. Cancellations are being processed and booked.

Today is an important day for ERAC. If we get paid by our counter parties for November business, then we can pay our obligations. If not several companies will follow us into Bankruptsy.

Subject:	Quick Summary

Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back.  Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves.  Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.  Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred.   Legal is deciding difference between "executable" contracts (able to negate deal) and "forward" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale.   South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.

In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking.  However, below is the VAR COB 12/18/01.

	Entity		VAR		Historical VAR
?	Corp		$68.9MM	$60.7MM
?	Americas	$46.5MM	$39.6MM

 Rick:  Are you saying that you just want three DASH categories, i.e. 1) Proceed, 2) Do not Proceed and 3) Returns Below Capital Price  with no category for Issues, RAC Comments, etc.  RC

Subject:	DASH Classification - "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments"

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.     
							Regards!

In case there is any confusion who is your HR contact following the last 2 days headcount reductions, attached is a updated listing. I anticipate we will make further reductions in HR headcount in line with the wind down of operations but will obviously notify you of these ahead of time.

The Asset team under Stan is not listed attached as it remains largely unchanged.

The people listed attached will be lead by Robert Jones, VP of HR.  Robert, Mary Joyce and myself have set up central specialist HR support teams (not listed attached) based on the 16th floor of the old building to ensure that you and your HR leads have the resources and services they need to provide the necessary HR services for ongoing operations. 

 

Please call Robert, Mary or me with any questions.

David

As this may hit the media:


This motion asks for relief from the bankruptcy stay to pursue dispute resolution at CPUC.   We ask that EES and EEMC be allowed to: 

"seek(ing) the restoration of the cumulative unpaid credit balances which previously were present on bills to EES and EEMC rendered by PG&E; and 2) to permit EES and EEMC to deposit monies representing the amount of disputed bills from PG&E with the CPUC pursuant to Rules 10 and 22 of PG&E's applicable tariff."

Our PX credits were removed from the bills late last year.   We have been billed by PG&E for the positive PX credit which is accruing now that we have put customers back on direct access and the "market price" has fallen below the generation portion of the tarriff.   We are asserting a recoupment argument.   The recoupment is ostensibly an offset against amounts which we are owed (negative PX credit).  Persuing this offset essentially liquidates the claim we are owed at 100 cents.

Bill, 

It's about 2.5 million dollars (cash not LC), and this helps us cover a short position we need to cover.  I want to do this deal.

What do you want to about this?  This is tying up capital when we are a little bit short on capital.

John:

Appreciate seeing the old e-mail again, but remind you that the Shenhua cargo was agreed 22 Oct.  As mentioned, we will certainly try to push Shenhua to entertain alternative arrangements, but the Chinese are usually quite difficult on this subject (to date, all Chinese cargoes have required Enron to post an LC).  It's a good idea to get Shankman thinking about this one today, because it is likely that we will need to post an LC for this cargo.  If timing is an issue, I'm sure we can drag the process out a few weeks since delivery is not until mid-Jan.

Regardless, need your input as soon as possible on whether we can continue transacting business where cash collection is not coincident (or in advance of) cash out the door.

Thks,

Stu

Stu - 

As per the e-mail below, RAC must be contacted prior to transacting on an L/C basis.  This was the same message I conveyed to the Australian team early last week.  The Shenhua deal definitely falls within the description and is an issue to be resolved.

I will talk to Jeff Shankman today about the use of L/Cs and capital in the near future, and see what resolution can be reached with the positions and strategy you hold in your book.

In this current climate we should try wherever possible not to commit to posting collateral to counterparties for physical purchases of product unless absolutely necessary.  We should offer an Enron Corp guarantee as an alternative.  In the event that we are asked to post security to a counterparty would you please contact credit before doing so.
The credit hotline number is 36555

thanks for your co-operation.

Hi Rick

I met with Vince Kaminski last week in Houston.  The primary purpose for my
meeting was to introduce Algorithmics to his research team and identify any
opportunities for Algorithmics to add value to Enron's risk management
process.  Our discussion revealed a number of areas which are of interest to
Vince, namely counterparty default data and credit risk calculation
performance.  We agreed that the latter issue warranted a follow up
discussion and I'm working with Vince to co-ordinate this meeting.  As chief
risk officer for Enron, I thought you might find value in our offering, so I
have taken the liberty to send you an information package. Briefly,  Algo
specializes in providing clients with a consistent framework for risk
measurement and management across the entire organization - including
market, credit, liquidity and operational risk.  This is delivered through
our patented Mark-to-Future methodology - a combination of technology and
advanced financial engineering. 

To date we have about 120 clients world-wide (see URL link for details
http://www.algorithmics.com/corporate/clients/index.shtml

Other commodity and energy clients include, PG& E Corp. , Axia Energy,
Cemex, S.A.  Once you've had the opportunity to review the documentation, I
would be happy to   give you a short presentation on our solution. This will
help solidify the concepts illustrated in the information package.  


Best regards,

Peter Antoniadis

Dan,

Rod Hayslett has agreed to support the sale of the Haina note.  Please proceed.

1)	I want a DASH on the transaction.  RAC signoff on any asset sales is policy.  I view the sale of a note as policy.
2)	I want to make sure that Enron is not making any substantive reps or warranties that could bite us.
3)	I want to know who the buyer is.

Steve
 
I have validated the curve shift data against the official internal daily position and p&l reports (which report total p&l) and am generally comfortable with the original curve-shift numbers. The differences betweeen the two are due to the following components of profit and loss, i.e. those which price moves against a day's closing position do not capture:
 
1    Intra day positioning (in the forward and cash markets)
2    New deals against our mid curve
3    Liquidity and other reserve movements
4    Liquidation (i.e. where forward mark-to-market value drops out of the forward book and into cash)
 
The data set you have is the one we use to test the efficacy of our VaR models and I would be cautious in their use for predicting profitability. Hence total p&l is the best indicator since it includes all the value changes in the book. 
 
I imagine you are using some measure of return on risk to predict p&l (RoVaR, for example). We have done similar studies for presentation to our Board, amongst others. Let me know if this analysis would be useful to you - we would be happy to provide it.
 
Regards
David

Please add notes as appropriate.  These are for RAC purposes only and will not be distributed.


Challenge

Appetite for credit capacity is much greater than what is justifiable given credit quality of industry and liquidity of transactions.

Issues

Dearth of liquidity in market (bearing in mind that EIM's purpose is to stimulate liquidity)
Poor credit quality
Highly structured nature of steel transactions (inventory management, illiquid options, etc.)
M-T-M Accounting and incentives related to achieving earnings targets

Short-term Solutions

Consider expanding "risk pool" (with concentration limits) to provide more flexibility to commercial teams (Pitfall:  could be rapidly depleted to achieve short-term budget targets)
Reduce size of transactions and increase volume to achieve greater diversity and less concentration

Action Items

Plan more formal education for Steel Group centered around
M-T-M Accounting
Credit Analysis
Market Risk Analysis
Determination of Credit Lines
Calculating Credit Reserves
Link Budget Process to Credit and Market Risk
More clearly define view of liquidity with regard to different types of transactions/commodities

1=09CEO but leave 3.0 and 1.5 thresholds - if we need to change we'll chang=
e and then BOD can ratify as with other policy changes - they will certainl=
y require some feedback on the metric.
2=09Numerator from Global Finance, not Accounting. FAC and BC as previously=
 defined
3=09I think the PFCR definition is adequate

If our position liquidity horizon is about 10 days it should be revised wee=
kly or when there is a big market move ("weekly or as markets dictate")

RAC should orchestrate the calculation, as a "prototype" which when bedded =
down and stable can be passed to GRMO

Ben/David/Bill -

Please see the what we have for the following policy excerpts at the end of=
 this message, and address the following:

1.=09Advisory Limit Setting - is it by the BOD or by the CEO?  Our presenta=
tion says CEO, but also specifies the trigger as 3.0 for P50 and 1.5 for P9=
9.  If it's CEO level, we don't need to specify in the policy what the trig=
ger limit is, as CEO can change.  If it's in the Policy itself, it's consid=
ered a Board approved limit.=20
a.=09Let's decide - if CEO level, let's change to say "a certain multiple o=
f..." instead of 3.0 and 1.5
b.=09If at Board level,  don't we need to specify a time horizon? If not, w=
hy bother to specify the trigger - if one's going to be at CEO discretion a=
nd consequently not specified in the policy itself, why not all of it?

2.=09Definitions in 3.4 excerpt below - Rick Buy wants these definitions ha=
rd coded and clearly defined in the policy

?=09Future Available Cash -=20
?=09Is this straight off a daily report from Accounting?  What does this # =
represent and what do we want in the policy?
?=09which individual is going to provide this daily, and when? =20
?=09Borrowing Capacity -=20
?=09I defined this by pulling terms straight from the slide in the Joint Au=
dit/Finance Committee presentation - do you agree?
?=09who is going to calculate this daily and provide to RAC, and by when?
?=09Potential Future Cash Requirements -
?=09is this clear enough?  any specific collateral assumptions given contra=
ctual cash posting optionality?  worst case assumption?

3.=09Does RAC really need to calculate this if GRMO is going to report it o=
n the Executive Report Viewer, and the calculations are hard-coded above?  =
Seems like we could implement a process by which the 3 pieces of informatio=
n get fed to GRMO to calculate and report, like all the other market risk m=
etrics.

Please call me in the morning so I can run through any required changes.

Regards,
Cassandra.


3.4=09Risk Measurement for Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk focuses on whether the Company is able to raise enou=
gh capital (whether through debt, equity, or counterparty collateral) to me=
et its cash and collateral requirements, and is a function of funding liqui=
dity and position liquidity.  Margin deposits received and margin deposits =
required under the Company's Trading Portfolio have a significant impact on=
 the Company's funding requirements, and are often determined by changes in=
 commodity prices.  Position liquidity refers to the extent to which a posi=
tion can be liquidated quickly, and in large volume, without substantially =
affecting the position's price.  Key determinants of the liquidity of a pos=
ition and the cost of liquidation include: (a) the level of third-party int=
erest and market activity in the asset, (b) the time period available to co=
nvert the asset to cash, (c) the size (value or volumes) of the asset, and =
(d) perception of the Company in the marketplace.  Active management of fun=
ding requirements and capital availability should minimize funding shortfal=
ls.  See Section 4.4 for the limit structure and reporting guidelines.
The Liquidity Exposure Ratio ("Liquidity Ratio") is the primary metric of t=
he Company's liquidity/funding risk to be implemented under a transition pe=
riod determined by the Risk Management Committee.  The Liquidity Ratio shal=
l be calculated daily over a specified time period by dividing (a) the sum =
of the Company's (i) Future Available Cash and (ii) Borrowing Capacity, by =
(b) the Company's Potential Future Cash Requirements.  Future Available Cas=
h shall represent the Company's current cash-flow forecast as determined by=
 the Accounting department, considering operating and investing activities.=
  Borrowing Capacity shall be determined by the Treasury department, and sh=
all be calculated as the sum of: (a) commercial paper; (b) uncommitted bank=
 lines and loan sales lines; (c) letter of credit facilities; (d) accounts =
receivable; (e) shelf registrations for public debt issues; and (f) shelf r=
egistrations for public equity issues.  Potential Future Cash Requirements =
shall be calculated by the Trading Portfolio's risk systems and shall repre=
sent a simulation of margin exposure and collateral requirements for the Tr=
ading Portfolio.
Liquidity stress testing shall be performed periodically, as determined by =
the Chief Risk Officer, to quantify the liquidity/funding risks associated =
with specific positions.  Such stress testing may include specific asset li=
quidity stress tests to quantify the risks associated with illiquid positio=
ns.  Results of liquidity stress testing will be made available to the CEO =
and to other parties at the discretion of the Chief Risk Officer.

4.4=09Capital Associated with Liquidity/Funding Risk
Liquidity/funding risk arises from the potential that funding requirements =
will exceed funding availability for a given time period.  Funding requirem=
ents may vary over time as a result of: (a) exchange margin requirements, c=
ollateral obligations and collateral receivables primarily related to Tradi=
ng Portfolio activities; (b) new investments; (c) the payment of interest a=
nd dividends; and (d) the maturing of debt and other obligations.  Funding =
availability may vary over time as a result of: (a) available cash; (b) acc=
ess to capital markets; (c) available collateral; and (d) the time required=
 to convert positions to cash or liquid assets.
The Company shall use the Liquidity Ratio, liquidity stress testing and oth=
er methods as specified by the Chief Risk Officer to measure liquidity/fund=
ing risk.
4.4.1=09Limit Structure for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The CEO shall approve an advisory limit for liquidity/funding risk ("Liquid=
ity Ratio Advisory") to be implemented under a transition period approved b=
y the Risk Management Committee.  This shall be based on the Liquidity Rati=
o discussed in Section 3.4 of this Policy.  The Liquidity Ratio shall be ca=
lculated using two different assumptions to calculate Potential Future Cash=
 Requirements, the denominator of the calculation: (a) a 50% confidence lev=
el, and (b) a 99% confidence level.
4.4.2=09Administration/Reporting for Liquidity/Funding Risk
The Liquidity Ratio shall be calculated on a daily basis and reported by GR=
MO to the CEO, the Chief Risk Officer, and the Treasury department designee=
.  If the Liquidity Ratio is (a) less than 3.0 using a 50% confidence level=
 to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements or (b) less than 1.5 using=
 a 99% confidence level to calculate Potential Future Cash Requirements, th=
e Chief Risk Officer shall notify the CEO and others at his discretion.  Th=
e CEO shall direct senior management to take certain actions to mitigate th=
e Company's liquidity/funding risk.

The funerals of Andy, Darren and Paul, who tragically lost their lives in last Wednesday's explosion at Teesside Power Station, will be held this week at the following times:

Andy Sherwood	2.00pm, Wednesday, August 15
St  James Church, Hartlepool

Darren Higgins	9.15 am, Thursday, August 16
St. Andrews Church, Teesville, Middlesbrough

Paul Surtees		1.30 pm, Thursday, August 16
Easington Church of the Ascension, Easington Colliery

We know that everyone at Enron will want to remember the colleagues we have lost at this difficult time, and our thoughts and prayers are with their families and friends.

We are considering how best to commemorate the lives of Andy, Darren and Paul, and will be discussing our ideas with their families, in due course.

Graeme White is recovering in Middlesbrough General Hospital where his condition remains stable and we are continuing to provide as much support as possible for Graeme and his family.

The plant remains off-line and Enron continues to co-operate fully with the Health & Safety Executive's investigation into the cause of the explosion.

John Sherriff and Michael Brown

Hi Vince & Rick, attached is a resume of a friend of mine from when I worked in NYC.  This guys has MIT Aerospace background but has extensive trading and risk management experience--one of those with commercial and technical experience.  He is an excellent team player with great personality as far as working in stressed and dynamic environment goes. He will do well at Enron.  I think he is ready to try Houston like I did as he is ready to raise a family.

Please forward to appropriate parties if there are no immediate opportunities.

Regards,



Ravi Thuraisingham, CFA

I reveiwed the attached draft of the document for Project Green Light with Rick Buy today just to let him know that this has taken shape since he and I discussed this in August.  He asked that I forward a draft to each of you.  Please let Tom know if you have suggestions or comments.  Steve Stock is in London this week, and will be meeting with IT personnel and with Mike Jordan regarding this project.  Upon Steve's return, the plan is that Tom will be able to complete this document with a planned timeline.  Watch for this in final form next week.  --Sally

Dave:

I read Gordon Bethune's comments is the Chronicle this morning and if he concerned about Continental's solvency, the other carriers must be even more at risk.   As Bill and I are traveling, could you help in asking for a recap of our Airline positions?   We probably should identify the universe of names.   Given the high operating leverage in this industry, coupled with lease leverage, it does not take much to go negative.   For United and American I would imagine access to CP and revolvers would be potentially problematic.   I will be Bill at about 6:45 before we leave, if this is already in process, I'll leave a voice mail.

Regards,

Michael

Paul Flack asked me to ask each of you if you have received any materials relating to lawsuits about which you have not yet informed us.  Paul's question arises from our learning about a motion that was filed in federal court in Texarkana in a case styled Davis, et al. v. Enron, et al., in which you were named as defendants, and about which we have received no prior notice.
 
Thank you for your assistance.

Ted, 

In addition to the $57,000 paid by Enron to the IRS, you will also have UK taxes paid by Enron to offset your US tax liability.  Most of the imputed income items relates to UK taxes ($220,000), which will be available for use as a credit against any US liability that you have.  $82,000 of the imputed items relates to housing, which also gets exluded under section 911 of the IRS code.  The housing exclusion is in addition to your usual income exclusion.  

In addition to the payments that have been made and amounts imputed, Enron still intends to tax equalize you for 2001.  

The $57,000 is the US FIT that has been paid to the IRS on your behalf.  Regarding your UK taxes, Madeline Fox is working to finalize the information for all the expats in the UK.  

Regarding PwC, they probably only meant that they are done with the tax returns for Enron's expats for this year.  We have prepaid PwC's services for the 2001 US tax year and the 2001/2002 UK tax year.  You will be contacted as usual in early 2002 regarding your tax return assistance.

Thanks,

Mike

Tim,
I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08 
Taxes withheld = $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.  

I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not doing any work for Enron at the moment.

Ted

Rick - this is the event that Cal Payne spoke to you about several weeks
ago.  He indicated to me that you would be interested in attending.



I am David Johnson - a partner with Andersen and we are sponsoring the Risk
Officers Roundtable.  This is not a training seminar or an event with an
audience.  This group has been meeting for a couple of years and recently
asked Andersen to take the lead in facilitating the group.  The objective
of this group is to focus on issues that each of you are facing as risk
officers or leading energy trading organizations.  The ideas and issues
dicussed will remain confidential.  This is a forum for people facing
similar issues to bounce ideas off of each other and to discuss topics of
mutual interest.  From an anti-trust perspective, competitive approaches as
an industry or similar initiatives will not be discussed.  The group will
meet about 4 times a year

Our plans for the next meeting are as follows:

Location  - Las Vegas (Bellagio currently has rooms for $129/night)

Date - Monday November 12 and Tuesday November 13

Agenda - We will get with each attendee and formulate an agenda.  This will
be circulated prior to the meeting.

Attendees -  Confirmed - Eddie Meche, Reliant, Philip Chesson - Williams,
Glen Labhart - Dynegy, Cal Payne - UtiliCorp
Invitations extended to Rick Buy - Enron, Rich Osborne - Duke, Mark Randle
- Sempra and Bob Andersen - ElPaso.

The group will be limited to these indivuduals unless the participants
desire to add other indivuduals to the mix.

If you have any questions, please call me at 713.237.2351.

Please let me know if you will be available to attend.  The date is drawing
near and we need to finalize plans.

J.C. asked that I send you the following message:

In light of rumors that investigations into Enron's financial difficulties may be launched or expanded, including investigations by the civil plaintiffs or by the FBI on behalf of the SEC or Congress, we believe it prudent to advise you that if anyone contacts you and seeks to question you (even someone with a badge and an authoritative demeanor), don't answer their questions. Refer them to us for the purpose of arranging an interview.

Second, if you know of any individuals who you believe might be interviewed in connection with these investigations, please call us so we can discuss how such information should be forwarded to the appropriate people.

Please call if you have any questions.

SCA is pleased to inform you there are still available seats in an upcoming "Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation" class scheduled in Houston, Texas on October 30-31, 2001.  The class will be held at SCA's offices, 2500 Tanglewilde, Suite 120, from 8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m., Tuesday and Wednesday. Below is the description of the course.

Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation
A Must Course for Anyone who Generates or Evaluates Interpretations and Prospects!!!


Description:
                    This course addresses the need for a systematic approach for quickly screening prospects and identifying fundamental mapping errors. The application of the methods used in our Applied Subsurface Geological Mapping course as quick look techniques is the core of this course. The most common errors found on subsurface prospects are illustrated with numerous examples from throughout the industry.
                    It's easy to drill a dry hole on a good prospect; it only has to be mapped a little bit wrong. QLTs are powerful and efficient tools for recognizing sometimes subtle mapping errors that lead to poorly located drilling locations. 
                    The course begins with a review of examples of mapping errors that lead to poorly located wells that were uneconomic or dry. Methods used to address the risk factors that can cause dry holes are reviewed. Specific QLTs that can be used to identify critical mapping errors are covered in the remainder of the course. The course manual is our textbook, "Quick Look Techniques for Prospect Evaluation."

Who should attend?
                    Supervisors, managers, vice-presidents, prospect evaluators, and anyone involved in preparing, reviewing or evaluating subsurface interpretations and prospects.  Attendees who have a background  knowledge of  mapping  techniques will  derive a  more  complete  benefit from this course.

As you are aware, we are in the process of rescheduling the Enron Corp. Board of Directors meeting.  Due to the proximity of the Holidays we will hold committee meetings and Board meeting on the same day. 

Therefore, please let us know today the minimum amount of time you would need for your respective committee meetings.  

Please be aware that some of our Directors will be joining the meeting via teleconference and we will therefore need to do all mail outs at least one week in advance.

As soon as we have a firm date for the Board meeting, we will advise you.

Thank you.

Below please find a summary of recommendations from a meeting held Tuesday between Chip Schneider, Joe Deffner and Wes Colwell.  It is contemplated that these or similar recommendations will be implemented to control capital and other expenditures related to transaction development within the Americas:

Regional Managers within the Americas (East, West, Canada, Mexico, South America) shall be generally accountable for capital expenditures and other expenses associated with transaction development in their respective regions.
The Regional Manager shall designate one Transaction Leader (Director level or higher) for each individual transaction under consideration and shall be accountable to the Regional Manager.  The Transaction Leader or Regional Manager shall be the only parties authorized to obligate Enron or its affiliates under any contract or to transfer money.
Legal shall provide copies of all draft documents to Accounting, Global Finance and Underwriting.
The Deal Leader shall be responsible for drafting initial DASH, seeking buy-in from management and establishing a time-table for expenditure approval.
The initial draft of the DASH and economic model shall be provided to Underwriting at least ten business days prior to any movement of money (more time may be necessary if financing or ENE BoD approval is required).
Legal shall provide a final Legal Risk Memorandum to Underwriting prior to circulation of DASH.
Global Finance shall provide a final FASH to Underwriting prior to circulation of DASH.
Underwriting shall be responsible for DASH circulation.
Underwriting shall promptly provide Accounting with fully executed DASH to set approved budget limits.
Accounting shall keep records of all expenditures, maintain responsibility for approved budget compliance and sign-off on all contracts and money transfers prior to execution.

Let me know what further thoughts you have.

i hoped that would be your response - i had let Lavo know i would frame a case for him - but i think we need to get it to the point where somebody other than me tells him its not a good idea.

I don't think the BOD would be comfy with this suggestion. Lets discuss when I return. Rick

Subject: Limit Revision - Enron Americas



Rick - further to our discussion, here is the change Enron Americas are requesting in their limit structure: 

Eliminate volumetric limits on net open position and maturity gap; 
Eliminate limits on individual commodities within the business unit; 
Replace with one limit, expressed in VaR, for the entire business unit, of $100MM. 


I am not uncomfortable with $100MM, given the opportunity set and the required returns from this activity. ETL at this level could be in the region of $340MM.

I think the other things to consider in making the decision are as follows: 

Does the VaR tell us sufficient about the risk ? 

I think it does since we have the ability to see components of it in some detail and it backtests well 

Tail Risks 

Generally we have the most data on tail risks for US gas and power and we are most confident about the EVaR and ETL measures for these commodities.

Liquidity 

This should be a key point in removing volumetric limits because they give us a concept of size. Our recent analysis has shown that our ability to unload risk in US natural gas certainly is high (50% reduction, 10 days) - but we need to continually revisit this analysis.

Administration of Risk 

Generally I think we are comfortable - deal capture is good since so many trades are picked up through EOL. 
Delegation of authority using VaR limits at desk level is strong 

But since VaR is so dependent on MTM values and curves I would still recommend a review of: 

curve validation results; 
ageing of confirmations outstanding (in and out); 
flash to actual differences (if any) 


Compliance with Policy 

The policy requires limits under the business unit by "commodity groups" in some combination of volumetric and VaR limits. We also must approve products/commodities for a business unit.

One interpretation of this is to define the commodity "group" as the aggregate of gas, power, coal, crude, and approve those products, in which case the aggregate limit for the business unit is the commdity group limit also - so we can have one limit. 

Our concern about the Firm blowing up because everyone is short crude, for example, is covered by the fact that we can still see all the components of our aggregate risk to a single commodity, which is also capped by the concentration limits. The only question is from a governance standpoint, how you prevent yourself bumping up against those and having to explain it to the board.

Another side of this argument is the "10K analogy" - if I put $100MM into my 10K via a mutual fund I am likely to want them to declare in which markets they invest it.

To summarize, I think we could justify losing volumetric limits for this business. On the question of level of risk and commodity limits, I think we should talk it over with Greg / Ken.

The 2002 Enron Net Works budget will for the first time combine allocations to business units for four key services:  Enron Online, IT Infrastructure, Risk Management Operations and IT Maintenance and Development.  We are providing a level of detail for expense and capital spend that is greater than that provided in past years, and that will allow business units to make informed choices regarding the services that they receive.  

We are meeting with individual business unit Offices of the Chair to review in detail the four service areas delivered through Enron Net Works.  Some of these meetings have been completed and more will occur between now and October 12.  Please keep the following points in mind as we work with you to finalize budget:

Enron Networks today is very different from this time last year.  Additions to the 2002 ENW budget are Operations for EA, EIM and EGM.  Operations, IT Maintenance and Development, and IT Infrastructure for EES and EBS have been included under the ENW umbrella for the first time in the  2002  budget as well.  The 2001 budgets for these functions were approved and included in individual business units last year.   Any comparison of ENW's 2002 versus 2001 budget must be appropriately adjusted for these organizational changes to be relevant.  

For further detail for each business unit, ENW's 2002 expense and capital dollars are organized to mirror each business unit's lines of business (products or commodities) in order to create a transparent view at a more granular level of the costs involved in supporting each of the lines of business.  

The detail that is being provided to business units for IT costs delineates licensing fees, system maintenance costs and new development costs.  Detail on each IT development project identifies the purpose, business sponsor, line of business, "in progress" or "planned" designation, expense and capital spend, system impacted, and estimated completion date.   In order to finalize IT project budgets, decisions will be required from the business units on which projects to undertake in 2002.   

If you have questions about the ENW budgets as we are working with you to finalize them,  please call one of us.

The court held a hearing today on the motion by some of the plaintiffs for an order regarding the preservation of documents. The motions were directed primarily to Arthur Andersen and, to a lesser degree, to Enron. None of your names were mentioned at the hearing. 
Arthur Andersen and one of the plaintiffs' lawyers had agreed on a proposed order for preserving documents. Other plaintiffs' lawyers said that the agreed order was not stringent enough. 
With respect to Enron, there is some doubt as to whether the court can enter any order regarding Enron, because that may be the exclusive purview of the bankruptcy court. 
Although the issue of which attorney should be appointed lead counsel was not technically before the court, most of the hearing was consumed with the various plaintiffs' lawyers arguing that the court should select them to be lead counsel. 
The court said that it would not rule on the motion regarding preservation of documents until after 3:00 tomorrow. All of the plaintiffs' lawyers are to get together in the next 24 hours to see if they can agree amongst themselves as to what they want the court to do. The court said she would also consider whether Arthur Andersen was willing to agree to whatever order plaintiffs' all might agree upon.
The judge suggested that she would be selecting the lead plaintiff (and counsel) within the next few weeks.

John's number is 203.622.6409

I enjoyed lunch.  Let's do it again but have some margaritas.

Too bad about the write-off but I did enjoy the LJM story in the WSJ.

1	Limits. Here's how I interpreted the BOD approvals:

The BOD approved an aggregate of $150MM, with $50MM of discretionary VaR, plus the new policy which doesn't recognise the concept of discretionary VaR. So here's what I did:

Effectively I allocated all the $50MM of discretionary such that Pug's "Big Buckets" are now as follows:

US Gas				$100MM
US Elec				$100MM
Europe Gas & Elec			$35MM
Global Products			$20MM
Financials				$15MM
Emerging Businesses		$20MM

If you have a calculator handy you'll see that this aggregates to $149.164MM (assuming zero correlation). 

At Business Unit level the individual commodity limits are unchanged, and I have put limits over the Business Units themselves as follows:

Enron Americas				$82MM
EWS OOC (aka George Martingale)	$3MM 
EEL					$34MM
EGM					$23MM
EIM					$8MM
EBS					$4MM
PGE					$4MM
ETS					$1MM

Again I used root-sum-of-squares, and remember the original commodity limits (by VaR, net open and mat gap) are still in place (e.g. gas = $61MM as before). So that keeps it screwed down pretty tight and preserves the discretion between the "Big Buckets" and the Business Units.

I spoke to Rebecca C who could only remember the decision outlined above, but offered to call Pug and let him know. I said I would come back on that. I think we should do that ourselves, possibly with Lay in the loop (?).

Cleared it with Whalley today (he laughed), mentioned the dwindling membership of the Risk Management Committee and said "In my current role I think I should be asking for limits, not approving them"

...and then...

2	The gas desk lost $98MM yesterday

A combination of a very bullish AGA number (3 Bcf injection - not a typo - three Bcf !) plus some hurricane activity in the gulf sent prices up by between 25 and 30c all across the strip. The long and the short of it was we are long Nov - Jan but short (big-time) out beyond that - the rest is arithmetic.

So we have two flavors of P&L notification, one at the business unit level (Americas) $89MM loss against VaR limit of $82MM; the other as a commodity, losing $126MM (the desk aren't the only ones with a gas position, as usual) against the Big Bucket number of $100MM. Total trading was a loss of $106MM against a VaR limit of $150MM so no calls to Pug required (thank goodness).

That's it for now, hope you're having fun and remember: pan-fry the big ones and throw back the little ones.

At the all-employee meeting two weeks ago, I talked about the major challenges that I believe Enron is currently facing and what we are doing to address these issues.  I also reviewed with you our vision for Enron to become "The World's Leading Company," and what that means to me.

Your management team and I remain committed to this goal and are confident that by working together, we can achieve this vision.  After the all-employee meeting, a number of you came forward to voice your concerns about what you saw as additional challenges for Enron, and for that, I thank you.  We have already begun working on many of the concerns you expressed.  Now, I would like to hear from more of you about what you see as the most critical issues facing Enron in the next twelve months.  In other words, "Lay It on the Line" for me by completing the attached survey.

I assure you that your individual answers to this survey will remain confidential.  The new Management Committee will use this information to help us identify immediate action steps to address your key concerns.  We will communicate the results to you, both positive and negative, and what we plan to do about them, as soon as we can.  Thank you in advance for taking the time to help us move Enron toward its new vision of becoming "The World's Leading Company."

We need your answers no later than Tuesday, September 4, 2001.

To access the survey, click on or copy the following URL onto the Enron intranet site: <http://etcsurvey.corp.enron.com/wi/p0731404/i.asp>.  If this link does not work, go to home.enron.com under "New & Notable" and click on "Lay It On the Line."  If you have problems with the survey, contact the HRGIM Help Desk at 713-853-5666.

Rick:

I am back in London now.  I finish a project this week w/ a unit of Shell.
I have another project teed up for next week where I am working w/ a
'E-Acumen' a energy risk mgmt software co. who is doing an deployment at
TXU.  This co has an interesting product set, simulation/optimization of
portfolios including the asset side of the biz, and they are based in
Boulder/San Fran.  I also know there is some termoil and they may need a new
CEO soon.  Any interest ?

Otherwise, lets continue brainstorming.#

Good luck with your issues at hand.

Rick,

I have spent some time reviewing the allocation of PGE's VaR and net open position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to better match the limits and their objectives to PGE's trading activity and portfolio.  I have discussed these changes with Rod Hayslett and he has concurred with my proposal.  I have also reviewed them with Vlady .

1.  VaR:  Given that PGE is a naturally short utility and does not hedge its long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons, I propose that PGE reallocate $500k of its regulated electric VaR to its regulated natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of PGE's natural short position in the back-end of its reporting period. After reducing PGE's electric VaR it will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated electric portfolio.

2. NOP:  After changing PGE's regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently PGE has been using a 10 Bcf limit for its NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR I've recalculated  the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.

If you agree with these changes please let me know.  If you have any questions please contact me at (503) 464-2723.

Thanks.

Rick,
What do you think...do you want me to order the Astros Playoff tickets?   Also, Wanda Curry has 4 of these tickets that she brought with her from EES by way of ECT. Do you want to order her tickets too or just give them back to EES?   She wanted me to ask you first before giving EES the chance for the tickets.

Project OZ
 
The deal team is proceeding post-haste to draft a definitive term sheet.
 
Bjorn - you're correct - term is now 8 years likely to be 10
 
$40 million working capital facility - advance rate will exceed market - i.e. a portion of this is really equity
 
crack spreads - will be widened (still fine tuning)
 
Minimum investment case  - Morgan Stanley bridge, refinery cash flow to supply capex for Tier 2 upgrades, current volumes
 
After closing, to continue investigating expansion (max capex case) with [option] to hedge larger volumes ( ?- what if we don't agree with expansion plans)
 
RAC draft DASH with deal team's comments expected back this afternoon - will circulate
 
promised model by EOD tomorrow
 
 
anticipate that deal team will try to get approval delegation at the next BOD meeting (about ten days to get thru RAC process)

Rick,
I wanted to summarize for you my budget meeting with Michael on Wed.  I will send you the whole pack under separate cover, but here are the highlights:
	Relatively speaking, it was constructive - he has made unequivical cut demands of other groups

	Original (adjusted) headcount budget for 2001 was 52, he is asking me to freeze heads at current 44 
					which includes: not replacing recent leaver - Karin Levin
							not replacing scheduled Houston rotation - Oliver Harrison
							Scheduled new arrrivals	- John Collenette, Karl Sees, Blair Van Zant, Adam Bauer, Michel Gantois
							Tracy Ngo, plus 5 new in last month.
	2002 budget looks much larger than 2001, despite lower headcount due to: $1.6MM increase due to full costing of expats @ salary plus 4x salary (instead of just 											salary)
										$500k for communications allocated
										increase in benefit costs from 10% to 23%
	All other expenses lowered - 


Budget not finalized. Michael requested: reduce Travel by a significant amount ($100k?)
					get more precise justification of allocations from RAC Corp - 
						Credit - $350k looks a little low (includes you, bill, debbie, credit reserve,CAS..)
						Market - $660 looks a little high/ok
						UndWr - $499 looks too high
						Portfolio - $108 ??
					be prepared to shed under 2 scenarios a) 5 heads
										b) 10 heads
5 heads can be accomodated with little change in service, provided we continue to shed 'operational' credit responsibility and the current low level of large underwritten transactions and revals.
Specific coverage holes and weakness will continue to be: EBS, German speaking credit person, depth in international markets, depth in market risk management.

10 heads would be quite disruptive and my recommendation would be to re-assess the role of RAC with an eye towards much less process work and immunity from finger pointing.

Budget to be finalized a more comprehensive business review is completed over the coming few weeks.

Perhaps we can discuss next week after you have reviewed.

Ted

After close discussions with David Port and the RAC-Market Risk group, we have redesigned the Business Unit and Commodity DPR's to follow the new Risk Trading Policy.  This new policy took effect Wednesday, the 15th of August, and required a restructuring of the Business Unit structures and associated limits, along with creation of new Concentration limits on the Concentration DPR, formerly the Commodity DPR.

For any questions about the new format, please contact Shona Wilson, x39123, or myself, x33102, in the Global Risk Operations group, or David Port, x39823, in the RAC-Market Risk group.

Thank you,

Chris Abel

You're on your way to more efficient and effective meetings 	
  <http://e-meetings.wcom.com/images/orange_bar.gif>	


Did you resolve to improve productivity, cut down on travel, or to spend more time with family members and friends in 2002? Audioconferencing just might be your solution. But, audioconferencing isn't always as simple as it seems. Consider the following tips when you pick up the phone for that next meeting. 

Leader	

Pick an appropriate time for the meeting. Avoid lunchtime hours, if possible. 
Be prompt and end on time. 
Conduct a roll call. 
For large audiences, use Listen Only mode, which mutes all participants until they're queued to talk. Also use an attended service level, which offers a conference coordinator to help manage the call. 
To share a PowerPoint presentation, use Net Conferencing. Participants view the presentation on the Web while listening to you on an audioconference. You control the pace of the presentation and it ensures that participants don't jump ahead. 
If a follow-up meeting is required, select a mutual time and date before the call is over. Follow-up via e-mail. 

Leader & Participants	

Speak clearly and avoid outside conversations or background noise. 
Identify yourself by name when speaking and address other individuals by name. 
Use your voice effectively; vary the tone and pace. 
Use the mute button if you are not speaking. If you do not have access to a mute button, press *6 on your telephone keypad to mute and unmute yourself. 

Receive a Free Web RSVP!
Effective February 1, schedule a domestic attended-level audioconference or Net conference, add Instant Replay PlusSM, and you'll receive a free Web RSVP -- up to $100!* Instant Replay Plus allows individuals who missed your meeting access to a digital recording that they can listen to at their convenience. Web RSVP is our Internet-based registration tool that allows conference leaders to collect and view participant information online. Check out our Web site for more information!

FYI
The curve - shift P&L information that is used in the VaR model for backtesting comes from the business units. Under the "garbage in, garbage out" rule we therefore have had some errors in the backtest data. However, the errors do not significantly affect the backtest result (i.e. it still backtests ok), but they do cast doubt on the P&L numbers that have been submitted.

John,

This file gives you similar information to the file that Jeff sent you for gas.  Frank is using it to continue investigating what went wrong with the extraction from the VaR model.  If you want me to change anything, let me know.

 

Thanks,
Stacey

With the U.S. dollar weaking over the last month vs. most major currencies, and forecasts for it to continue to do so, (which is clearly helpful to Enron while we try to sell international assets), I was wondering if we should think about selling some long dated (6 month-to 1 year depending on when we think we could actually sell something) OTC F/X or Euro calls.  (Or sell calls and buy puts with the proceeds.

Any thoughts?

Jeff

As many of you remember, one of our RAC employees was flooded out of their house in June.  This flood severely damaged their house and ruined virtually all of their belongings inside the house.  Many of you generously donated cash, clothing, and toiletries which were immediately forwarded to the family.  Your generosity and responsiveness in their time of need was greatly appreciated.  They have been working hard to rebuild their house since June and are finally close to moving back home.  We are seeking your help again in donating ANY home furnishings you can.  Our goal is to collect as many items as we can.  If this family cannot use an item, maybe one of their neighbors can.  Here are some of the items we have collected so far:

washer & dryer			Richard Lauer
breakfast room table & chairs 	Stephanie McGinnis
console TV			Cassandra Alston
CD & tape player		Adam Watts
couch & tv stand			Rick Bittner
kitchen housewares galore!	Karen Barbour
Nintendo 64			Christine and Stephanie Barbour (Karen's kids)
VCR, pictures for walls		Stephanie McGinnis
boy's bicycle and rollerblades	Lynn Bellinghausen

We will be renting a moving truck on Saturday, November 2nd to pick up donations and deliver them to this RAC family.  If you can bring your donations to the office, please call me and I will hold in my garage until our November 2nd delivery date.  If you would like for me to pick up your donations at your house, please let me know what your donation will be and your home address so I can map my route and give you an estimated pickup time.  

Thank you kindness and I look forward to hearing from you.
Stephanie

With the Dynegy announcement on November 9th, the U.S Trustee's office removed Enron from the PG&E Official Unsecured Creditor's Committee.  Dynegy is already on the Committee.    

Important hearings in the PG&E bankruptcy are scheduled for December.   These hearings should begin to vet the issue of preemption, or the ability of the federal bankruptcy court to preempt state law under the bankruptcy code, thus freezing out the CPUC from ruling on the transfer of PG&E's generating assets to FERC jurisdiction. 

We continue settlement discussions PG & E.   Including offsets in our trading contracts, our net nominal exposure to PG&E is $511 million.    The claim is disputed primarily due to the pending FERC refund case.       In initial discussions, Enron offered a $85 million discount.    PG&E has countered with a $237 million discount, a $152 million gap.  We are meeting with the company in an attempt to narrow the difference.

Southern California Edison (SCE) has broken off settlement negotiations.   The are forwarding a position that the Direct Access customers should pay a share of the IOU's undercollection, even though many Direct Access customers were sourcing their power via ESP's at that time.    Enron Government Affairs believes that the CPUC is behind SCE's position.   This regulatory scheme would have Enron owing SCE money on a net basis.

The Power Exchange (PX) Bankruptcy continues.   Enron has taken a visible role on the PC Official Unsecured Creditors Committee.     A liquidating plan in the bankruptcy should be filed shortly.

Rick, attached is the historical RAC headcount information you requested for the budget presentation.  

Mercy told me your portion of the presentation has been pushed back to next week so I will also deliver a hard copy of this when you get back to town.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Wanda

I believe this will give us a good sense of the validity of the information we rely on to make the assessments about risk that we are expected to make. I have mentioned this concept before - I envisioned an application (possibly using our 3d tools) that would allow an interested user to assess data flow visually, similar to the way we control our physical assets and commodity flow at ETS, for example.

The other key techniques whose results I believe we need comfort on are the "flash-to-actual" reconciliations, the process of tracking and chasing confirmations and perhaps cash collection/payment analyses. I think you may have included these in your point "4", these all point in some way to the efficacy of the mark-to-market results (which underpin most of the risk metrics we utilize), and trends in them, (or an absence of the analysis altogether), can indicate impending "controls" issues of the type we have witnessed here - so I'm a big fan.

Let me know if you need anything further from me.

Subject:	Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

Moody's Downgrades Mariner Energy's Sub Notes To Caa2


Dow Jones & Company, Inc. -- December  3, 2001


     Following is a press release from Moody's Investors Service:

    New York, December 03, 2001 -- Moody's Investor's Service downgraded to
Caa2
from B3 the rating on Mariner Energy Inc.'s (Mariner) $100 million 10.5%
senior
subordinated notes due 2006. Moody's also downgraded Mariner's senior
implied
rating to B3 from B1 and its unsecured issuer rating to Caa1 from B2.
Moody's
does not rate the company's $150 million senior secured credit facility
maturing
October 2002.

    The ratings outlook is negative, reflecting uncertainty regarding the
effect
of Enron's bankruptcy on Mariner.

    The ratings downgrades reflect the absence of potential support from
Enron
going forward. Mariner's ratings had incorporated continuing implied support
from Enron while Mariner grew its size relative to the scale of its business
risks and capital requirements. Enron indirectly owns 96% of the firm
through
Joint Energy Development Investments LP (JEDI), and indirectly contributed
about
$130 million in equity during 1998-2000. Mariner's credit facility and
subordinated notes are non-recourse to Enron and do not cross-default with
Enron
obligations.

    Through 9/30/01, Mariner sold 38% of its oil and gas production to Enron
under
one to three month production contracts. Receivables from these sales were
$2.7
million at 9/30/01. Mariner also has commodity price hedges with Enron
through
2003. The value of these contracts was approximately $28 million at 9/30/01.
A
portion of these contracts was settled subsequent to 9/30/01, and commodity
prices have improved slightly since 9/30/01, causing the value of these
contracts to decline.

    Mariner's ratings assume that the company operates as an entity
independent
from Enron. The ratings reflect a small, concentrated and comparatively
short-
lived reserve base; the company's exploration focus on deepwater plays in
the
Gulf of Mexico (GOM), which have relatively large up front costs; high
leverage
on the reserve base; and relatively high full cycle unit costs.

    The scale of the front-end exploration and development costs associated
with
Mariner's operations is large relative to Mariner's size, and there are
significant time lags prior to commencement of production. Mariner's proved
reserves totaled 34 mmboe as of 12/31/00, with PD reserves at only 16 mmboe.
The
large PUD component, representing over 50% of proved reserves, requires
significant capex to bring to production, and the reserve life is short, at
about 5 years (less than 3 years on PD reserves).

    Mariner's deep water oriented business strategy and limited scale result
in a
concentrated reserve base, with the company's top nine properties
representing
93% of 12/31/00 reserves. Overall production and reserve movements can be
lumpy
and susceptible to delay and operational risks at an individual property,
while
the short life of the reserve base compounds the challenge of growing
reserve
mass and sustaining production levels. Mariner expects to diversify its
reserve
base over time by increasing activity in the shelf/shallow GOM, but over the
near term the reserve base is expected to remain relatively small,
concentrated,
and comparatively short-lived.

    Mariner's debt on proved developed (PD) reserves has declined from over
$10/
boe in early 2000, but remains high, at about $6.30/PD boe and is not
expected
to decrease significantly over the near term. Continuing heavy capex
requirements are expected to require revolver drawings in 2002, and if Enron
fails to make payments under Mariner's commodity hedges, additional drawings
may
be required to make up for the lost cash flow. Currently, Mariner's
revolving
credit ($65 million borrowing base, after the November 2001 sale of
Aconcagua)
is undrawn and proceeds from the sale of Aconcagua provide near term
liquidity
for 4Q01 capex. The revolver expires in October 2002, and Mariner expects to
extend it in early 2002.

    Mariner's production has been decreasing in 2001 (from 19 mmboe/d in
1Q01 to
16 mmboe/d in 3Q01). However, Mariner expects to start production at King
Kong
and Yosemite by the end of 2001, which would add to 12/31/01 PD reserves and
support production growth during 2002.

    Mariner's full cycle leveraged unit cost structure is relatively high.
At
average unhedged realizations of $22.20 in 3Q01, Mariner's leveraged unit
margin
(including about $1.85/boe of interest expense) would have been slightly
below
average historic unit reserve replacement costs. In a sustained period of
weak
commodity prices, the company's liquidity may become strained, given its
heavy,
front-ended capex and the short life of its reserve base.

    Mariner Energy is an independent oil and gas exploration and development
company, with headquarters in Houston, Texas, and principal operations in
the
Gulf of Mexico and Gulf Coast area.

Ray,

We are working on revising the DASH template in order that it can be readily used for asset divestitures, contract terminations, and amendments to transactions.  The new DASH, the template of which should be completed early next week, would be prepared earlier in the process that was typically the case in the past, would contain a RAC recommendation, and would then be used as the approval document for the appropriate committee (Transaction Review or Bankruptcy Management) to recommend or approve a transaction.  This is consistent with past practice (although presumably only business unit, RAC, and legal sign-offs would occur prior to committee review) and with your memo of earlier today.

Your thoughts as to how the approval process should occur after a DASH is prepared would be appreciated.

Regards,

Dave

 To all,

I again want to reiterate that the initiative to reconcile at a high level across all risk applications (DPR, VAR CAS and Infinity) is not incremental to the GRMO initiatives to look at the interfaces between the source systems and risktRAC and make the appropriate updates, it will probably be just a first step.  It is evident that not everyone has been aware this reconciliation is not being performed.  Without this reconciliation, the integrity of the daily risk data will continue to be in question.  In reality, we may be closer than we think. We simply do not know. 

To highlight the need for this reconciliation, I will summarize the discussions from the meeting this morning.  No exceptions were reported.   However, VAR for EES changed materially from the day before causing the Market Risk group to question the results.  It was determined that EES Enpower feeds into RisktRAC  were counted twice (for either West or East) for the calculation of VAR.  Also it was reported, as a result of book name changes last evening, a book (one book,  two different names) was sent to Infinity twice. 

These are just two examples of the unlimited number of items that could cause an error.  The current exception reporting is narrowly focused and can never be broad enough to eliminate the need for a reconciliation.  Also, this reconciliation will help identify the origin of problems.  

I hope this helps explain my desire to move forward quickly.   In order to accomplish this,  we need to tap the individuals with the greatest insight into this complex process for guidance, and then utilize others resources to execute.  

I will be glad to discuss this with each of you.  Beth and Shona, I will schedule a meeting with both of you to review what approach would be best prior to scheduling the large group meeting.  

Thanks.  I look forward to working with you on this initiative.

Wanda

I agree we need to have a meeting prior to the large group meeting.  As I stated below, I will work on an agenda and presentation which I review with you and Beth, but I want to get this larger meeting on everyone's calendar.  Do you agree these are the right people?   I am still optimistic a tie out can be accomplished without major changes to any systems, and the information obtained will be a diagnostic tool for the initiative below (where are the problems/disconnects?).   This step is critical in determining the scope and urgency of the initiative to improve  daily roll-up processes (you never know, all systems may actually by in-sync!).   It is also an opportunity to quickly access the results of the current process, which may improve management's opinion re the accuracy of the daily information.

Call me, let's discuss. 


Thanks,
Wanda

Dear Wanda,

I think a good idea would be to have a pre-kick off meeting with Beth and I first so we can discuss what is currently taking place in regards to GRMO initiatives in this area.  We (Sally, Bob, Beth, Debbie etc) had a meeting yesterday to look at the interfaces between the source systems and risktRAC and make the appropriate updates.  I also had a conversation with Sheila today to ensure Infinity is scoped in to this process.

Do you want me to set up a meeting?

Thanks

Shona,

 As per my memo to you on August 13th, I am scheduling a kick-off meeting with individuals to discuss a daily tie-out process across all global risk applications/reports, i.e. DPR, Infinity, RisktRAC (VAR and Benchmark) and CAS.  This would provide proof (or a trail to what is missing)  that required information from all risk books, commodities, and business units are appropriately reported on a daily basis.  As stated earlier, without a robust global books application, the daily process currently in place provides little assurance that "everything" rolls up correctly.  It also does not include Infinity.  


My suggestion for attendance at this meeting, in addition to you, Beth and I, is as follows:

	Stacey White
	Todd Hall
	Sheila Glover/Clara Carrington
	Kevin Sweeney
	Kristin Albrecht
	Mike Jordan
	Jeff Gossett
	Scott Mills
	Ramesh Ganapathy
	Debbie Brackett

Please let me know today if you agree with this list and I will move forward getting the meeting scheduled and work on a presentation/agenda for you and Beth to approve.  

Thanks for your help.

Wanda

Ryan,

In the follow up to the meeting we had on Wednesday I would like
to reinforce one point I made. I feel strongly that I cannot support
the valuations my group has produced so far for the LJM/Raptor
related transactions without examination of all the related legal documents.

I feel that we did solid work based on verbal information,  but I cannot
guarantee the quality of the final product without looking at the contracts.
These transactions are too complex and controversial to bypass due diligence requirements 
that you would expect from any professional.

Vince Kaminski

Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

?=09The emerging debt markets were less volatile this week following the st=
abilization in the Argentine financial sector. Although there was no real p=
rogress in improving the country's fundamentals, international reserves and=
 private sector deposits stopped falling, generating positive momentum for =
the market. As a result, Argentina broke through an important 1400 resistan=
ce level this week and the positive tone spilt over into other markets. The=
 Turkish Eurobond market had a very strong week supported by dramatic impro=
vement in the local market: the Central Bank cut its overnight lending rate=
 from 62% to 60% after a successful T-Bill auction on Friday and local debt=
 yields declined sharply. Most of the Turkish curve was very well bid again=
st the background of revived investor activity. The Turkey 2030 benchmark r=
eached its high since the beginning of July at +935 bps spread on Thursday.=
 The Russian market also gained this week on the back of both the general E=
M sentiment and local news on the incorporation of the "financial reserve" =
(designed to accumulate US$1.8bn to help the government service its debt in=
 2003) into the draft budget for 2002. Russian assets are now trading only =
1 point below their highs since the 1998 crisis. For Central and Eastern Eu=
ropean assets this was a strong week with good demand especially for sovere=
ign bonds, although there was no significant move in prices. Despite the ov=
erall positive sentiment, Friday witnessed some weakening in all the emergi=
ng markets, caused mainly by the technical factor of profit taking once the=
 market reached two month highs. The EMBI+ Index closed only 4 bps tighter =
on the week at +882 bps after touching +861 bps during the Thursday session=
.
?=09On its 30th August meeting, the European Central Bank lowered its bench=
mark repo rate by ? point to 4.25%. European benchmark bonds reacted positi=
vely to the announcement and now are pricing in at least another ? point ra=
te cut this year. This is good news for issuers of *uro denominated bonds a=

Rick:  Recently I received an E-Mail that you and Louise Kitchen discussed my group's $544k allocation for 2002 to ENA and determined that it was incorrect and should be only $109k with the balance of $435k going to Kevin Garland's group.  Actually I did take into account the transfer of the merchant investments to Kevin's group in coming up with the $544 allocation.  For the last several years our allocation to ENA has been in excess of $1.1 million so it is less than one-half of historical levels.

The $109k is definitely low considering the following services we perform for EA:

	1)  Don Rollins and one of his Sr. Analysts spend nearly 100% of their time supporting the Thompson/Josey oil and gas group 	in due diligence, transaction structuring, document preparation, auditing, partnership liquidations, asset sales, etc. (As you 	know Don creates value several times his salary just in audit recoveries for ENA)

	2) Even after the transfer to EPI, ENA still has over $850 million in assets that are maintained in PortRAC, Dash Library, and 	certain of these asset have Watch list reporting etc. This takes at least one analyst's time.

	3) There are other due diligence areas for ENA we support such as power.  We have been pretty active recently in power plant 	purchase due diligence and actually have two of our experienced due diligence managers at a data room this week.
	
	4)  We are going to lead the effort to develop a DASH numbering "AFE type" cost control system with ENA being the first 	customer.

Please let me know your thoughts.  We had previously allocated Garland's group $544k.  If they pick up another $435k, I think that will be excessive and Kevin will be complaining.    Regards!     Rick C.

Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =
of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=
ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=
y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=
ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =
of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=
re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=
rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=
r imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=
ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=
tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=
vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=
stand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=
iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=
usly reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=
 areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=
nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=
ese include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=
r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=
me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering=
 these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=
.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =
of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =
concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=
mprovement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=
ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the=
 return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =
that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash=
 that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=
ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=
ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=
G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=
s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale=
 is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=
s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=
eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=
rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=
icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make=
 reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=
ecomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =
our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=
lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=
edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       "Under Review for Further Downgrade"

-- Fitch at BBB-             "Evolving Status"

-- S&P at BBB-              "CreditWatch Negative"

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin=
 and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=
0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =
19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=
ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =
call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =
few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=
stors under "SEC Filings."

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =
joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=
n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=
xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes=

Rick,

I am writing in regards to a training seminar I am developing on enterprise
risk management for the power/energy sector.  I am inviting speakers for the
course and would very much like for you to participate as an instructor.

Our training seminars are structured as interactive workshops.  We limit the
audience to about 20 people and bring in 2-3 instructors to facilitate the
course - generally speakers present for half-day sessions.

I'm attaching a draft of topics that could be covered.  I will follow up
with more details but please let me know if you have an initial interest in
participating.
 <<agenda.doc>> 
Thank you,
Clare Fitzgerald

Today we released additional information about our related party and off-balance sheet transactions.  We have made this information available both on our website and in a Form 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

The information provides further details about:

	-- the $1.2 billion charge to shareholders' equity announced in the third quarter and the transactions related to that charge;
	-- a restatement of prior years' financial statements to reflect this reduction in shareholders' equity, the consolidation of     three entities and prior year proposed audit adjustments and reclassifications;
	-- the Special Committee appointed by the Enron Board of Directors to review transactions between Enron and related parties; 
	-- the LJM limited partnerships, including a discussion of transactions between Enron and LJM entities; and
	-- transactions between Enron and other Enron employees.

This information addresses a number of concerns that have been raised by our shareholders and the SEC.  As our Board's new Special Committee continues its review of various matters, we will continue to cooperate fully with the SEC in its investigation, and we will continue to respond to investor requests so that they can evaluate, appreciate and appropriately value the strength of our core businesses.  

Restatement of Earnings

Based on information that we have recently obtained, Enron and its auditors determined that certain off-balance sheet entities should have been included in Enron's consolidated financial statements pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles.  As a result, Enron will restate its financial statements from 1997 to 2000 and for the first and second quarters of 2001.  These restatements have no material effect on Enron's current financial position.  Here are some details included in the filing:

Net income for each period will be impacted by the retroactive consolidation of Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) and Chewco beginning in November 1997, the consolidation of an LJM1 subsidiary for 1999 and 2000 and prior year proposed audit adjustments.  Enron's current assessment indicates that the restatement will include:

	-- a reduction of approximately $96 million in 1997
	-- a reduction of approximately $113 million in 1998
	-- a reduction of approximately $250 million in 1999 
	-- a reduction of approximately $132 million in 2000
	-- an increase of approximately $17 million for the first quarter of 2001 
	-- an increase of approximately $5 million for the second quarter of 2001
	-- a reduction of $17 million for the third quarter of 2001.  

The consolidation of JEDI and Chewco also will increase Enron's debt by approximately $711 million in 1997, $561 million in 1998, $685 million in 1999 and $628 million in 2000.

The restatement will have no material impact on Enron's reported earnings for the nine-month period ending September 2001.

You can obtain more detailed information on the items described above by accessing the Form 8-K filing at <http://www.enron.com/corp/sec/>.

We will continue to review our strategic, operational and financial position, and we will continue to keep you updated on any developments.

We are working hard to address the immediate New Power exposure.  Dave:  FYI it might actually involve Service Co. Mark, we are talking to Jimmie this morning on that idea. We will certainly review overall exposure as a part of this.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps:
	- get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health;
	- followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise.

Issues:
	- obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position?

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one?

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Regards
Delainey

Enron Benefit Plans 
Summary Annual Report    

The basic financial and insurance information on the back of this page, as well as the material below, provide a Summary Annual Report for the Enron Benefit Plans.  The annual report for each plan has been filed with the Internal Revenue Service, as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). 

NOTE:  You may receive a report for a benefit plan in which you are not a participant or under which you are not entitled.  Entitlement to benefits under any of the plans is based on the provisions of each plan.


Your Rights to Additional Information

You have the right to receive, upon request, a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan.  For insured plans, insurance information (including any sales commissions paid by insurance carriers) is shown in the annual reports.

To obtain a copy of the full annual report, or any part thereof, for any plan, write or call:

Enron Corp Shareholder Relations
1400 Smith Street
Houston, TX  77002-7311

(713) 853-6161

I believe this will give us a good sense of the validity of the information we rely on to make the assessments about risk that we are expected to make. I have mentioned this concept before - I envisioned an application (possibly using our 3d tools) that would allow an interested user to assess data flow visually, similar to the way we control our physical assets and commodity flow at ETS, for example.

The other key techniques whose results I believe we need comfort on are the "flash-to-actual" reconciliations, the process of tracking and chasing confirmations and perhaps cash collection/payment analyses. I think you may have included these in your point "4", these all point in some way to the efficacy of the mark-to-market results (which underpin most of the risk metrics we utilize), and trends in them, (or an absence of the analysis altogether), can indicate impending "controls" issues of the type we have witnessed here - so I'm a big fan.

Let me know if you need anything further from me.

Subject:	Reconciliation Across Risk Applications


Rick and Greg,

I met with Sally and Beth on August 24th to discuss the operational risk management initiative requiring a reconciliation across all major risk applications.  This reconciliation is necessary to validate the transfer of all data from 
source systems, i.e. risk books, into risk applications which calculate VAR, provide credit exposures,  feed Infinity with daily cash flows and ultimately the DPR.  

Sally and Beth, along with IT, have initiated a project to improve and monitor the accuracy and efficiency of these daily interfaces.  The scope includes a review of the processes which  impact the accuracy of  information, timing of interfaces, production performance issues, inventory of books and improved controls over changes to book attributes, and the officialization process.  They have agreed to add a requirement to provide, on a daily basis, this reconciliation across all major risk applications.

The projected  timeline to complete this project, including the reconciliation initiative, is 60 to 90 days.  We will need to reassess the decision to combine these initiatives, if the GRMO timeline slips.  
    
This daily risk applications reconciliation will provide four key metrics not currently available:

1) the ability to track data "accuracy" in terms of the percentage of information which transferred and processed correctly, vs. just unique "failures".  How complete is the data? 

2) the ability to validate the accuracy of exception reporting (are all failures included on the exception reports?)

3) the ability to validate Infinity cash flows

4) Reconciliation of values (volumes, PRMA &PRML and cash flows), not # of books processed.

Please call me if you would like to discuss. 

Wanda Curry

Steve,

Make sure that we circulate a DASH on the disposition of the QWEST note which we discussed on Friday.  I want to reinforce the concept of RAC signoff of asset sales, including the sale of financial assets such as notes and receivables.

When can we close the sale?

Thanks.

Ray

All

I would be grateful if you could prepare 2 lists of personnel for midday tomorrow which form an A list and B List and send them to me and Mark Evans. 

The A list should be the people in the your business unit who are absolutely essential, in the event of a winding up of EEL, to assist in the winding up of your commercial support unit over a short (say two week) period. The B list should include the A list but also include those people whom additionally you think would be ideal to retain to assist in this process. 

Many thanks

Sarah

Dave: If agreeable with you, we will remove "See Other RAC Comments" from the DASH template and library as an ongoing classification option.  I assume you will communicate with Underwriting and IV personnel about the  philosophy of the change and implementation.  Please let me know if my group can do anything else.  Thanks,  Rick C.

Rick,

I agree with Rick that three categories are sufficient--if the issues are substantive, they should either result in an increase in the capital price and a "Return below Capital Price" or a "Do Not Proceed" recommendation.  "Other RAC Comments" should highlight any issues succinctly, but are not a substitute for a recommendation and should be read irrespective of being highlighted on the cover page of the DASH.

Regards,

Dave

Subject:	DASH Classification - "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments"

As we discussed yesterday, in our review of our DASH recommendation vs. actual performance we found 36 DASHes that have been approved since late 1999 that carry the recommendation "Proceed - See Other RAC Comments".  Typically the RAC Comments describe substantial issues that must be resolved if the transaction is to be successful.

Given RAC's increased visability and accountability for portfolio performance, perhaps a more forceful description than "See Other RAC Comments" would be desirable which could be  something like: 

		"Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required" 

Therefore, the four DASH categories would be as follows:

	___  Proceed with Transaction

	____ Issues - Sr. Management Approval Required

	____ Returns Below Capital Price

	____ Do Not Proceed

The "See other RAC Comments" could be used as a footnote with an asterisk placed on any of the above categories where we wanted to call the reader's attention to our comment section.  We would, however, eliminate "See other RAC Comments"  as an official DASH classification category.  

Please let me know what you think.  We can instantly make this change or any variation you would like in both the DASH Template and Library.     
							Regards!

  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number3.gif>Drag and Drop Memos
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
Memo Pad automatically numbers your memos, but you can also manually change the order in which the memos appear by dragging and dropping them. Simply hold down the stylus on the memo, and drag it to where you want it to go!

  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number2.gif>Beaming Your Business Card
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
When you beam your business card, any attached note will be beamed along with it. Have a resume or a favorite quotation (up to 4,096 characters) that you'd like to share with others? Simply attach it as a note to your business card.

  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/number1.gif>Floating Events
	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>		
Floating events in Date Book Plus let you set appointments that "float" with you through the calendar, appearing each day until you've finally completed the task or event. Use floating events anytime you have a task or appointment that isn't necessarily fixed to a certain date. Like picking up dry cleaning-it may be ready on Monday, but who knows when you'll actually have time to pick it up? In Day View, just tap New, then tap Floating Event from the popup menu, and enter the name of the event. Your new floating event will appear as a circle on your Day View until you delete it.

Biking Cross-Country with My Visor Handheld
I'm a partner for a graphic design firm. Taking three months off to bicycle from Washington, DC, to Florence, Oregon, would put a strain on the company. But my partner and our staff had given me their "you go, girl" blessing. They even built a special section of our corporate web site to highlight the trip:
(http://www.gravesfowler.com/noteworthy/beyond.html <http://r.4at1.com/c/e/r/r.jsp?rid=141.2182.10968.42943.4688.233.34125625>). The plan was to post our journal as we moved across the country. It was a beautiful design; now the pressure was on for me to do the writing and get it back to them.

That's where my Visor came in. With a collapsible keyboard and modem module, we had a lightweight package of technology that would fit into my bag and keep us connected. We also carried a backup module to insure we wouldn't lose data when batteries ran low and we were miles from a store. I learned to set up my traveling office on picnic tables, in our tent, on diner tables surrounded by pancakes and eggs, in country churches and steamy laundromats. We stayed in a motel once a week and hooked up the modem to send the week's entries back home.

	
We also collected email messages from folks who were following our progress. As the weeks and miles added up, we realized through this connection how many people were rooting for us and following our unfolding story.	   <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0082/final/images/011502biking.jpg>	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0001/final/images/spacer.gif>	
We feel lucky to have lived out a long time dream. Now in the middle of winter, I sometimes open my Visor, click back to a random summer day and savor the memories.

Doug,
I will bring this issue up with EGAS management - - will revert with their feedback on this internal accounting transfer (i.e., no new cash to Enron) as well as the trasnfer of associated interest gonig forward, etc.  We need to consider the potential effect to Enron of this internal transfer from the perspective of legal strategies as well as current restructuring efforts with the lenders.  

On another matter: have not heard from you regarding the Venezuela trading assistance (from Vengas).  

Thanks, Mariella

With SECLP being shutdown for almost two months and no positive news in sight I think we need to address the internal transfer of $28 million to settle the outstanding fuel bill. There is no longer a reason for this to remain on EFI's receivables and we need to settle the account.

As per our discussion last week, Sally will get with you and review the closing of the books that occurs each night.  This is in reference to the issue of which of the approximately 1200 books get closed easily and which ones require some miracles.  The goal is to better understand the issues at the commodity and/or business unit level.

Thanks.

     ... how about an LBO?

Certain high net worth executives sponsor the deal in conjunction with a
major financial investor such as JPM/Chase or Citibank.  Force the share
trust participants to go along and cut in all management and employees.  It
gets the company out of the spotlight and might have some real attraction
for deal starved investors... esp at this price level.  It could remotivate
everyone and provide a way to recover some of the lost value that had
accrued to the employees over the years.  Obviously, some stakeholders
would do better that others but that's the way it goes sometimes.

Just a thought.

Hang in there.

Jim

AMERICAN EXPRESS MEMBERSHIP REWARDS ANNOUNCEMENT

All Membership Rewards accounts were cancelled when American Express cancelled the Enron/American Express Corporate Cards.  To redeem Membership Rewards Points earned, the Corporate Card Account must be paid to a zero balance.  Upon paying the account  to a zero balance you have two options to redeem the points:

1)  Establish a Personal Card account with American Express and have the points that were accrued on the Corporate Card transferred to the Personal Card.  To apply for a Personal Card over the phone you can call 1-800-The-Card (843-2273).  Cardmembers must transfer Membership Rewards points to the new card by March 1, 2002.

2) If you do not have a Personal Card and do not want to establish a Personal Card, you should call the American Express Membership Rewards Redemption Line at 1-800-297-3276 and ask to speak with the Executive Consumer Relations Desk.  You should identify yourself as an Enron employee and request that your Membership Rewards be reinstated.  Reinstated points must be redeemed before March 1, 2002.  

For information on all travel services, please contact Tracy Ramsey at (713) 853-6457.

Rick, 
I have been asked by Michael to substantiate allocations from RAC - not necessarily to reduce them.  
As proposed, they are:
			Credit 	$369k (5%)
			Market 	$630k (14%)
			Und	$499k (10%)
			Port	$108k (5%)

Given, that we have an Underwriting function here and do not have a large % of deals go to Houston for approval, I think this allocation seems high (recommend $250K)
some of the excess can be attributed to the work of Jack/Jim/Brad on e&p and coal deals - these belong either in Global Markets, Global Assets or Principal investments
For 2002, we will have  no assets  therefore  Portfolio number is also high (recommend  approx. 50k) - balance should go to principal investments and Global Assets.
The market risk side, this office does take a fair amount of market risk on a relative basis and we have a relatively small group here on the ground as well as no Quantitative team or RisktRAC development/maintenance, this seems reasonable  - perhaps a little high (Recommend 12% or $550K)
Given the amount of time we engage Bill on policy and deal analysis, the amount of work required on the Credit Aggregation System and process and, last , but not least, our portion of your fully loaded cost contained in Bill's budget which provides management, deal analysis, Underwriting support, this seems low - (recommend 7.5% or $555k)
Please let me know what you think.
Ted

This includes the oversight responsibilities of Rick Buy for all Risks across Enron Europe.  It also includes my time dedciated to managing corporate wide credit risks inclusive of those in Enron Europe.  I am also responsible to keep consistent credit practices across Enron Corp. and report aggregate credit updates to senior management and the Board.  Debbie Brackett also supports Enron Europe in leading the aggregation of global positions and exposures.  We also have analysts working on credit reviews and exposure analyses for common counterparties.

If anything this allocation should probably be higher.

I am producing the budget 2002 for RAC in Enron Europe and am looking for explanations behind the charge we have received for CRM from Houston of $369k for 2002.  Are you able to provide me with a break down of this allocation of cost, which I will include in my report to Ted Murphy?  

Should you have any questions or if I should contact somebody else with this query please don't hesitate to contact me.

Consider taking your knowledge and applying it to a new situation, something
concrete.  This will help you move forward and looking up, rather than
continuing to look back down on something that blew up.

CONFIDENTIAL NOTE TO RICK & DAVE:  Do either of you have a clear understand=
ing of Corporate Development's mission in regard to the development of this=
 database to assist in the divestiture of certain of the merchant investmen=
ts?  A few weeks ago we met with Sherron to show her PortRAC which she want=
ed to use along with some livelink files to assist them in divestiture acti=
vity.  Her final vision as portrayed by the attached presentation has turne=
d into a large database which will take lots of resources to develop and ma=
intain which she has indicated by her memo should be supported by my group.=
  Also, it seems redundant with RAC's existing data plus a lot information =
that is maintained by the business units such as Kevin Garland's group.  I =
am comfortable that we can respond to any data request as well as build a d=
ata room if necessary for a big sale/syndication with our our existing data=
 and our newest tools (PortRAC, COMET, RAC Website,  DASH Library, etc.) wi=
thout creating another database.  Since Sherron has left the group, do you =
think that this new database is her idea alone or is it also embraced by Do=
nahue? =20

Concerns aside, if you think that this new database is necessary, we are ce=
rtainly capable of supporting it.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Sherron,

It's been a while since we had our last meeting. I would like to follow-up =
with you regarding the Asset Library. I would like to find out if you are s=
till interested in pursuing this project. We left off on issues surrounding=
 RAC and integrating your operations with them. I have not been aware of an=
y decisions regarding this, as well as direction that you wish to go. I loo=
k forward to hearing from you. Thanks.


Cornelio

Attached is the legal risk memo for the proposed sale by certain Enron entities of their interest in UtiliQuest LLC.  This transaction has been given a legal risk ranking of 2.0 (on a scale of 1.0 to 5.0, with 1.0 indicating minimal legal risk), primarily due to potential post-closing indemnification obligations.  
 
The legal risks discussed in this memo were also set forth in the DASH; however, please note the following correction to the DASH:  while the Enron entities' pro rata share of the maximum potential liability under the seller indemnity is $20.7 million, Enron and the other sellers have joint and several liability for indemnification obligations which are capped at $30 million, and Enron will be liable for the entire $30 million if the non-Enron sellers cannot satisfy their pro rata share of the liability under the seller indemnity (note that Enron is not guaranteeing or backstopping the other sellers' share of this liability in any way; however, the purchaser may choose to hold Enron liable for the entire liability, and leave Enron to pursue the other sellers for their share).   
 
Please contact me if you have any questions.

>From Kevin Hannon, Jim Hughes and John Lavorato

Our efforts to move our South American merchant business model to look like our North American and European models has been evolving quickly.  In the volatile Brazilian power market, Enron is poised to start-up the first merchant plant in the near future.  We are working on several structured transactions and are at the forefront in working with Brazilian regulators to create a viable deregulated power market.

To continue our positive momentum in South America, we have decided to change the leadership of the merchant business.  We have asked Orlando Gonzalez to become President and CEO.  In addition we have asked Brett Wiggs to join Orlando in the office of the chairman as Chief Commercial Officer.

Joe Kishkill has been involved in the South American business for many years and will be exploring other opportunities within Enron.  We would like to thank Joe for his contributions.  

Please join us in congratulating Orlando and Brett on their new duties.

No change in cash at this time.  Agreement will provide for netting and set-off only upon an event of default in an underlying agreement.  Cash in/out will depend upon positions at that time.

As requested the enclosed spreadsheet analyses the trading v origination for Enron Europe for 2000 and 2001, quarter by quarter by commodity.

The numbers up until 30/9/01 agree to those submitted by financial control in SAP and from 30/11 to 2/11 the numbers are per the DPR. The origination analysis is for trades greater than $5m except in the structures books where a threshold of $10m has been taken.

Those items under the 'significant non-recurring items' line can also be thought of as origination and have been separated on the basis that they are typically monetisations or related to the sale of Sutton Bridge.

The bulk financial books are theta, rho and drift as well the cost of capital book and  FX differences on the revaluation of the non $ currency P&L.

Any questions please let me know.

James

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

On Monday August 6, about 75 new full-time Associates will be starting their careers at Enron.  Attached is a schedule of Orientation Topics, as well as an invitation to welcome these Associates at a Happy Hour Monday evening.  It would be great if you could stop by, even for just a few minutes, to welcome them to the company.  For your convenience, the Happy Hour is at Farrago, which is less than 6 blocks from the Enron Building.   

Members of the Program regularly tell us that senior level interaction is an area that we can improve on, so your participation in events like this very important.  An RSVP is not required, but if you plan to attend, please let us know so we can prepare a name tag for you.  Feel free to extend this invitation to other senior members of your team.

As always, we appreciate your continued support of The Program.

Regards,
Billy

Below are the proposed discounts we discussed with Ken Lay this afternoon:

USD millions:       
                          Cash from 85       P+L with 85 cent 
             Discount   cent sale of claim    sale of claim

Enron      $ 85.0 (17%)       $361.8             +$129.1      
PG&E       $237.0 (46%)       $232.6             -$  0.1 
Midpoint   $161.0 (32%)       $297.2             +$ 64.5



If the midpoint (value between PG&E and Enron settlement offers) is acceptable from a liquidity and P+L standpoint, propose countering at a discount of $123 million (move half way to midpoint) to provoke a counter offer.   Intent is to settle at midpoint discount of $161 million.  The Excel file is attached.

	PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE FROM SALLY BECK CONCERNING THE CANCELLATION OF FUTURE EES/EWS PROCESS MEETINGS.

 -----Original Message-----

Subject:	Suggested text for message on EES meeting

The weekly EES/EWS meeting with Rick Causey, Rick Buy and Dan Leff on Thursdays from 3:00 - 4:00 pm in EB3321 is being revamped to insure that the agenda and format for the meeting are organized to maximize the benefit from these recurring meetings.  In reviewing the availability of key players over the next several weeks and to allow time to create meaningful tracking documents for critical milestones, the Thursday meetings will be cancelled from now through the first week in September.  The meeting will resume beginning Thursday, September 13 from 3:00 to 4:00 and will be held every other week from that point forward.   You will be notified prior to the resumption of these meetings in September if you need to put this on your calendar as a recurring meeting.  The list of attendees is being reviewed, with the possibility of reducing the number of attendees in an effort to utilize people's time wisely and to create an atmosphere for frank dialogue regarding progress.

FYI - failed to calculate yet today due to "server resource constraints" -  based on prices/position changes my guess is it should not have moved much but yet to confirm.

Rather than hold a meeting to discuss the Finance Comm. meeting scheduled for Monday, Feb. 11, I have asked Laura Valencia to schedule a conference call with Pug Winokur and the three of us to discuss the agenda and the presentation materials.  Please watch for this meeting on your calendar, or let me know if you have already been in contact with Pug such that no meeting is necessary.  

Also, pls. note that the Board and Committee meetings will be held in NYC.  If you do not have other reasons to travel to NYC, I suggest you connect via teleconference.  

Thanks.  Paula

Please find attached the below referenced budget for NETCO for Credit.  Included currently are primarily the basic employee costs based on average salaries and wages and average run rates (based on Sept 2001 YTD costs) for other types of expenses for your department.  It is very important that any additional costs specific to your department which you feel are not represented in this budget be added at this time.  Please review this budget and confirm to me your agreement or any changes or additions to it by 3:00 pm today.

Please feel free to contact me at X30669 with any questions you have regarding this information.

just a note to the team....the restructuring concept has not yet been presented to Duferco, but will be shortly, and as of  our meeting this morning, Gregg Hermans is tasked with being the single point person from Enron in dealing with Duferco on these issues.

Subject:	EIM steel transactions pipeline update

Attached is the updated status of the steel trades/transactions that have potential LOC/cashflow impact in the next few months.  According to Kent, who had a direct conversation with Bowen late yesterday, all new steel trades/structured transactions not yet agreed to will require Bowen approval prior to being reviewed by RAC.  

In summary, the commitment status for the Kibar and EDZK trades is yet to be determined, upon reviewing the taped conversation between the traders and the counterparties.  Duferco payments for the final 100,000 ton slab purchase and the $40,000 option are up for restructuring next week with the company.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.  Thanks.

Rick: =20

Thanks for the information on the task at hand regarding operational risk. =
 We will certainly name an appropriate person from Operations to be involve=
d in this project, and will work with you to help in achieving your objecti=
ves.  There doesn't appear to be anyone from ETS on your distribution list.=
  Operational risk is broad and would seem to be present in all of Enron's =
businesses.  Is the initial focus simply on the "wholesale businesses", or =
is there an intent to make this enterprise-wide? =20

I suspect that it would be helpful for all of us on the distribution list t=
o have a context for the way in which you see this RAC initiative complemen=
ting, replacing, overlapping, or perhaps duplicating the work of EAS, AA's =
internal audit engagement, the critical self assessment process being pilot=
ed in London this year by the operations team in conjuction with the AA aud=
its, Doorstep reviews, current operational risk reporting done by the vario=
us operations teams, and our major initiatives for EES tracked every other =
Thursday with you and Rick Causey.   Before we each choose our appropriate =
representatives from our respective areas, it might be constructive to cove=
r this in a kick-off meeting with the addressees on your memo. =20

I might also suggest that we work to clearly define roles and responsibilit=
ies at the beginning of this project.  The creation of a framework for quan=
tifying enterprise-wide operational risk is perhaps different from the impl=
ementation of daily processes or systems that are used at the business unit=
 levels.  As on other policies devised by RAC, it would seem that implement=
ation of anything new to meet reporting requirements against the to-be-deve=
loped operational risk policy should rest with the appropriate business uni=
t/functional area outside RAC.  The cross-functional team that will be form=
ed is probably best used to give input to RAC in creating the policy, but m=
ay not necessarily be the right body for implementation of specific initiat=
ives. =20

Finally, the second bullet point in Wanda's list below is already being add=
ressed through the project that you and I agreed upon in August to insure t=
hat information from all source systems to RisktRAC is complete, accurate a=
nd efficiently handled. As you and I discussed, this is a global effort spa=
nning all commodities/all locations/all source systems.   We have formed a =
steering committee with appropriate project managers and have worked closel=
y with Debbie Brackett in defining the scope, approach, key milestones, res=
ource requirements and projected timeline (Project Greenlight).  A team of =
stakeholders from Operations, IT and Debbie Brackett will meet tomorrow in =
order to review the project plan with David Port and Bill Bradford for fina=
l input.  My assistant is working with yours to set up a meeting then for D=
ebbie and me to review the work done to date and to review the proposed pla=
n and timeline.   Assuming that you are comfortable with Project Greenlight=
 when we review the details with you,  I think that it would be appropriate=
 to take this item off of the Wanda's list.  We can certainly update the cr=
oss-functional team on efforts underway, but there is no need for a new tea=
m to focus on this bullet point. =20

As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addres=
ses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop system=
s and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk. =
 To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the=
 "Operational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeti=
ng this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assuran=
ce Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderso=
n. =20

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk i=
s to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) impr=
ove the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelin=
es for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be=
 our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate expos=
ure to operational risk.  =20

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operation=
al risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of=
 the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial go=
al, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/o=
r report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's object=
ive, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistica=
tion of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitati=
ve assessments and quantitative measurements. =20

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional tea=
m has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
=09
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  =
This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards t=
o identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management w=
ith a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmati=
on that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, =
CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the abil=
ity to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spread=
sheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuatio=
n models and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor interc=
ompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and repo=
rt variances=20
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operationa=
l risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team. =20

Thanks,

Rick Buy

1.	Please confirm that the date that Accro commenced commercial operation was 7/6/2001.
2.	At the time Accro payouts were approved for payment relative to financial close, the projected NPV of cash flows related to Enron's interest was $18.331 million.  An updated NPV calculation, reviewed and signed off on by RAC is required, to determine what, if any, additional payments might be presented to the Compensation Committee for approval.  Norm Spalding has supplied December financials to Compensation and can supply them to the appropriate RAC individual.  By copy of this email to Rick Buy, I am asking who in RAC is available to review the financials.  Have you spoken to anyone in RAC about this project?  

I think the process will entail:
1.	Sign off by RAC.
2.	Sign off by Jim Hughes and Stan Horton.
3.	Sign off by Compensation Committee.
4.	Sign off by Creditor Committee and possibly E&Y even though these are bonuses associated with non-debtor entity.

Thanks for your help.

A few more details ................   Again, most of the EGA companies' ownership trail includes all Enron ownership through a number of Enron entities.  Through further research, we found a few more that don't totally fit that mold:
 
Elektro - Electricidad e Servicos S.A. in Brazil  .... 38% of this company if publicly held with the remainder held by Enron entities.
EPE - Empresa Productora de Energia Ltda in Brazil has outside owners including Shell and LJM Brazilco and Interjuris S/C Ltda. a.k.a. Shell Cuiaba Holdings owns two shares and has a 1% direct ownership interest and one Board vote.
Energia Ltd, another Brazil operation, is owned by ENBRAS which in turn in owned by Enron Corp.   (Shares of the company are pledged to Westdeusche Landesbank Gironzentrale as of 22 Feb. 01.
 
Again, this may be more information than you ever wanted or needed but thought you might like to know.

Steve:
 
As stated earlier, many of the company names on the list that was provided either do not exactly match what we have in corporate records or there is such a long list with very similar names that we have just made assumptions in most cases regarding ownership.
 
We can assure you that, for the most part, you have placed the companies in the correct business bucket (i.e., Corp., ENA, EES, etc.).  There are a few, however, that may be incorrectly categorized, as follows:
 
EA:             ECT Non U.S. Payroll Company (there is no such entity, but I would assume these folks are paid by ENA)
                   Enron Capital & Trade Resources in London, UK  (may actually be Enron Europe company called Enron Capital & Trade Resources Limited)
 
EBS:           Broadband Solutions Pvt. Ltd. (actually comes up to Corp. through a long complicated chain of companies associated with Atlantic Commercial Finance)
 
EEOS:        Enron Engineering & Construction and the former NEPCO are both organized under EESO whose ownership remains Enron Corp.
                   The NEPCO in the UK could actually be NEPCO Europe Ltd. whose ownership is tied to Enron Europe.  
 
EES:           Enron Direct LTD Partnership is actually an Enron North America entity
                    The others are either EES or bundled under EES even though they are thought of as Enron Facilities Services/Limbach companies
 
EGA:         Here's where the going gets tough because the vast majority of these Enron Global Assets entities have very complicated organization structures with 
                 complicated, multi-layers structures that eventually lead back to Enron Corp. ownership.  As you know all of the old subsets (i.e. APACHI, CALME, etc.) have
                 gone away and everything international is now EGA.    To the best of our knowledge, all of these entities and their employees are Enron managed.
                 Following are the exceptions and/or unusual organizational structure that should be noted:
                    Electricidad Enron de Guatemala S.A. actually reports up through ENA
                    San Juan Gas Company, Inc. in Puerto Rico is a direct sub of Enron Corp. (100% owned)
                    Enron American del Sur, S.A.  is an Enron Corp./Enron Transportation Services entity
                    No entity called Enron Singapore .... more than likely Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Singapore which is Enron North America company.
 
EIM:         No Stadacona Paper Company but it  is probably Compagnie Papier Stadaconda which is owned in a complicated structure through a Netherlands EIM 
                Holdings Company and then through Sundance Industrial Partners including Enron Industrial Markets GP Corp. as the general partner and a list of Limited
                Partners including ENA, Enron Corp. and a non-Enron entity (Salomon Brothers Holding Company, Inc.)
 
ENW:        Enron Net Works, LLC is a wholly owned Enron Corp. company
 
EWC:        The Enron Wind Group is all part of Enron Renewable Energy Corp. which is owned by Smith Street Land Co., an Enron Corp. company, but many of the 
                 names listed here do not correspond to any official names on our list.   For instance there is no Enron Wind Greece but it may be Enron Wind Hellas, S.A.; 
                 no Enron Wind UK, no Enron Wind India .... but regardless, they are all part of the EWC/EREC family.
 
GLOBAL    These entities all are a part of Enron Global Exploration & Production, Inc., which is owned by Enron Corp., but one has indirect outside ownership.
 EP:           Enron Oil & Gas India Ltd., for instance, is owned by Enron Asst Holdings, which is owned by Enron Finance Partners, which is part of a complex ownership
                 structure that includes one non-Enron entity (Zephyrus Investments, LLC) with a small interest.      
                    
Again, I hope this information is helpful.  For the most part the list appears to be in order except for the ones mentioned and for the fact that so many of the names are incomplete and hard to definitively track.  Let my group know if we can be of additional assistance.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

MEMO TO:		ISDA North American Risk Management Contacts

FROM:			Karel Engelen
 
DATE:			January 2, 2002

RE:			Risk Management Luncheon


ISDA is pleased to announce that Edward I. Altman, Max L. Heine Professor of
Finance at the Stern School of Business, New York University, will speak at
our next Risk Management luncheon.  

In his presentation Professor Altman will present the results of a recent
study he conducted on the correlation between the Probability of Default and
Recovery Rates and the effects of this correlation on expected losses and
risk measures. He will discuss in more detail the correlation between
Recovery Rates and Probability of Default in the Merton model. The
multivariate econometric estimation model for Recovery Rates on Corporate
bond Defaults is extremely accurate in predicting 2001 Recovery Rates. The
research work has been done together with two Italian Colleagues: Andrea
Sironi and Andrea Resti.

Since 1990, Professor Altman has directed the research effort in Fixed
Income and Credit Markets at the NYU Salomon Center. He is currently the
Vice-Director of the Center. Prior to serving in his present position,
Professor Altman chaired the Stern School's MBA Program for 12 years. He has
been a visiting Professor at the Hautes Etudes Commerciales and Universite
de Paris-Dauphine in France, at the Pontificia Catolica Universidade in Rio
de Janeiro, at the Australian Graduate School of Management in Sydney and at
the Luigi Bocconi University in Milan.

Dr. Altman has an international reputation as an expert in corporate
bankruptcy, high yield bonds, distressed debt and credit risk analysis. He
was named Laureate 1984 by the Hautes Etudes Commerciales Foundation in
Paris for his accumulated works on corporate distress prediction models and
procedures for firm financial rehabilitation and awarded the Graham & Dodd
Scroll for 1985 by the Financial Analysts Federation for his work on Default
Rates on High Yield Corporate Debt. He was named "Profesor Honorario" by the
University of Buenos Aires in 1996. He is currently an advisor to the
Centrale dei Bilanci in Italy and to several foreign central banks.
Professor Altman is also the Chairman of the Academic Council of the
Turnaround Management Association. Dr. Altman was named to the Max L. Heine
endowed professorship at Stern in 1988. He was inducted into the Fixed
Income Analysts Society Hall of Fame in 2001 and elected President of the
Financial Management Association (2002). He received his MBA and Ph.D. in
Finance from the University of California, Los Angeles.

The luncheon will be held on Friday January 11, 2002 at 12:00 p.m. at the
Liffe USA Ltd. premises, 55 Broadway, Suite 2602, One Exchange Plaza, New
York.

If you would like to attend this luncheon, please notify Scott Marra at the
ISDA New York office (smarra@isda.org) by January 7, 2002. Because of
security requirements only people that reserved will be admitted to the
building.

We look forward to seeing you there.

 I do not believe the Alaghband issue was researched for the first deal; however, the two deals are vastly different from each other.  The first deal (with Webco JV) was a 1 year inventory management deal in which we had title to the product the entire time.  That risk profile contrasts sharply with a 15 year option with a $40MM unsecured loan. Per our London team, the deal does not break even until year 7, and much of the value is in the tail. Clearly, a higher level of due diligence should be required.

Additionally, Paul Maley does not have pro-forma data on the merged Balli-Klockner entity - just a company prepared presentation. Balli is purely a trading company, and it is our understanding that Klockner is largely the same; the new entity is projected to be extremely leveraged. 

Please let me know if you have additional questions.

Thanks,
Tanya

Rick:

Please find attached an EIM report on our prospective counterparty(ies) on the Balli-Klockner $40m steel prepay.  We received this report from EIM after informing them that we would require a background check by Lynn's team before proceeding.  

Apparently, Enron closed a deal in the US earlier this year with WeBco which is a joint venture between Balli Group and Wierton Steel.  The commercial team is arguing that RAC and others must have investigated the allegations below at the time, but obviously felt comfortable enough to let the deal proceed.  

I believe that Ted is planning to give you a call on this to discuss.  

Regards.

Olivier

PS:  I am forwarding you another email we received from EIM on the same subject.

Dear Greg,

Attached is an update to my initial report on Balli Group and the Alaghband family.  

I have obtained a copy of the 1994 House of Representatives report referenced in the March 1999 Der Spiegel article I noted in my initial report.  This House report contains derogatory allegations about the Alaghband family and their business practices -- the relevant section is included in the attached update.  Sources note that the author of the report was known for "sensational" writing on topics difficult to verify.

I have also included excerpts of an interview with another source -- an Iranian businessman based in London who is a close personal and professional contact of the Alaghband family.  His comments are positive, barring Vahid Alaghband's alleged tendency to hold bills, and provide some additional information on the family and their  associations.  

I believe this wraps up all outstanding inquiries on this matter.  Please let me know if you have questions or areas for additional inquiry.

Best regards,

Kimberly

I do not have an issue with shifting $0.5 MM of VaR from Power to Gas. 

However, I do not want to hear of another bad decision or a control problem at PGE. Thus, it is a good practice for them to run this change by the Chief Risk Officer.

I am fine with these changes.   It is generally preferred to get Rick's consent to such changes to avoid difficulties going forward.    I don't think there will be any problem, but it's just good practice to keep the Chief Risk Officer in the loop.     I will be more than happy to forward for you, or you may actually just forward this.

Rod,

Listed below is one of the items that I have been trying to get a hold of you
on.  The others can wait until you have a few minutes.


We have spent some time reviewing the allocation of our VaR and net open
position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to
better match the limits and their objectives to our trading activity and
portfolio.

1.  VaR:  Given that we are a naturally short utility and do not hedge our
long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons we
would like to  reallocate $500k of our regulated electric VaR to our regulated
natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR
to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of our natural
short position in the back-end of our reporting period. After reducing our
electric VaR we will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated
electric portfolio.

2. NOP:  After changing our regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary
to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently we have been using a
10 Bcf limit for our NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR we recalculated
 the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.

I have reviewed these changes with Vlady and he has concurred with my proposed
changes.  In our conversation he recommended that in addition to reviewing
these changes with you that I also run them by Rick Buy.  It was my intent to
review these changes with you but I was surprised by having to review these
changes with Rick.  It was my understanding that once an allocation of VaR was
made to a business unit that it is within the business units preview to
reallocate that VaR as needed to met business unit objectives.  If the
business process has changed I will be glad to contact Rick and review these
changes with him.  Its your call so please let me know your preference.


Thanks.

Subject:	Resume of a person I worked with at American General

I do not know if you are looking for anyone right now in your group, but attached is the resume of a woman I used to work with at American General Corporation ("AGC").  She was an excellent business person.  I worked with her on private placement transactions.  One of the responsibilities of a private placement analyst at AGC was credit analysis.  If I can answer any questions about her let me know.  The only reason she is currently looking is because of the possible job losses following the acquisition of AGC by AIG.

David Port and I are working with Glisan and Despain on this.  Naveen is developing models to stress potential margin requirements.  Debbie's team is insuring contractual committments are briefed in database and coordinating with David Hardy in London.  Credit team is negotiating incremental collateral provisions on a daily basis with aim to maximize Enron credit lines while managing credit exposures with counterparties.

Working on the New Power deal really gets one thinking about the liquidity provisions in contracts (collateral posting provisions).   Given the emphasis on the swings in net cash/credit posted at a Enron Corp level, perhaps we should think of metric to measure the posting risk.   Contracts have different thresholds (or none at all) and the effect on our credit capacity is not always symetrical.

I was just thinking of the mountain of things going on, outside of normal stuff, and I decided to make a list. Here it is:

Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy 
Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte 
Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte 
Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte 
Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry 
EES???-All 
Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford 
Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson 
Private Equity Trading-Gorte 
Credit Consistency study- Buy 

I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 

If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.


Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.  Investors and security holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospectus (when it is available) and other documents containing information about Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

			     GLOBAL RISK MANAGEMENT OPERATIONS
						    PRESENTS

			   THE NEW EXECUTIVE REPORTS VIEWER

					         http://erv.corp.enron.com

The Global Risk Management Operations group has redesigned the Executive Reports Viewer website to be more efficient and robust enough to accomodate the growing number of reports and users utilizing the viewer.  

The Viewer's new functionality includes:

-An easier to view home page with all reports grouped by Business Unit
-Enhanced security features allowing publisher's to assign security to sections of a report
-Capability of directly emailing the publisher of a report with any questions
-Improved ability to access reports using links and a calendar function
-Comprehensive list of publishers for all reports
-Email notification to viewers when reports are published
-Business links connecting you to industry websites for additional market information
-Report history up to one year, opposed to the former 30 day limit


The old website will close down on July 23rd.  Reports will be published to both sites until then.

Please contact Chris Abel, x33102, Anita Luong, x36753 or Shona Wilson, x39123, with any questions.

If you would like a personal walk thru, please contact Pamela Sonnier, at x37531.

Sounds like a great idea to get together and discuss.  We definitely need to own this process.  I am not sure Marshall or the orignation team has much understanding of the true value of this from of credit risk syndication.  We have reviewed some of these policies in the past and enforcing claims is not as clean as cash or l/c's.  Legal opinion was not very favorable in the past either.  I am not sure how much of this we should do and what precedent it sets for the rest of our portfolio.  If we do any it should be centralized on predictable credit exposures (A/R or annuities) and not volatile MTM exposures.  
 
That being said, we have big targets in ugly credit markets which will require we take on some more risk.  An insurance policy is better than nothing but lets make sure McMahon understands that comparables to credit policies for the gas and power market is not relevant when his business is clearly different.

Rick/Bill 
The steel team (Bruce Garner et al) here is considering a credit insurance product to support their sales into uk market.  Paul Maley, who is from the insurance world, has been part of the discussions and believes that there is a viable product for a portion of the business.  Not a fix for long-dated mark-to-market exposure out of Russia, but probably could release some credit capacity for sales to weak industry names on a delivered/unpaid basis into first world legal environments.  A bit pricey but may be less expensive on a per $ basis if lots of transactions.  He has been in touch with David Marshall in Global Risk Managment (Houston Insurance guy).  I suggested that Paul and I get together with you guys to go through in some detail.   This is encouraging that people are working on such things, but it would be great if we set the pace and organized the process.  Speak to you tomorrow or Thurs.

Attached is the updated status of the steel trades/transactions that have potential LOC/cashflow impact in the next few months.  According to Kent, who had a direct conversation with Bowen late yesterday, all new steel trades/structured transactions not yet agreed to will require Bowen approval prior to being reviewed by RAC.  

In summary, the commitment status for the Kibar and EDZK trades is yet to be determined, upon reviewing the taped conversation between the traders and the counterparties.  Duferco payments for the final 100,000 ton slab purchase and the $40,000 option are up for restructuring next week with the company.

Please let me know if you have any questions/concerns.  Thanks.

Ray- Steel group wants to purchase $15.3 million per month of steel for 3 years. It appears this deal is creating inventory (no offsetting short). Do you have any thoughts on this as acting head of EIM? Doesn't sound like the best use of our liquidity at this point. Rick (We have a million issues to address like this around the company).

Rick,
There are very few single issues that require urgent consultation with you, however there are lots of little things that you may want to be aware of:
	We had an FSA 'Traded Risk' 2-day audit the past two days.  The operations/risk group bore the brunt of the work but Michael Pitt and I spent some time with them as well and we did do some level of preparation.  Jonathon Marsh, our compliance guy, seeemed very pleased with the result.  You never get away clean, but I think that they were impressed with the effort as well as the Enron risk culture.  by the way, my opinion of both Jonathan Marsh and Paul Freeman, the new technology guy is quite high - they are both good guys who want to make positive changes and not afraid to say whats on their mind.
	2 risk policy issues came up - one regarding credit trading and the other regarding the freight book wanting to lay off credit risk with the credit book.
these we are slated to discuss with you tomorrow.
	There are 2 new bad credits in Metals - 1 related to McCook where two of the 3 companies in the group declared ch 11 - we are owed est. $7.5MM
		the other co. is the one that has granted us a free gigantic option on tolling ally for power - the commercial team is attempting to work out a situation
		where we transfer the unsecured claims to the ch 11 entities to a first security package on the smelter in co 3.
		The other bad deal is a lead company out ogf the NY office where they owe us $450K on financials and we owe them $1MM on physicals - we are working on netting the positions

There are a number of deals being worked on surrounding TPL ppa's in which the power positions would be taken on by Enron and we would get cash to either extinguish or re-mark the price (the purchases are way out of the money).  There are 3 in the negotiation process - each big - not at the decision or DASH stage.

we had a DASH signed off while I was away on ETOL for a gas turbine in which we get tolling in exchange for a capacity payment.

I assume you are up to speed on the tragedy at TPL yesterday.

Norway is looking at 2 large power prepays with municipal generators - low probability

we will be circulating a DASH on $2MM more into Thrace - turkish e&p and pipeline play - total exp =$7.25MM
	team worked extensively with Jim ledlow and Brad on the analysis.  deal looks fine on the surface - 46% iirr vs 35% capital price.  only real issue is 'do we want to sink more $ into Turkey in order to improve the chances of a good sale or do we just put progress on hold'  good news is that $1.5mm is coming from cash flow from the project.

We have in the works one of the few EES NA-type deals with Guiness at a single facility.  $9mm in capital.

in the markets, we do not seem to be doing particularly well of late - Norway is down, uk gas has gotten caught in a short squeeze, uk power has lost a little, metals is metals
....
things are moving on the personell front as well:
Rudi starts monday
Mike Mumford (internal transfer from Enron Credit) start 9/3
Tracy comes in mid September
Blair van Zant -Director credit starts on 9/30
Shane Miller -m specialist mrm started yestdy
Erik beekman - specialist mrm starts early sep
Joachim von Geilieu - director credit is weighing an offer
John Collenette - sr director - credit has resigned his job/accepted our offer with 11/5 outside start date
Michel Gantois - director -credit/underwriting has accetped and will start in houston soon and relocate to london no later than 12/01
we have several quite interesting junior candidates for credit which we will decide on within a week
there are 2 strong candidates for a sr dir role 
and we have seen several other interesting candidates
and we have a few other internal folks who are interested
I have agreed to let Paul Freeman have Michael Pitt to continue his good work on project Salem - it will be good to have a friendly in their territory. it also frees up a budget spot.

That's all for now.
hope to talk to you today - otherwise I will be in Houston - touching down at 5:00 pm tommorrow. plan to be in office sunday to consider the potential questions from the board.

At the last RAC Departmental meeting concern was expressed that the vacant positions within RAC were not being filled as quickly as hoped.  I would therefore like to keep you all updated as to where we stand with new joiners. 

Recent new recruits include: Rudi Zipter (Director - MRM) who has transferred from Houston, Shane Miller (Senior Specialist - MRM) and Ravi Tumuluri (Associate - U/W) and I would like to welcome them all to RAC.

Looking forward we have several new people coming on board in the next few months and I have outlined their provisional start dates below:

Credit
John Collenette (Snr Director) - 5 November
Mike Mumford (Director) - 3 September
Blair Van Zant (Director) - 1 October
Tracy Ngo (Director) - September
Simon Hockenhull (Snr Specialist) - 2 September
Adam Bauer (Specialist) - 27 August (Sydney office initially)
Shane Forster (Sr.Specialist) - 24 September

Market Risk 
Michel Gantois (Director) - December/January
Erik Beekman (Specialist) - 17 September

Underwriting
Christian Pearce (Associate) - 10 September

I realize that, in addition to increasing our capacity,  new starters also require a fair amount of indoctrination/training.   Many members of our team as well as RAC-Houston and much of EEL have put a large amount of time and effort in the selection of these people, all with the consideration of adding people that will fit in and provide some level of unique experience/insight.  We believe that these new starters will provide an excellent complement to our existing skill sets.  Please do your best to welcome these new people, take advantage of their capabilities as well as give them the benefit of your knowledge and experience.  Hopefully these additions will allow us to effect an intellectual capital transfer that benefits us all and makes this a better place to work in all respects.   

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Ted

Any suggestions on how you want RAC to administer this policy?

Jeff, please see my earlier e-mail today.  When I sent the first e-mail, we were going to own 49% of the trading Newco  I understand from the press, we will have no ownership under the UBS deal.   Therefore,  the policy will continue to protect against Counter-party defaults on those portions of the portfolio that we are retaining.  At some point we should advise insurers on the changes in ownership and the status of the portfolio as these would be "material changes " to what was originally underwritten. 

Bill Bradford is wanting someone to assume responsibility for "administration and reporting" under the policy.  To whom would you want to delegate this responsibility.  Bill Bradford's group produced the required quarterly reports and Bill was working on the PG&E claim.  Please advise.

I assume this does not affect past exposures since they are not being sold.  Why are we wanting to transfer this?this seems to be UBS; problem going forward.

I received a voice mail from Bill Bradford advising that you should be made aware of this issue as it is uncertain as to where Bill will reside as a result of the sale of the trading operations.  Please provide your thoughts.

The sale of the trading operation creates an issue with the "coverage" and  "named insured" wording on this policy, which must be addressed with the underwriters.  The change in ownership alone has a material underwriting effect which requires notice and discussion with insurers. 

 Enron will own only 49% of the trading going forward and the policy covers 100% of the counter-party credit exposure.  The new owner and entity are not insureds.  Would we want to approach underwriters with the request to continue the coverage for 100% and include the new owners and new entity as an insured or would we want to retain the coverage only for Enron's 49% exposure?

This is further complicated by the fact that the premium invested in the "finite layer" belongs to Enron and there are potential claims lodged against the program.  I don't have a current estimate on the PG&E exposure, however, depending on what is recovered from PG&E,  it could impact the first two layers of the insurance.  The Chubb layer (second layer) also has Directors and Officers Liability coverage included and it is exposed to current litigation. Due to the $100,000,000, aggregate in the Chubb Layer, it would provide additional coverage for both Credit and D&O going forward.

We need to meet and discuss.

Mr. Buy,

I want to say, "Thank you" for everything you did for RAC.

I have enjoyed working for a great group.  I have learned a lot from everyone in RAC.

Please let me know if anyone needs help.

Thanks again,

Subject:	EES Mass Market Processes


Thanks for each of your input on the proposed Mass Market process.  I have altered the flow chart to show the proposed new process only.   You will be notified shortly for a follow up meeting.

Key issues to move forward
IT - need consolidated report of agency executed deals in lieu of file for each deal
IT - update the batch process in RPS to capture and load counterparty by GCP ID
Data Capture - match of credit responses with data capture by order ID
Deal Capture - set up of reject letters for increased volume 
Deal Capture/Billing - clarify utility needs for counterparty name
Credit - interface with D&B Marketing Spectrum database
GCP - implement batch load of counterparts to database

Although it was discussed to use utility required name, Credit recommends to continue discussions with TPV or QC for validation of Legal name or consider data coverage source (D&B, Experian etc) and capturing utility name as an alias.  In order to securitize the portfolio, Legal names will be required.

Regards
Molly

PLEASE READ THIS IMPORTANT INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ENRON STOCK FUND IN THE ENRON CORP. SAVINGS AND ESOP PLANS

On Friday, January 11, trading of Enron stock was suspended on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  All Savings and ESOP Plan transactions, including 401(k) payroll contributions,  involving this fund were placed in a pending status until trading resumed.

As announced by Enron's Office of the Chair on Wednesday, January 16, Enron stock would now be traded Over The Counter (OTC).  Upon receiving this information, work began immediately to develop a process that allows for OTC trades in the plans.

On Thursday, January 17, Enron initiated a process to facilitate OTC trades of Enron stock inside the 401(k) and ESOP and all pending transactions were processed using Thursday's closing price.  

Now that trading has resumed, we urge you to review your investment elections to ensure that they are consistent with your investment goals.  

As things change, we will continue to update you.

1)       Standard & Poor's has released first-glance year-end results for our Corporate Default study 2001.  Details are provided below.  Final default statistics for 2001, including a list of all defaulted companies, will be published in more detail at the beginning of next month.
2)       Standard & Poor's recap of sovereign credit performance in 2001 is now available on our website.  Go to www.risksolutions.standardandpoors.com <http://www.risksolutions.standardandpoors.com/> scroll down to click the gray box for research and then click the link for  "Sovereign default and transition research"
 
The number of annual corporate defaults has exceeded 200 for the first time ever, with 211 issuers defaulting on approximately US$115.4 billion of debt through Dec. 31, 2001, according to the latest figures compiled for Standard & Poor's annual default study. This dwarfs the previous record set only last year when 132 issuers defaulted on US$42.3 billion of debt in 2000.
 
Significantly, 3.99% of all issuers defaulted during 2001, which essentially equals the previous record of 4.01% reached in 1991, when the universe of issuers was much smaller, and far surpasses 2000's 2.56% global default rate.  
 
8.57% of issuers that were speculative grade at the beginning of 2001 defaulted last year, compared to 5.68% in 2000, the highest speculative default rate since the record level of 10.87% set in 1991.
 
In a typical cycle defaults peak six months after an economic bottom.  Standard & Poor's believes the US economy will bottom in the first quarter of this year and then improve gradually.  We would expect to see continued high default rates, with defaults peaking at the beginning of the summer, when speculative grade default rates could reach 11%, and then trailing off at year end."
 
0.27% of issuers that were investment grade at the beginning of 2001 defaulted last year, which far surpasses 1991's 0.19% and 2000's 0.15%.  The record level of investment grade defaults, 0.28%, was set in 1982.  However, only 10.0% of issuers defaulting in 2001 were originally rated investment grade, well below the twenty-year average of 13.1%.  Defaults of issuers that were rated investment grade at that start of the year represented 5.06% of issuers defaulting during 2001, less than the twenty-year average of 5.24%.
 
The year began and ended with quarters marked by several very large defaults, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric in the first quarter and the well-publicized default of Enron in the fourth.  In dollar terms, these three issues alone accounted for approximately 20% of all defaults in 2001.
 
Defaults in 2001 were concentrated in the telecom sector, which accounted for 18.5% of all defaults.  Although telecom defaults began to ease at the end of last year, with only 6 reported in the 4th quarter.  In 2002 we expect defaults to be more broad-based than they were in 2001 although we'll see some concentrated weakness in certain areas of consumer products and retail. 
 
One hundred sixty-two defaults took place in the U.S., followed by Argentina with fifteen, Canada with nine, the U.K. with five, four in Australia, three in Poland and two in Mexico. One default each took place in Bermuda, Germany, Greece, Indonesia, Korea, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Russia, Thailand and Venezuela.
 
In Argentina 10 banks were classified as defaulting as a result of the government imposed limits on bank account withdrawals.  In 2002, the risk of additional defaults in Argentina will remain high as the economic turmoil runs its course.

Management Committee Members:

In light of today's meeting being canceled, we would like for you to give consideration to Jeff Huff as a candidate for Commercial Support VP.  Jeff has interviewed with Mark Frevert, Ray Bowen and Steve Kean who have given favorable feedback.  At this time, we would like to proceed with an offer.  Please contact us with any concerns or questions by the close of business Thursday.  If we have no opposing votes, we will proceed.

Below are a few points and a resume for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been working at Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

how about friday, feb ?? 1st or 2nd.  someone has packed me up and also trish/diane.  grrrr. so, i have got to go thru 40 boxes to find my stuff...haven't found my calendar yet.

trip was wonderful, but draining. being by myself to figure everything out was tiring.  highlites of trip:
paris - went to rodin museum twice.  bought a piece that i have a picture framed at the house.
brussels - really liked - pretty old european city with a square/plaza/piazza. very cold.
normandy area - long long story.  drove [will NEVER do that alone again in another country], had to deal with Plan G within about 2 hours, whole area shut down in january.  only me walking about.  very emotional for me.

will bring pics if you want to be bored.

where are you?  on holiday?

Rick,
As follow-up to our discussion of today, we would like to explain our concerns.
EEL entities are under control of an administrator - Price Waterhouse - who represents the interest of the creditors of those entities.
All decisions regarding those entities are being made by the administrator.  Michael Brown, Fernley Dyson, John Sherriff are not in the building and to the best of my knowledge have resigned all directorships.
Most of the remaining employees (300) are working for the administrator.  
There are, however, interests of Enron Corp which are housed in Enron House may not be getting the attention they deserve or , potentially more concerning, are being used or eyed by the locals for their benefit.

Examples are :
1) the contractual assets in ECTRIC which include financial trades, weather derivatives, nordic energy, some crude and products trading.
2) large in the money pumped storage trade which is in a US-based LLC - in the money by a net $50MM
3) Enron Direct is being offered for sale (JV with EES)
4) The TXU VPS contracts (currently under termination dispute) is being negotiated solely by administrators and their employees

Transactions are being terminated by counterparties, deals are being cut between the administrators and commercial for the dispostion of assets, and value is being eroded because no support staff will work without a reasonable expectation of being paid.  Finally, the administrators have been here for several weeks and seem woefully prepared to take on the task at hand.

We suggest that the Houston-based 'investor' (whether that is current managment or a trustee) ought to reconstitute some form of governance over its activities in Europe so that it can be assured of receiving maximum value for its assets here.  

Currently, we have little capability to cause the local staff to provide us with the information and access to make informed decisions.

Please give us a call so we can discuss a course of action, if any, you would like us to take.

Ted

1. Federal Appropriations For FY2002 R&D Up 13%
   -New Released AAAS Report Indicates

2. OMB Issues Information Quality Guidelines to Agencies
   -Higher Standard of Information Now Expected

3. State of Technology in Maryland to be Held in Annapolis

*****************************
FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR FY2002 R&D UP 13%

In FY 2002, research and development was funded at its largest dollar amount in U.S. history and the largest percentage increase in nearly 20 years, according to a recently released AAAS report.  Health, defense and counter-terrorism related research show the biggest gains.

For more information, see:  http://xserver.aaas.org/news/fedsupport.html

OMB ISSUES INFORMATION QUALITY STANDARDS TO AGENCIES
The Office of Management and Budget has issued guidelines to federal agencies to add information quality standards to the procedural requirements agencies must meet with regard to their disseminated information.  The agencies can be sued if information agencies disseminate or use to develop regulations, fails to meet OMB's standards.
At least 50 federal offices are covered by OMB's guidelines, including: the Environmental Protection Agency, the White House, the Department of Defense, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Labor, the Tennessee Valley Authority, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org. 


STATE OF TECHNOLOGY IN MARYLAND TO BE HELD IN ANNAPOLIS

ASME will join with the Technology Council of Maryland in co-sponsoring an annual gathering of Maryland lawmakers and industry leaders to discuss technology-based economic development.  This year's program will feature technology-based entrepreneurship.  Hear about challenges, accomplishments and opportunities from successful Maryland technology start-ups as well as examine how schools and universities are preparing future engineering, science and technology entrepreneurs. 

The summit will be held in Annapolis on February 4.  For program and registration details, go to http://www.asme.org/gric/
If you have additional questions, please contact Reese Meisinger at meisingerr@asme.org.


NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND BIOENGINEERING SEES FUNDING INCREASE

Congress increased the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)'s budget from its $2 million start-up funding in FY2001 to $40 million for FY2002, plus an additional $72 million in existing imaging and biomedical funding transferred to NIBIB from other national health institutes.  In report language, a nine-member extramural task force was called for to review bioengineering and imaging projects throughout the National Institutes of Health.  

For more information, please contact Melissa Murray at murraym@asme.org.


PRESIDENT SIGNS BROWNFIELDS LEGISLATION

Last week, President Bush signed legislation aimed at boosting clean up of brownfields, abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial properties.  Redevelopment of these properties is hindered by possible environmental contamination and potential liability.  The bill provides liability protection for contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners and authorizes increased funding for state and local programs that assess and clean up brownfields.  The legislation had bipartisan support.

The President also announced that his FY 03 budget will double the funds available through the EPA for FY02, to help states and communities around the country clean up and revitalize these sites.   Urban redevelopment and brownfields cleanup also will be funded at a level of $25 million through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

For more information, contact Kathryn Holmes at holmesk@asme.org.

PVRC'S WORKSHOP ON
TIGHTNESS-BASED BOLTED FLANGE 
GASKET CONSTANTS AND DESIGN RULES

February 6 & 7, 2002, Safety Harbor Florida


REGISTER NOW AND WATCH FOR FUTURE ANNOUNCEMENTS ON PVRC'S WEBSITE AT WWW.FORENGINEERS.ORG

Description

You must attend this workshop to help keep your job knowledge useful by understanding the new design rules for bolted flanged joints! Are you ready for the New Tightness-Based Gasket constants and flange design changes that are about to replace the traditional constants and rules?  This workshop will get you ready with focus on three critical areas that apply to both ASME Section VIII flanges and standard B16 Joints.

The New Tightness-Based Rules
Gasket Qualification and Selection
Latest On Analysis and Assembly of Bolted Joints

This Two-Day Workshop is a "must" for those needing  advance information and know-how about applying the recently developed gasket constants and flange design rules. The tightness-based rules accommodate levels of permissible joint leakage, representing a new basis for design criteria and opening additional choices and decisions for users and designers.  

Attendees will gain detailed knowledge about several topics focussing on the new gasket constants and design rules and particularly on issues relating to leakage criteria and associated choices.  The tightness concept is also extended to elevated temperature gasket qualification and selection, and know-how for efficient joint assembly and making zero leakage plant operation a realistic goal is presented.  Several industry experts will lead workshop sessions including: Bob Mikitka, Jim Payne, Michel Derenne, Yves Birembaut, Ron winter, Jerry Waterland, Rod Mueller, Anita Bausman, Jim Frew Hildegarde Zeres, Warren Brown, Ed Hayman, Bill Koves, and David Reeves. Attendees will receive a bound collection of the presentations and guidelines and recommendations.

This weekend marks the first employee move into our new office building, Enron Center South.

Approximately 400 Enron Global Markets employees will occupy the building's 3rd floor next Monday.  In the ensuing six weeks another 1,500 employees from Enron Industrial Markets, Enron Net Works, and our Power and Gas Marketers will follow, occupying levels 4, 5, and 6.

We know all employees are curious to experience this exciting new space.  HOWEVER, since Enron only has an occupancy permit for these specific floors, including limited access corridors from the skywalk, we ask that:

ONLY EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ASSIGNED OFFICE SPACE IN THE NEW BUILDING AND EMPLOYEES WITH STRICT BUSINESS NEEDS TO ACCESS OCCUPIED SPACE ARE PERMITTED TO BE IN THE NEW BUILDING.

Your compliance is appreciated and will assist in our ability to effectively conduct business by not over crowding newly occupied areas with visitors.  In addition, the balance of the building remains under construction and employees are strictly prohibited from entering these areas.

We are planning an open house in late Nov. or early Dec. so that every employee has the opportunity to see for themselves what is truly a world class commercial trading environment.  Thank you for your cooperation.

In light of the tragic events that occurred on September 11, 2001, our concern is to support our employees through this difficult time.  We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of a resource available to you, Enron's Employee Assistance Program.  This service is available to you or any member of your immediate family to provide counseling services.  To talk to a counselor, simply call (713) 853-6057 during business hours in Houston or the 24 hour service line at (800) 345-1391.  If you are outside the US, please contact your Human Resources Representative for further details.  Please also be aware of any colleagues who may require assistance during this time and may not be able to seek help for themselves.

Louise & John

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

Good evening, everyone.  Mike Peterson, who many of you have met and who is working with J.C. on your case, asked me to send the following e-mail to you:

The lawyers for Amalgamated Bank filed an amended class action complaint yesterday. Based on our initial comparison of the amended complaint versus the original one (our comparison was "line by line" but not "word for word"), it appears that the only change was to add four specific requests for relief at the very end of the complaint - namely, "to order an accounting of insider-trading proceeds," "disgorgement of insider-trading proceeds," "restitution of investors' monies of which they were defrauded," and "as to the section 11 claims, awarding rescission or a rescissionary measure of damages." These additions are technical in nature and probably were designed principally to preempt any copycat suits by other plaintiffs' attorneys. The amended complaint does not appear to contain any revision of the factual allegations or asserted causes of action. If you nonetheless would like your own copy of the amended complaint (all 78 pages), just let me know and I will send it to you.



This e-mail and any attached files may be confidential and subject to attorney/client privilege. If you received it in error, please immediately notify the sender by return e-mail or by calling (713)654-7600.

I wanted to recognize Keith for his quick response times during the last two weeks.  Keith understands the sense of urgency with some of these deals (i.e., when a customer wants to sign ASAP, it is important to get credit approved quickly and get a contract in front of the customer before the he/she changes his/her mind).  Thanks to Keith, we closed 7 deals in two weeks.

Thanks,
Rich.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ken Lay

Earlier today, I stepped down as Enron's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer.  This decision was reached in cooperation with Enron's Board and the Creditor Committee and is effective immediately.

To emerge from bankruptcy, Enron needs a CEO who can focus 100 percent of his or her efforts on rebuilding the company.  Unfortunately, with multiple inquiries and investigations that require my immediate attention, at this time I am unable to fully concentrate on what is most important to Enron's stakeholders - preserving value for our creditors and our dedicated employees.

The Creditor Committee has begun a search for a restructuring specialist to serve as interim CEO to help the company emerge from bankruptcy.  This individual will join Enron's remaining management team to direct the company's ongoing operations.

I truly believe Enron can and will survive.  I will remain a Director of the Board to help see that it does.

During my time at Enron, I have witnessed tremendous change and opportunity.  I have seen people rigorously grow and maintain one of the world's most efficient and safest gas pipeline networks; I have seen people dedicate themselves to a cause that became a passion - the opening of energy markets; I have observed smart people come together as a team to build creative solutions like EnronOnline; and I have watched people tirelessly give of themselves to help their fellow employees and those in the community.  Regardless of what has happened, I am proud of so much of what we were able to accomplish here.

Thank you for your contributions to the company and for the inspiration you have been to me over the years.

Ken Lay

Subject:   New Dialing Instructions
 
Ref:   Tie Line Access Code Changes - Enron Building Phone System
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, the access code for remote locations will be modified within the Enron Building phone system to reflect a standard utilized by all Enron phone systems.  The modification will change the first digit dialed when accessing the tie lines by using the Alternative Routing feature from 7 to 8.  As all other Enron phone systems currently access the tie lines with the digit 8, the change from 7 to 8 will only affect users who reside in the Enron Building.  All other Enron phone system users should note that several digits of the tie lines to London, Calgary, and Portland have changed.
 
What This Change Means To You
 
Effective Saturday, August 18, you must replace the first digit 7 with an 8 when accessing the tie lines.  Additionally, several of the digits to the London, Calgary, and Portland tie lines have changed.  All other digits of existing access codes will remain the same.  For your reference, a list of the new dial strings for remote locations is identified at the bottom of this message.  Please Note:  This change also means that any Auto-Dial buttons you use to call associates at remote locations will now have to be re-programmed.  Such buttons may be programmed on conference room phones and FAX machines in your area.
 
To re-program an Auto-Dial button:
 
?         Press the Menu button on your soft keys
?         Press the Program button on your soft keys
?         Press the Auto-Dial button you wish to program
?         Dial the new Dial String (as identified below)
?         Press the # key
 
REVISED DIAL STRINGS FOR ENRON TIE LINE NETWORK

John, the prior conversations concerning these assets indicated that the non-JEDI 2 ownership of some of these assets resided in the WhiteWing structure. WhiteWing also involves outside equity, and in addition to other concerns, has limitations on sales below contributed value [the book value on the transfer to WhiteWing]. Given the current situation concerning related party transactions, I recommend approval from the Enron Corp. Board prior to any related party transaction, as well as the approval of JEDI 2 and in the case of WhiteWing, at least a majority of the outside equity.

Teresa, if these activities are under active consideration, I suggest we schedule meetings with Mark Haedicke and Jeff McMahon.

Because of the current issues Enron is having with related party transactions, such a sale will require Enron as GP of JEDI II, to obtain the LPs consent - obviously this mean CalPERS as I am assuming we would consent to our own deal.  I have spoken with CalPERS briefly regarding the proposed sale and they do not seem immediately inclined to permit such a sale.  Please give me a call so we can discuss.  Thanks.  Shirley x34859

The originator who closed that deal in 1998 (or thereabouts) left a year ago or more, Sandra McDonald I believe. I can have Mike Garberding look into it if you like as he is very familiar with these structures. Jeff's issue, he called me as well, is that we post to APEA monthly yet Chase posts to Enron daily (or vice versa depending on the market) which can cause large exposures both ways. It's probably a good idea from both of our sides to correct that from a liquidity and credit perspective. I'll ask Mike to see if anyone left at Enron is familiar with APEA to open this discussion with them. The difficult part may be amending the margin agreement as I would assume these documents were pledged to the municipal bond holders.

Jeff Delapino (sp?) from Chase has asked me to look into the above transaction to change from monthly collateralization to daily. Do you know who is familiar with this deal? Rick

Due to the release of schedule C for ENA and EES, the attached spreadsheet provides the trading p&l without prudency and the associated Daily Loss Limit notifications.  Additionally, the spreadsheet reflects the net effect on the Total Trading line.  If the Corp. Var remains at $100mm, then a Daily Loss Limit notification would be sent out.  However, the current opinion is that the Corp. Var is $150mm, including discretionary Var, which eliminates the notification.

Please let me know if you have any quetions.

Thanks,
Chris Abel

Rick/Bill
The steel team (Bruce Garner et al) here is considering a credit insurance product to support their sales into uk market.  Paul Maley, who is from the insurance world, has been part of the discussions and believes that there is a viable product for a portion of the business.  Not a fix for long-dated mark-to-market exposure out of Russia, but probably could release some credit capacity for sales to weak industry names on a delivered/unpaid basis into first world legal environments.  A bit pricey but may be less expensive on a per $ basis if lots of transactions.  He has been in touch with David Marshall in Global Risk Managment (Houston Insurance guy).  I suggested that Paul and I get together with you guys to go through in some detail.   This is encouraging that people are working on such things, but it would be great if we set the pace and organized the process.  Speak to you tomorrow or Thurs.

We made an $8mm margin call today and New Power disputed the mark.  They will be posting $2mm and we are working to reconcile the differences which we believe are in the gas marks.

Tim,

Can you rough out a slide on rating agencies?  I also want to update liquidity with some comments about LCs and refinancing requirements including Rawhide, Bank RC, Marlin and Osprey.  We probably have to discuss trade behavior and margin.

	The resume for Jeff Huff was inadvertently dropped from the message we sent yesterday evening.  The resume is attached below for your convenience.  

Below are a few points for your review:

Resume: Currently the second most productive Partner at Diamond-Cluster, a technology consulting firm. He has been a consultant dedicated to Enron for the last 2+ years, first for Tom Gros in EBS and Net Works and then for Dan Reck in Freight, developing trading systems. 
The Job: We are looking to bring Jeff in as VP, Commercial Support.  The demands of growing the group require a consistent focus on technology, expenses, front and back office productivity, as well as constant re-analysis of growth strategies. 
Justification: Jeff's capabilities in these areas make him extremely qualified. We rely on him heavily already, but at consulting rates he costs us more than $1.3mm per year and his focus is limited to technology. Most importantly, the lead commercial folks in the group are overburdened with administrative issues and spending too little time bringing in earnings. 
Thank you. 
Mike and Jeff

All,

We had a preliminary meeting on Friday.  The attached is a summary of the matrix we developed as well as changes from subsequent e-mails.  Note, only one name has been placed in the matrix where two may have been suggested - if the name is not correct then please e-mail me back as soon as possible - only person per box please.  The names placed in the matrix will be directly responsible to the estate.

We need to meet Monday to: (1) agree on the matrix; (2) develop detailed processes for capturing value (trade books, structured deals, hard assets and business sales); (3) understand the approval process required on a go forward basis; (4) develop compensation / retention program for estate, (5) address any administrative concerns.

If you have not done so, please check the names in the matrix to ensure that they are correct and please send me any changes as well as their full names to be utilized for future e-mails.

Regards,

Jim

Steve,

Make sure that we circulate a DASH on the disposition of the QWEST note which we discussed on Friday.  I want to reinforce the concept of RAC signoff of asset sales, including the sale of financial assets such as notes and receivables.

When can we close the sale?

Thanks.

Ray

Subject: EH&S Data Management and Process Safety Management Technology Sem
inar
Date: 13 September 2001 14:00
Priority: High

Every quarter or so, Data Systems & Solutions hosts seminars to educate
clients in the process industries on the value of integrated environmental,
health & safety management information systems (EMIS).  Our last seminar on
May 3, 2001 resulted in over 30 clients attending.

We are planning two additional seminars this year (Integrating Process
Safety Management - October 11th) and (Integrated EH&S Solutions - November
6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For
instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a "hot" topic
right now.  Overall, the top three interests we are hearing from our
customers on the topic of EMIS include:

1. Sustainable Development "Triple Bottom Line" coupled with Key Performance
Metrics/Roll-Up Reporting
2. Integrating Information Systems with EMIS
3. Risk Reduction

The ever looming concern over cost justification has become much clearer and
will be addressed in future seminars.  Even today, there is no "panacea" for
EH&S software applications.  Most vendors address the "E" picture or the
"H&S" picture, but do not cover both holistically.  With emerging
information technology protocols such as extensible markup language (XML) it
is now possible to get a true "best of breed" solution that will allow you
to "plug and play" modules instead of hoping for everything in one software
vendor.  Unfortunately, the EMIS software marketplace still remains
unconsolidated and there are inherent risks with selecting a software
vendor.  The goal of our one day seminar is to address all of these concerns
and to help our customers to understand what is involved in a typical EMIS
project...from an initial assessment of your needs, to determining the value
of an EMIS and the core reasons for doing it, to selecting systems where
gaps exist, to allocating proper resources to ensure a successful project,

Rick,

Our group has completed our new investment strategy and are preparing to move into the execution phase.  I would appreciate the opportunity to present the strategy to you, Dave Gorte and Randy Petersen.  It would take about 1 hour, and I would value your feedback.  Let me know if you are up for it, and I will have my assistant schedule it.

Thanks,
KG

Rick

One question we are often asked is how do security and risk relate?  Risk is the potential reduction in asset values from threats and vulnerabilities. Security is an ability you possess to protect specific assets in specific way(s).

So the answer is:  Security is able to reduce risk in specific areas but without the full breadth of risk defined it is impossible to determine how significant security solutions are.

Stay Safe

Tim,
I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08 
Taxes withheld = $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.  

I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not doing any work for Enron at the moment.

Ted

Hi Ted:  Last week you ask about the allocation of the RAC budget to Europe.  The Ken Lay budget presentation for 2002 has been postponed a few days so Rick B. plans to review the numbers in detail when he returns so there may be some changes.  However, based on what we have so far, shown below is the % allocation that we were provided by each RAC group applied to the revised (10% reduction) RAC budget.  Also shown is the current allocation for 2001.  Please let me know if you think there are any issues and I will get you more detail.   Regards!   Rick C.

I am not sure where anyone is in this process, but, as soon as you have an inkling, would you please give me an idea of what the allocation of the RAC budget to Europe will be and what the methodology for determing?  I am sure that this will be a number that will be looked hard at by Michael Brown.
Thanks
Ted

Court would have to approve any reduction or significant change that we would do outside the normal course of business - short answer probably no on the non-compete otherwise we are down to 100 people have at it.

Have you had any more thoughts about joining HYC ?  (in between other probl=
ems)

If you're interested, this is a pretty good party (even if you're not inter=
ested in HYC it's some good lobster)

Let me know

Talked to Baxter Saturday night at the Commodore's Ball
He wants to know when we're going to fight back

When you're done insert fresh backtesting stuff (graphs and data) and the following form of words to Steve Allen (allenste@rcn.com <mailto:allenste@rcn.com>) and Bruce Hiller

"Steve

Following on from our discussion concerning the back testing data, we have re-checked the underlying data with our middle office. There were some errors in your file which we have now corrected, and for clarity, included losses in the backtest file, since these are what we consider in the backtest process. 

I trust this helps - let us know if you need anything further

Get Rick to clear this first.

Gentlemen:

	Bob and I would like to schedule a joint session of the Audit and Finance
Committees, perhaps at the August meeting, to cover the following topics
(and any others which occur to you):

1.	how and why are the trading and investment policies (and levels specified
therein) established;

2.	how and why are the VAR and maximum expected loss limits set;

3.	how useful is the VAR methodology as it is extended outside of the
wholesale gas and electricity business.

	It would also be useful to update the Committees on the post-audits of
recent investments and perhaps on the larger "asset" investments such as
Dabhol, Electrol, Cuiaba, etc.  Even as we move away from these investments,
there may be some additional lessons to be learned.  Does our post-audit
process and procedure continue?

	We could meet briefly in May to discuss the idea of a joint meeting and the
proposed agenda, if that is convenient.

	Best regards.

Standard & Poor's and RiskMetrics to Develop Integrated Credit Risk Product

 
Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions and the RiskMetrics Group today announced plans to integrate two of their credit risk products 
 
The two firms will build an interface between Standard & Poor's CreditModel?, an Internet-accessible credit scoring model for public and private firms, and RiskMetrics' CreditManager, a credit portfolio risk measurement, analysis and reporting tool.  The interface will allow customers to access CreditModel? analytics and generate obligor credit scores directly from within CreditManager. 
 
CreditModel? is a series of industry and region specific credit scoring models that give users the ability to quickly and easily generate high quality evaluations of an organization's creditworthiness. While not actual credit ratings, the scores reflect Standard & Poor's credit analysis experience in each sector.


CreditManager is a stand-alone application for the measurement and analysis of portfolio Value-at-Risk (VaR) due to credit events including upgrades, downgrades and defaults. CreditManager implements the industry standard CreditMetrics? methodology and enables banks, fund managers and other financial institutions to consolidate credit risk across their entire organizations.
 
Risk Solutions, www.risksolutions.standardandpoors.com, the customized credit risk services arm of Standard & Poor's, provides customized credit risk solutions, models and data to help clients manage their risk.  If you have any further questions about Risk Solutions, or if a colleague would like to be added to our mailing list, please write to us at risksolutions@standardandpoors.com and include your full contact information. 
 
We use your contact information to keep you informed of research, products and services from the Standard & Poor's and McGraw-Hill families of companies.

Louise,

Attached is a new table derived from the list we reviewed on Thursday.

This table, combined with the BoD approved Transaction Approval Process (TAP) on the RAC Website (rac.corp.enron.com), should provide originators in the Americas with a roadmap for seeking spending approval and indicate where authority and responsibility lies for such approval.  (FYI, the TAP is likely to change at the next board meeting--I'll send you a revised version next week.)

The next step is an initiative to improve spending controls by linking DASH approved levels to the Accounting and Treasury systems.  Rick Carson will be heading up this project and coordinating with Accounting and Treasury for support.

Please distribute this as you see fit within your team.  Let me know if any changes are required.

 
Regards,

Chip Schneider

One of my colleagues, Jon Cummings (a partner from McKinsey's Johannesburg
office), and his client team from Anglo American would like to visit with
certain individuals at Enron.  They would like to meet with each of you on
a "best practices visit" to the US.  They are trying to understand how
Enron manages corporate center structure and role, performance management,
and people proposition.

Anglo American is the global leader in mining and natural resources.  It
has significant interests in gold, platinum, diamonds, coal, base and
ferrous metals, industrial minerals, and forest products.  The group is
geographically located in Africa, Europe, South and North America, and
Australia.  They will be visiting several companies on this trip including
Johnson & Johnson, BP, and Emerson.

Would you be able to let us schedule an hour with you to meet with Jon
Cummings (Director, McKinsey), along with Philip Baum (COO, South Africa),
David Hathorne (MD, Mondi Europe) and several HR people?

My assistant, Carol Benter, will be in touch with your assistants to try to
schedule this meeting for July 16 or 17.  Please contact Carol Benter
(713/751-4378), or me (713/751-4390) if you have any questions about this
request and thank you for your time and consideration.

First of all my thanks to Vladimir for visit to PGE and the analysis work he did.  After reviewing your PGE Summary memo, I think it would be helpful to meet and discuss the Recommendation/Action Steps in more detail.  

I will have my assistant call to establish a mutually agreeable time.

At the last RAC Departmental meeting concern was expressed that the vacant positions within RAC were not being filled as quickly as hoped.  I would therefore like to keep you all updated as to where we stand with new joiners. 

Recent new recruits include: Rudi Zipter (Director - MRM) who has transferred from Houston, Shane Miller (Senior Specialist - MRM) and Ravi Tumuluri (Associate - U/W) and I would like to welcome them all to RAC.

Looking forward we have several new people coming on board in the next few months and I have outlined their provisional start dates below:

Credit 
John Collenette (Snr Director) - 5 November 
Mike Mumford (Director) - 3 September 
Blair Van Zant (Director) - 1 October 
Tracy Ngo (Director) - September 
Simon Hockenhull (Snr Specialist) - 2 September 
Adam Bauer (Specialist) - 27 August (Sydney office initially) 
Shane Forster (Sr.Specialist) - 24 September 

Market Risk 
Michel Gantois (Director) - December/January 
Erik Beekman (Specialist) - 17 September 

Underwriting 
Christian Pearce (Associate) - 10 September 

I realize that, in addition to increasing our capacity,  new starters also require a fair amount of indoctrination/training.   Many members of our team as well as RAC-Houston and much of EEL have put a large amount of time and effort in the selection of these people, all with the consideration of adding people that will fit in and provide some level of unique experience/insight.  We believe that these new starters will provide an excellent complement to our existing skill sets.  Please do your best to welcome these new people, take advantage of their capabilities as well as give them the benefit of your knowledge and experience.  Hopefully these additions will allow us to effect an intellectual capital transfer that benefits us all and makes this a better place to work in all respects.   

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. 

Ted

e need to think about what risk tolerance we are comfortable with accepting=
 to help grow this business.

I agree we have had the foresight to focus on building the necessary skills=
 to support the business growth but have not done a good job of proactively=
 communicating the credit risks inherent in the international businesses.  =
Both Tom Moran and Ken Curry have decent experience in international trade =
and l/c's but have not taken a proactive enough approach with the business =

sponsibility, both Debbie Brackett and David Hardy have more international =
trade experience than most in the marketplace.

Effectively the International Credit Group is well structured with the cred=

Metals
Curry/Rohauer/Maley/Nelson/Suttle - EIM

This is a very detailed business and I think we have lacked the coordinatio=

Rick,
While I am not 100% sure of what Greg means by international credit, both B=

t we are not net long vis-a-vis the direction of the business, particularly=
 the non-energy commodity businesses - steel, metals, paper - as well as th=

rld.  Knowledge of the subleties of l/c language, insurance products, dog c=
ounterparties, typical scams, money launderers, lay ranges, demurrage....To=
 that end, we both interviewed and subsequently hired John Collenette, head=
 of credit for an international trading organization - Trafigura.  John spe=
nt 10 years at Paribas and then the last 7 at Trafigura.  He went through 3=
 full rounds of interviews, primarily with the metals guys and incuding Mic=
hael Brown.  My plan was to install him as the 'team lead' in metals allowi=
ng him to get 'enronized' with the idea that he would expand his role to in=
clude global products and EIM.  I guess I will accelerate this process.
In addition, I have also hired a sr spec with metals experience from Koch. =
 We have interviewed a few other prospects with transactional credit experi=
ence.  We are planning to supplement some of this industry knowledge with T=
racy Ngo and a few strong managers with solid credit skills.  The issues we=
 have yet to begin getting traction are how to staff other offices - NY and=
 Sydney principally.  Here we are constrained by current budgets.

Also, I have worked with the operations staff to take away some of the oper=
ational credit issues like chasing down information, money laundering check=
s, calling  for margin, and opening accounts so that we can hire credit pro=
fessionals to analyze credits and deals. =20

Finally, a critical piece of the puzzle is to also strengthen the people an=
d the processes around the logistics of credit - specifically, the logistic=
s function, treasury (l/c issuance/acceptance), and risk management.  It is=
 in the hand-offs of infomation where most of the risk lies, in my opinion.=
 =20

When you are here, we ought to make that a topic for discussion.  Not to ov=
er-state the need, I think it will require somewhat of an on-going focused =
effort and coordination between offices and departments similar to the EES =

Janet:

Lisa and I, along with Paul Darmitzel in EES legal, have been making good progress on the bankruptcy front.   Today, we met to review the progress on the collection of past due accounts, in particular the numerous accounts which are catch-up work.    It has come to our attention that we need a dedicated attorney and paralegal to assist account management in reviewing and terminating many of these accounts.  I understand that Vicki has been consumed with the Dynegy events,  Rick Buy suggested I contact you directly to request resources.   We would expect this resource need to be somewhat transitory.   If you could call me at x33820, I would appreciate it.

Regards,



Michael

Hi, Rick---If you don't mind, Lyn's asked that you join him at The Hyatt (am thinking the bar might just come in handy)---in front of the escalator in the lobby.  As I indicated, he's 6'3", has reddish hair, and is purported to be rather muscular.  Hope you're preparing a description for me---will call you shortly to confirm.  (He's aware that you're suitless---and the resume's not even remotely an issue.)  Talk to you soon---thx!   mb

The quarterly valuations for the assets hedged in the Raptor structure were valued through the normal quarterly revaluation process.  The business units, RAC and Arthur Andersen all signed off on the initial valuations for the assets hedged in Raptor.  All the investments in Raptor were on the MPR and were monitored by the business units and  we prepared the Raptor position report based upon this information.  The MPR report now reflects that the hedged assets are not in Raptor.

Please contact me if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Gordon

Ben,
I met with Rick Buy and several members of his group last week to discuss the buyout and what the remaining exposures to Enron were.  As the Raptor DPR's were generally taking hedged values directly from ENA's MPR, they were going to discuss the valuation on those assets with Dick Lydecker.  I haven't heard anything else from RAC since that meeting.  Let me know if there is anything I can do to further this process.  Thanks,
Ron

I think that all investments that were hedged in Raptor are on th MPR and are being monitored and reported against.  Is this true?  Ron, will you take the lead in making sure we have a smooth transition on this?  Thanks

Now that Raptor is blown up, should we begin valuation efforts of assets and include in merchant portfolio. I am not familiar with details of how it unwound so I don't know what we are left with. Is this worth a meeting with you or your designesss? Rick

Get ready.  Beginning in November, electronic pay stubs will be available to all employees who have their paychecks direct deposited into their bank account.  Electronic pay stubs are an easy, fast, and efficient way for you to get your payroll information.  They will also help Enron to realize a considerable savings in time and dollars spent over traditional printed pay stubs.

If you prefer to receive a hardcopy of your pay stub, click on the link below to complete a request form.  This form must be submitted to Payroll by October 15, 2001.  Unless you submit a form your pay stub information will default to electronic viewing.

Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions and Risk Data Bank to develop a scoring model for Japanese SME's
 
Standard & Poor's Risk Solutions today announced that it has formed a strategic alliance with The Risk Data Bank of Japan Limited (RDB), a leading provider of credit risk data, to jointly develop the first advanced scoring model to assess the creditworthiness of Japanese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
 
The advanced scoring model will be fully developed by June 2002 and will leverage Standard & Poor's analytic strength and global credit experience, and RDB's comprehensive database of financial information and robust default data.
 
As a membership organization, RDB has, to date, operated by aggregating financial and company data on SMEs gathered from its 38 member institutions. Member banks in turn, gain access to RDB's database and scoring models, and use the information to internally rate the financial positions of unlisted companies. 
 
Standard & Poor's and RDB will work together to further develop the scoring model, as well as collaborate to improve the quality of recovery data and develop analytics for a recovery rate estimation model. 
 
Risk Solutions is the credit risk services arm of Standard & Poor's.  If you have any further questions about Risk Solutions, or if a colleague would like to be added to our mailing list, please write to us at risksolutions@standardandpoors.com and include your full contact information.

Rick:  Thanks for reviewing the budget.  Donna's group is included in the Portfolio group numbers along with my people here on the 28th floor.  Assurance Services is the budget for the work Arthur Andersen performs reviewing RAC's controls, procedures, etc.  We are pretty much obligated to take it although we turn around and allocate the cost to the business units we serve.  As far as the presentation in concerned, we are working with the RAC VP's to get a couple of bullet points from each for their key 2002 objectives to include in the presentation.  We will wrap that up tomorrow and I will get the presentation to you to review.  Please call if you have questions.   Rick C.

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

Below are some ideas I have re EES risk monitoring.  If you would like to discuss, please call. 

Monitor Enron's Bundled and T&D load % behind a utility.
One of Enron's biggest risk factors in California relates to Enron's percentage of the utility/state ESP business.  EES and EEMC together were 80 - 90 % of the total ESP load behind PG&E and SCE.  This is great unless things go bad, i.e. California.  RAC at a minimum needs to monitor this % on a go forward basis, as well as consider some sort of limit structure.  I know that Todd Busby and Malik are working to include the "utility code" as part of the retail short positions.   Once the retail short positions can be aggregated by utility, RAC should consider monitoring the retail load as a percentage of the utilities total load.  We should remain aware of the regulatory vulnerability Enron has if we become the only group impacted by future rate or rule changes. 
Credit - Cash Flows 
I continue to request cash flows for all counterparties be reported gross, not net.  Todd is working to provide for this in project Everest.  In the future, cash flows associated with T&D, and bundled tariffs should be provided to credit as with all other counterparties.  If credit can obtain a netting agreement with the utility to net wholesale commodity sales to the utility and T&D and Bundled tariff's "purchases", this could substantially reduce Enron's credit exposure on wholesale transactions and provide credit capacity that other marketers or generators might not have. 
T&D Tariffs
Dale Furrow has joined EWS to focus on tariff curves.  RAC needs to work closely with Dale re this.  I would suggest at a minimum, RAC require that T&D curves reflect the current tariff or higher.   I believe it would be premature to forecast a decrease in the current tariff rates, without an active rate case.  A suggestion for a VAR like number for T & D would be to calculate the impact of a % increase from the current tariff.  RAC should require validation that the curves equal the current tariffs. I will work EES re this validation. 
Bundled Tariffs
Since this obviously does include a component for energy, the build-up of the forward curve should involve RAC.  RAC should require at a minimum, the starting point equals the current tariff and review the assumptions re changes to these forward curves.  This will require a fundamental understanding of the utilities generation sources, i.e. coal, nuclear, gas.  I would also like to see a validation process, that includes a sign-off from regulatory affairs, especially as it relates to de-regulation assumptions.  We had begun implementation of  these, but with all the changes, some of this has been put on the back burner.  Through Todd,  I have asked to be included in meetings re this new tariff curve application.   

Maybe we should discuss these in one of our EES meetings?

Wanda

At this time, I am NOT sharing the RAC updated valuation numbers with ECR (and have told Jesus that).
It would seem like ECR should no longer be privy to that type of ENE info.

Ellen - suggest you handle your valuation tables confidentially also.

Comments anyone  ???

Ellen and I just spoke and she is putting together some information regarding the range of values, size of the transaction, etc. that I would suggest we include with the memo seeking approval of the potential conflict of interest and describing the procedures being implemented to assure fairness in process and valuation.  Does that sound like the plan?  Suggestions?

Teresa and I spoke with Sharon Butcher today who recommended that the potential sale of E&P portfolio should be described and approved at this preliminary stage by Lavorato, Haedicke, Goerte, and Lay et al per policy regarding conflicts. A DASH would follow when the deal gets further along. The issue here is John Thompson and other employees potentially "negotiating a deal" which would include their getting equity in the company which purchases assets. Donna and I just spoke and our thoughts are that the deal description currently in draft form would be circulated with an approval cover sheet explaining the reason for the approval sought.

FYI - Teresa and  I are meeting with the HR rep and the Enron employment attorney this aft and then all with John so that he understands what process should be followed re the employees - ie his communications with them and with potential purchasers. NAncy

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK

Every quarter or so, Data Systems & Solutions hosts seminars to educate
clients in the process industries on the value of integrated environmental,
health & safety management information systems (EMIS).  Our last seminar on
May 3, 2001 resulted in over 30 clients attending.  

We are planning two additional seminars this year (Integrating Process
Safety Management - October 11th) and (Integrated EH&S Solutions - November
6th).  We vary topics/vendors to meet the needs of the marketplace.  For
instance, you will notice that Sustainable Development is a "hot" topic
right now.  Overall, the top three interests we are hearing from our
customers on the topic of EMIS include:

1. Sustainable Development "Triple Bottom Line" coupled with Key Performance
Metrics/Roll-Up Reporting
2. Integrating Information Systems with EMIS
3. Risk Reduction

The ever looming concern over cost justification has become much clearer and
will be addressed in future seminars.  Even today, there is no "panacea" for
EH&S software applications.  Most vendors address the "E" picture or the
"H&S" picture, but do not cover both holistically.  With emerging
information technology protocols such as extensible markup language (XML) it
is now possible to get a true "best of breed" solution that will allow you
to "plug and play" modules instead of hoping for everything in one software
vendor.  Unfortunately, the EMIS software marketplace still remains
unconsolidated and there are inherent risks with selecting a software
vendor.  The goal of our one day seminar is to address all of these concerns
and to help our customers to understand what is involved in a typical EMIS
project...from an initial assessment of your needs, to determining the value
of an EMIS and the core reasons for doing it, to selecting systems where
gaps exist, to allocating proper resources to ensure a successful project,
to implementing the solution, to integrating with other facility information
systems, and maintenance and training.

Let us know if you or anyone from your organization are interested in
attending our seminar.  We want to give you the most value possible in our
one day educational forum.  Please let us know if there is anything in
particular that you would like to get information on that may not be covered
in the topics listed on the agenda.

EMIS services.

We have extended the campaign for three more days!

As of this morning, we are at 91.69% of our goal and 70% participation.  The 70% participation rate includes those who have completed the on-line pledge process, but may not have contributed (427 out of 4,655 have chosen not to contribute).  The contribution rate is 64%.  We also have a total of 56 Alexis de Tocqueville members which surpasses last year's total of 49.  Out of those 56, 19 are new members!  The next three days are crucial to exceeding our $2.9M goal.  Thanks for all that you can do to help make this happen.  Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks, Kathy

Subject:	2002 Corporate Allocations to EIM


Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

How well do you know our Code of Ethics?

"It is a condition of employment that each employee accept the responsibility of complying with the foregoing policies.  The Company will require each employee of the Company to complete and submit a statement in a form designated by the Company pertaining to such employee's compliance with the policies set forth in this booklet.  The Company reserves the right to request any employee to complete and submit such statement at any time or as frequently as the Company may deem advisable."
(Enron Code of Ethics, July 2000, page 62)

What does that mean?

In layman's terms, everyone employed by Enron agrees to all the policies and standards listed in the current Code of Ethics (July 2000).

Who does it apply to?

The Code of Ethics applies to all employees, third party contractors, guests and licensees of Enron.  Additionally, employees are responsible for their family members and/or personal household who use, own, or have access to Enron's communication services and equipment -- including telephones, fax machines, computers, computer modems, long distance telephone services, cell phones, voice mail, pagers, e-mail, mail and delivery services.

What about my privacy?

Don't expect privacy when using Enron's equipment or services -- whether the activity is business or non-business related.  For example, don't use Enron's equipment to send or receive personal messages that you don't want monitored or accessed by the government, third parties or Enron.  In a nutshell, if you want privacy, don't use Enron's equipment.

Are there repercussions for non-compliance?

Yes.  An employee who violates any of the policies in the Code of Ethics is subject to disciplinary action, including suspension or termination of employment, and can include legal action if Enron believes it to be appropriate under the circumstances.

Rick:  In addition to our normal activities related to board reporting, PortRAC maintenance, compliance and SWAT work, we have the following major project initiatives underway:

DASH SPENDING CONTROLS - We are leading the team to develop an "AFE-type" cost accumulation system so that every project in Enron will have accurate and timely cost expenditure numbers to ensure that appropriate DASH's and approval levels have been obtained.

BANKRUPTCY REPORTING DATA - We have taken responsibility for developing the reporting function for the new bankruptcy group.  We are working with Michael T. and Credit to develop what data we need, where in the organization we get it and what kind of reports we generate with it.

POST TRANSACTION REVIEWS -  We will provide the primary resources to perform these Board mandated reviews.  Paper mills, Garden State and Daishowa will be reviewed this quarter in conjuction with Underwriting.

EES - We are working with Credit to monitor the EES project list as well as assisting them in some counterparty and credit scoring work related to EES's mass marketing effort.

PortRAC ENHANCEMENTS - We have completed the executive demos with very positive comments about the functionality of the system.  Some of them (including Louise Kitchen) commented that they missed their hard copy snapshots so we are enhancing PortRAC to make it easier to print an entire snapshot book for a business unit with the "push of a button".

If you have any other "big" projects that you want us to tackle, please let me know.   Thanks,     Rick C.

The Enron Building in Houston will be closed for the rest of the day.  The offices in New York and Washington, D.C. have also been closed, and all employees have been accounted for.  We're asking all Houston-based employees not involved in critical operations to go home to be with their families.  We have every reason to believe the Enron Building is safe and secure.  Each Enron location has the discretion to determine what is in the best interest of their employees.  We know of no Enron employee or facility affected by today's tragic events.  Let's keep all the victims of these tragedies in our thoughts and prayers.

Rick --

Our baby, Addison Sterling, was born on Saturday, January 12th at 12:31 PM.  She was fairly big - 8 lbs 14 ozs and she is 20 inches long.  I've attached a link to the hospital's website that has her picture (she is much cuter in person, of course :)

We named her after Addison St which runs by Wrigley Field (Home of the Chicago Cubs) and the Pound Sterling.

Cami is doing well and we have returned home on Sunday night.

Subject:	FW: EOGIL sale to BG

Jeff,  FYI here is the game plan for EOGIL and the sale to BG.  
1) It appears that we have the fundamental support of the creditor committee to sign the BG deal for India. (See Tim's note below)
2) I spoke to Ray by telephone(on his way to the airport) regarding the questions Lilly Chu had outlined when she spoke to Tim Detmering.
3) To paraphrase Ray's comments to my note below, a) he is working with the creditors' committee on the D&O issues and both the committee and Ray want to put a broader program in place to handle our concerns for the asset sales and the on-going business.  At this point we are in good faith proceeding with the sale with the assumption that this will be sorted out before we sign the deal in mid-February.  b) the deal compensation should sort itself out as the appropriate people review the information they have been given over the weekend and today.  As a non-debtor we plan to honor the agreements, but we will supply Lilly et al with the information they need to understand the deal in place. 
4) With these understandings we are proceeding forward to sign the documents with BG and file a motion with the court.
4) Brian Rosen is drafting the motion for the court and he will circulate it tomorrow for comments and expect to file it ASAP.  The hearing date will be in mid-February.
5) Tim is in discussions with BG and the only outstanding issue is the escrow "form of agreement".  This will be either resolved this evening or put to the side until closing since it is not needed for signing.  However, BG is making noise that they would like to finalize it if possible before signing this evening. 
6) THEREFORE ASSUMING THE STARS ALIGN and WE SIGN THE DEAL TONIGHT, BG WILL BE ISSUING A PRESS RELEASE TOMORROW.  A COPY IS ATTACHED.  WE HAVE SENT IT THROUGH PR (John Ambler & Johan Zaayman) and the working group and now the two of you.  Do we need to send it elsewhere?   

We'll circulate a short note if and when we execute the documents.

If you have any questions or comments please contact Tim, Stephen or I.

With respect to the note below,  we have done the following this morning.  
1) We have provided Mary Jean Potenzone with Weil samples of the documents for her review.  There are a couple of different documents (Retention agreements & divestiture agreements) and the only differences being names and amounts.  We have also sent her any associated agreements, extensions and assignment.  She indicated she would review this afternoon.  My understanding is she is the conduit to Millbank.  

2) None of the people on this list participated in the pre-petition retention Lilly has asked about.  Futhermore, none of these people are part of the future plan (if there is one) to the best of my knowledge.

3) On D&O, supposedly Lilly said they discussed this and the creditors' see the need for such a plan but they don't want a one off plan as well.  It would be good to get someone on behalf of the creditors to send us a written note along these lines.  

4)  Once we have the compensation and the D&O issue resolved, we can notify BG and sign this deal.  I suggest you call Lilly and get closure on these two issues (ok on bonuses & letter in lieu of D&O policy) if you can.

5) Brian is drafting the motion and he just informed us that neither of these issues need to be in the motion, they are just creditor committee issues.

Just spoke with Lilly Chu at Houlihan.  The Creditor's Committee is fine with the transaction with the following reservations:
	1)  Escrow the proceeds
	2)  D&O insurance will be addressed in the future	
	3)  Ray needs to get back with Lilly and clarify the deal compensation arrangements for EGEP personnel including providing employment agreements to Milbank.  Lilly was confused about who was participating in the deal compensation and expressed concern about making clear that people are only getting paid once, i.e., people who got a piece of the pre-petition retention were not also getting a deal bonus for this transaction and were not also getting something out of the upcoming retention plan.
	4)  EGEP showed up on a chart that we sent her as a Debtor.  I told her that was incorrect and apologized for Eickenroht's mistake.  ( I just assumed it was Robert since he was not in the room at the time.)
	
Therefore, the Creditors are please to have us file our motion so long as it provides for escrowing the proceeds, does not provide for separate D&O insurance and does not address the deal compensation.

Bill,
I violently agree with you on this point.  My belief is that we have the op=
portunity to hire and develop the intellectual capital to be expert in the =
risk evaluation and syndication side.  If we do not, then I do not think th=
is will happen properly.  In addition to making good decisions and providin=
g good (but not always heeded advice), we need to have the extra firepower =
and credibility to 'convert the heathens'.  I think that means more and mor=
e experienced people and some more structure.  The main point of my e-mail =
was to summarize that we have already recognized the need and are addressin=
g from our end.  My last paragraph was an allusion to the fact that your co=
ncerns about the non-RAC responsibilities will become self-evident as we pu=
t a greater spotlight on this business and the teams begin to jell.  Where =
you and I may disagree is that rather than suggest that we have the situati=
on in hand and will make incremental improvements, we need to at least cons=
ider that the window is open and let's jump through.
Thoughts?
Ted

While I agree with most of your points, I would like to stress that the bus=

nternational business.  One of our biggest difficulties has been dealing wi=
th originators, logistics managers, and support staff who lack experience i=

 we will need a centralized international support staff.

Trades within high risk countries with limited information is not where we =
or the market has historically had much risk appetite.  We have continued t=
o focus the commercial teams on risk syndication and have proactively appro=
ached banks on different mechanisms for laying off risks where possible.  W=
e need to think about what risk tolerance we are comfortable with accepting=
 to help grow this business.

I agree we have had the foresight to focus on building the necessary skills=
 to support the business growth but have not done a good job of proactively=
 communicating the credit risks inherent in the international businesses.  =
Both Tom Moran and Ken Curry have decent experience in international trade =
and l/c's but have not taken a proactive enough approach with the business =
teams.  I have addressed this issue with both of them in the PRC.  I think =
John Suttle has done a good job getting up the curve on issues and has take=
n an active approach on liasing with Sydney banks and hiring the necessary =
skills sets in Australia.  As Ted noted the hiring of John Collinette has b=
een a big plus for the London team.  Although it is not their day to day re=
sponsibility, both Debbie Brackett and David Hardy have more international =
trade experience than most in the marketplace.

Effectively the International Credit Group is well structured with the cred=
it teams supporting the internatinoal businesses.  Collinette/Ngo/Suttle - =
Metals
Curry/Rohauer/Maley/Nelson/Suttle - EIM
Moran/Rohauer/Maley/Nelson/Suttle - EGM

This is a very detailed business and I think we have lacked the coordinatio=
n across offices.  We need to improve communication and continue to develop=
 the necessary depth in our teams to meet the business objectives.=20

Let's discuss in the coming weeks.
Bill

Rick,
While I am not 100% sure of what Greg means by international credit, both B=
ill and I  have recognized that there is a facet of RAC/Credit function tha=
t we are not net long vis-a-vis the direction of the business, particularly=
 the non-energy commodity businesses - steel, metals, paper - as well as th=
e coal business and the crude complex.  What seems to be needed is some peo=
ple that have experience in structures (good and bad) that support the move=
ment of large packages of physical goods from the 3rd world to the first wo=
rld.  Knowledge of the subleties of l/c language, insurance products, dog c=
ounterparties, typical scams, money launderers, lay ranges, demurrage....To=
 that end, we both interviewed and subsequently hired John Collenette, head=
 of credit for an international trading organization - Trafigura.  John spe=
nt 10 years at Paribas and then the last 7 at Trafigura.  He went through 3=
 full rounds of interviews, primarily with the metals guys and incuding Mic=
hael Brown.  My plan was to install him as the 'team lead' in metals allowi=
ng him to get 'enronized' with the idea that he would expand his role to in=
clude global products and EIM.  I guess I will accelerate this process.
In addition, I have also hired a sr spec with metals experience from Koch. =
 We have interviewed a few other prospects with transactional credit experi=
ence.  We are planning to supplement some of this industry knowledge with T=
racy Ngo and a few strong managers with solid credit skills.  The issues we=
 have yet to begin getting traction are how to staff other offices - NY and=
 Sydney principally.  Here we are constrained by current budgets.

Also, I have worked with the operations staff to take away some of the oper=
ational credit issues like chasing down information, money laundering check=
s, calling  for margin, and opening accounts so that we can hire credit pro=
fessionals to analyze credits and deals. =20

Finally, a critical piece of the puzzle is to also strengthen the people an=
d the processes around the logistics of credit - specifically, the logistic=
s function, treasury (l/c issuance/acceptance), and risk management.  It is=
 in the hand-offs of infomation where most of the risk lies, in my opinion.=
 =20

When you are here, we ought to make that a topic for discussion.  Not to ov=
er-state the need, I think it will require somewhat of an on-going focused =
effort and coordination between offices and departments similar to the EES =
style.

Everyone,
 
Paul Flack called from the courthouse at 3:40.  The Judge had taken a break, and they were to reconvene in a few minutes.  Paul said it was going well, but would likely last for some time longer.  Apparently there are around 50 lawyers in the court room.
 
I will send you an email as soon as the hearing is concluded, or, if I receive another update from the courthouse, I will pass that along as well.
 
In the meantime, please don't hesitate to call me if you need to.
 
Terri Richardson

Most of the changes proposed are clearly more than "cosmetic" and should be met with the appropriate short negative response. Especially the change to the MAC for example.
	
Ready when you all are to discuss further.

With respect to future Enron guarantees, there are at least three issues to be addressed in addition to the pervasive objective of transitioning out of the parent guarantee:

	1.  Excluding the value of major equipment from the guarantee.  I believe this is already being done for new bids.

	2.  Carving out at least part of the guarantee as within Enron's/Nepco's discretion to establish performance or other 	bonding instruments.

	3.  Negotiating transferability of the guarantee, i.e. the guarantee can be assumed by another credit-worthy entity
	with at least investment grade or, if necessary, at least a rating equal to Enron's at the time of assumption.

Since the substantive financial protection afforded by an Enron parent guarantee to the contract value would not be compromised if these are implemented, Enron's corporate position is very likely to push very hard on these points.  Logically, owners and project lenders should be willing to accept these structures--even though there undoubtedly would be strong initial pushback.  On the other hand, there may be a real question whether to accept contracts that do not provide for these relatively small steps away from the traditional hell or high water parent guarantee that Enron has approved in the past.  Discussion of these issues should be included in the DASH.  In any event, each new contract requiring an Enron guarantee will have to be approved by Rick Buy personally.

DPR                                 Cline	 The audit determined that, contrary to the agreement; excess funds were transferred to an investment account in Chris Cline's name rather than DPR.  Potentially $5.5 million was at risk to Enron.  The situation has been corrected.

Rick:  There is no legal requirement that the Board determine, approve or r=
atify the Section 16 list of officers (although in practice, we have asked =
them to do so in the past, at least on an annual basis).  Whether someone i=
s an executive officer is a question of fact, and I have not gotten any res=
ponses from others that I have attempted to get information from to determi=
ne whether or not we should update the list (the lack of response, I'm sure=
, is due to the fact that there is a lot of stuff going on).  So, I will gi=
ve you a call to discuss: (i) has your title changed? (ii) have your respon=
sibilities changed? (i.e., are you still the Chief Risk Officer?)  In the e=
nvironment of a Chapter 11 proceeding, is there any need for a chief risk o=
fficer?  (iii) are you still on the Executive Committee (is there still an =
Exec. Committee, does it still meet and what are its duties and responsibil=
ities?).  No one factor is determinative---the issues are:  do you oversee =
or set policy for an important business or administrative function of the C=
ompany?  In our former environment, the answer was easy.  I just don't know=
 the facts in today's environment.  I will give you a call to discuss.  Tha=
nks for your patience.  Rex

Wow - you are really busy if your lunch calendar is booked for the remainder of the month!  Sept. lunch sounds good.  I sure hope we make good use of the bad news about Skilling's resignation and do some house cleaning - can we write down some problem assets and unwind raptor?  I've been horribly uncomfortable about some of our accounting in the past few years and with the number of 'redeployments' up, I'm concerned some disgruntled employee will tattle.  Can you influence some sanity?

Rick, 

Lynn recently demo'd portrac for all of us in Corp Development.  It is a fantastic tool.  It's been needed for forever - I've been pulling together an asset list for Andy and Jeff Donahue - and I know first hand how difficult it is to get the detail that your group has input into portrac.  Donahue also thinks it's a great tool.  Lynn is going to demo it for Andy sometime soon.

I'm working with Lynn and Dave Gorte's folks (Cindy Hudler) to create a livelink library of models, presentations, tax structures, etc. (all the files a corp dev person needs when we actively work an asset for sale).  We hope to have a link on the portrac web page similar to the DASH and COMET links.  It's very encouraging to see how far your group has come in organizing our investment data - Cindy's got a 30GB file of all models.  It sure makes my supposed 6 - 9 month job easier!

Rick
 
I spoke with Mr. Causey this morning and moved over here. We have been
working with your IT people on security but this is a new practice for
us that we are having great success in the energy companies. As we have
worked with more companies on the finance side of businesses we have had
to eliminate the IT terms so it makes a lot more sense to Risk Managers
now.
 
e-Risk Management starts with a way to manage the risks of e-commerce
such that these risks are understood from the technologists to the board
room and you can manage it.
 
Since this is such a new and radically different concept I have found
our literature confuses more often than it helps. It has some basic
tenants that are straight forward that can be presented and understood
but are not easy to write down. It is not a product.
 
First, we are going to define risk as the potential reduction in assets
from the threats of e-commerce. Now, you have more intangible assets
than tangible assets so that we have mastered. So this discussion is on
the asset management side and is a key concept to understand. Everything
else is based on that. Often we get in an income vs. balance sheet
discussion. In your case you have $11B in book value and $27B in market
value so you have $16B in intangible assets. There are two things to do
with these assets 1) protect them as you become e-commerce enabled and
2) figure out how to leverage and grow them with e-business. So this is
where we start. 
 
On the protection side e-commerce threats will come two ways. Your
largest threats are going to be on transactions, like trading, asset
acquisition or payments. Other threats will come from vulnerabilities in
your network. So this is both in trading, business strategy and
Information technology. That is the e-Risk management side.
 
On the growth side once we and you allocate these $16B of intangible
assets to categories, strategies can be built to grow selected areas. Of
course, fixed IT assets have a high need to be leveraged also.
Approximately 25% of your IT budget is managing boxes ( fixed assets)
that has no competitive value. That is what we are doing at Chevron.
 
For protection you can throw an infinite amount of technology dollars at
the e-commerce security requirement and not eliminate the risk (if you
pin your technology people to the wall they will finally admit this).
However, once you have e-Risk Management you can manage the costs of
technology and risk to what we call "The Most Favored Case" investment.
Companies have found this e-Risk concept should be completed before a
security policy is developed because until you do understand the asset
risk you don't know what to write a security policy to do.
 
Let me know if you need more. Many energy companies, especially the
utilities, have added e-Risk to Risk Management. Many recognize e-Risk
as the biggest going forward. This is aimed at getting that elevated
Risk Management concept under way.
 
Normally we would like to come in for an introduction meeting ( 1 1/2
hours) to get the basic concepts covered and then talk about what our
e-Risk Practice does. We are at Keller Springs and the Tollway in North
Dallas if you wanted to come here.
 
Thanks.

The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on "Disaster Relief"  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of "National Prayer and Remembrance," and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/>

o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

Louise:  We are attempting to revise the Watch Report from the 7 to 8 page narrative report that has evolved to a streamlined two page analysis.  The results for EWS are attached as a draft report.  Before we make a wider distribution to other executives in EWS, I would really appreciate your comments and/or suggestions for improvement.  The Principal Investment assets have been pulled out and placed in a similar report that has been furnished to Kevin G.

Thanks for your help!      

Rick C.

Dear Cassandra Chinkin:


For Policy: Risk Management Policy, Amended October 9, 2001

Subject: Risk Management Policy Mandatory Certification

On August 14, 2001, the Board of Directors of Enron Corp. (the "Board") app=
roved a new and revised Enron Risk Management Policy (the "Policy").  The B=
oard amended the Policy on October 9, 2001.  The Policy covers Enron Corp. =
and its subsidiaries (the "Company") and focuses on procedures for managing=
 the Company's exposure to risk as encountered in the normal course of busi=
ness.  This Policy establishes a framework under which the Company's exposu=
re to risk will be evaluated, managed and controlled and pursuant to which =
capital will be allocated and preserved.  The Policy also focuses on four m=
ajor types of risk: (a) market risk; (b) credit risk; (c) operational risk =
and (d) liquidity/funding risk.  These risks will be managed on a portfolio=
 basis with standard transactions being subject to various market risk limi=
t structures and credit approval processes and non-standard transactions be=
ing subject to the Transaction Approval Process and the Guarantee Approval =
Process.   Finally, the Policy provides an overview of the various risk mea=
surement tools and limits that will be applied to risk, and the roles and r=
esponsibilities of both key participants and normal employees in the risk m=
anagement framework. =20

All managers and relevant employees of the Company are responsible for comp=
lying with the risk management policies and procedures addressed in the Pol=
icy and are required to sign a Compliance Certificate indicating their unde=

Hi Guys

The trader has confirmed that they want to copy the existing customer profiles for Bel Gas Phy ZEE HUB to the new Bel Gas Phy Option product types below.  Can you please let me know if this will be okay.

If new profiles will need to be created, let me know and I will send you a spreadsheet of the existing profiles for the physical product type so you can amend them accordingly for the option product types.

Thanks

As you are all aware, Enron and UBS have entered into an agreement for the sale of certain assets of the wholesale gas and power trading organization.  As part of that agreement, the management of UBS may speak to you over the next several days about an opportunity in that new organization.  If so, we encourage you to consider such an offer. However, if you are not employed by UBS, you remain an Enron employee.  If you have specific questions regarding your employment arrangements and job responsibilities please contact Anne Labbe in Human Resources at 5-7809, or feel free to contact either Jim Fallon or Dave Delainey directly.

Bobbi --
In the midst of the Enron bankruptcy in december, I discussed my situation ( my wife's late term pregnancy)  with my immediate supervisor Ted Murphy.  We agreed that with the uncertainty, we should return to Houston and check with Ted's Houston team for next steps.  When I returned to Houston and requested information on my work status, no one was able to inform me whether I was employed or had been laid off.  At this point, I decided to use my outstanding vacation time to find a place to live and prepare for the baby.
We are expecting the baby's arrival at any time.  Afterwards, I will take a paternity leave and discuss my options with Ted at that time.
Regards,
Rudi

Dear Colleague, 

Recent market events demonstrate how important it is for market participants to enact an effective and efficient assessment of counterparty credit risk. Over the past calendar year we have seen unprecedented deterioration of credit quality from some of the world's largest energy firms. As a result, many market participants have suffered significant credit losses, which have directly impacted their profitability and shareholder value. Moreover, it often took weeks or months for many of the affected firms to know the total amount of their exposure to these troubled energy companies. 

Over the past five years Algorithmics has been working with energy companies to solve these problems. Algo Energy <http://www.algorithmics.com/solns/algoenergy/index.shtml> enables firms to quickly analyze the risk of their portfolios and find answers to key questions. Specifically: 
  

What is the value of the transactions I have with the counterparty and what is my potential loss in case of default? 
How many affiliated entities are we trading with and what is the overall exposure? 
How are the agreements in place going to offset the transaction exposures and reduce this potential loss? 
What is the state of all posted collateral and guarantees and how does it mitigate my potential losses? 
What is my exposure to other counterparties that share similar characteristics or are exposed to the same troubled counterparty? 
How will these exposures change if market conditions change? 

Today, some companies are answering these questions proactively and allocating capital appropriately. They know the risks they are taking and they are managing their exposures to leveraged counterparties carefully. In the event of market downturn, they reduce their exposures before credit deterioration happens.  Many of these companies are able to do so as a result of Algo Energy, Algorithmics' comprehensive risk management solution for energy markets.   

Algo Energy helps a firm manage the complex interaction between market, credit, and liquidity risk. At the core of Algo Energy is a sophisticated risk engine that applies market leading valuation methodologies to all the physical and financial deals booked against a firm's counterparties, across all energy markets and using all plausible scenarios. This methodology allows a firm to establish how counterparty exposures will evolve over time and over scenarios and assess how market factors effect the credit quality of counterparties. Only through a scenario- based methodology can these interactions be computed efficiently and accurately at the enterprise level. 

Further, by applying netting agreements imbedded in complex counterparty structures, Algo Energy allows a firm to monitor and manage actual and potential exposures against counterparty limits structures, while taking into account the proper valuation of collateral and roll-off risk. Algo Energy, allows a firm to manage the various states of collateral agreements. By monitoring the agreement's threshold schedule (among other factors), the system identifies changes in obligations of the firm's counterparty due to changes in the firm's credit rating. The system in turn directs real-time states of agreements to assigned relationship managers or operation managers for active collateral management. 

Building on the award winning Mark-to-Future technology, Algo Energy helps a firm to manage their risk pro-actively. It provides transparency, flexibility and scalability at the enterprise level. This state-of-the-art technology is delivered in a distributed framework for the enterprise. Computed once, the same exposure calculations can be analyzed at either the desk level or the enterprise risk level, ensuring consistency in reporting and data quality. The distributed framework also ensures that the system is scalable and flexible to support the growing needs of the enterprise. 

Algorithmics is a world leader in enterprise risk management solutions. Headquartered in Toronto, Canada, with 15 offices and over 500 employees worldwide, Algorithmics has the largest number of dedicated risk management professionals under one roof.

Write Stuff
	
New dad David D. tells us how the Visor Edge handheld helped his wife deliver one of the first babies of the New Year.
	
  <http://www.4at2.com/email_domains/hag/0087/final/images/black_section_space.gif>	
"Baby New Year"
	
My wife Jenny and I were expecting our first child together on January 1st, 2002. For her birthday last July I gave her a Visor handheld and she has found several wonderful uses for it in her third grade classroom. For my birthday in August she in turn purchased a Visor for me.

At that time Jenny was 5 months pregnant and I was looking for programs that could help keep track of our busy lives as well as help us keep track of the pending event. I used the Memo Pad to keep tabs on things we already had and items we still needed to pack for the hospital.

I eventually found a program online called Labor Timer. It is so simple to use. All you do is push the on-screen Start or Stop button and it automatically calculates the start time of the contraction, the length of the contraction and the time between each contraction. We used it to practice so that I could work on my coaching techniques as we were planning a natural drug-free delivery.

On Christmas Day Jenny started having contractions. We used her Visor and the Labor Timer to monitor the contractions but that was not to be the day. Again on the 29th she had contractions and again no baby. However, throughout the day on New Years Eve her contractions were very consistent. That night after we rang in the New Year she felt very strongly that this might be the night. As I went to sleep Jenny used her Visor and the Labor Timer to keep track of her contractions. At 4 a.m. she said it was time to head for the hospital. Throughout the wee hours of the morning I used my Visor Edge to keep track of the contractions as we paced the halls of the hospital. The staff was impressed at how I was able to keep such accurate details as we roamed up and down the halls of Labor and Delivery. I fessed up and showed them the program running on my Visor. At 12:51 p.m. January 1st our daughter Zoe Grace was born. I am happy to report Mom, Zoe and Dad are all doing great.

Now I can use the financial calculator to plan for her college tuition and I'll need to get an eyemodule to take pictures for e-mailing and...

	What's New at ERisk.com - 09 November 2001
We've changed our home page! Now, when you type in www.erisk.com, you'll get a better idea of all of ERisk's activities. You'll find all our usual editorially independent news, community and reference resources under the 'Portal' tab.
	
Weekly
Review
In this week's round-up <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNX0Au> of economic, banking and P&C insurance news from an enterprise risk management perspective: global rate cuts boost markets, but economic news continues to be gloomy; Enron faces takeover by competitor; the strange case of the mystery credit crunch; tough times for the mortgage industry; legal action continues over World Trade Center claims. 	
Analysis 
The massive scale of claims arising from September 11 has worried many in the P&C insurance market, but harder rates should benefit those who are strong enough to take advantage of them. In this week's analysis <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNY0Av>, we look at how Lloyd's of London is struggling to convince rating agencies and insurance regulators that it is sufficiently solvent to bounce back from its World Trade Center losses and to benefit from a stronger market.

Viewpoint
Will Dynegy clinch a cut-rate acquisition of its troubled arch-rival, Enron? You can catch up on some of the background with ERisk's exclusive interviews with their chief risk officers: we spoke to Enron's Rick Buy <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0bNZ0Aw> earlier this year, while Dynegy CRO Glenn Labhart <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0Mde0AA> was the subject of our CRO Profile in August. Find out what both men had to say about risk management at their firms - and keep checking out the site for ongoing coverage of what is sure to be a major risk management story.

Feature
Bank credit processes must be up to scratch if a bank is to retain control over credit quality in its loan portfolios. In "Bank Credit Processes and Operational Risk", an exclusive new feature <http://email.eRisks.com/cgi-bin10/flo?y=hMSR0DERSw0CjE0B4W0Av> for ERisk, Becky Walzak of Boston Portfolio Advisors looks at what can go wrong, explores the increasing cost of failed deals on the secondary credit markets, and offers a solution based on ideas within the Basle II regulatory capital reform proposals.

Subject:	Operational Risk Management


As you are all aware, the latest Risk Management Policy specifically addresses Operational Risk, and more specifically commits Enron to develop systems and processes that enable Enron to better evaluate its operational risk.  To that end, I have asked Wanda Curry to lead a cross-functional team (the "Operational Risk Committee"), which will be jointly accountable for meeting this commitment. I would like to have representatives from Enron Assurance Services, RAC, Research, Information Technology, GRMO and Arthur Anderson.  

Enron's primary objective for monitoring its exposure to operational risk is to (a) identify the derivation of operational risk exposures and (b) improve the Company's systems and processes to mitigate such risk. The guidelines for operational risk assessment are essentially undeveloped.  It will be our challenge to identify, assess, categorize, quantify and mitigate exposure to operational risk.   

The risk capital allocation process includes the consideration of operational risk.  Initially, this assessment will be based on a qualitative view of the business unit's internal processes, people and systems. The initial goal, for completion prior to year-end 2001, is to establish a baseline and/or report card to convey a sense for where we are now.  It is Enron's objective, as reflected in the Risk Management Policy, to increase the sophistication of risk measurement for operational risks through documented qualitative assessments and quantitative measurements.  

A list of additional objectives to be addressed by the cross functional team has been prepared by Wanda.  These include:
	
Develop a qualitative operational risk assessment approach and implement.  This approach should enable a quick review of key functions and standards to identify weaknesses, monitor progress over time, and provide management with a representation of operational risk.
Assess and improve integrity of daily risk reports, i.e. require confirmation that all books are captured, aggregated and processed through RisktRAC, CreditAg, and Infinity applications
Ascertain the extent of spreadsheet usage across Enron and develop the ability to monitor NOP, V@R, and MTM for spreadsheets separately, i.e. a Spreadsheet DPR.  Work with GRMO to develop "rules of use" for financial valuation models and spreadsheet "books"
Utilize the existing RMS database and develop the ability to monitor intercompany - interbook activity (initially for forward positions only) and report variances 
Recommend metrics for quantitative measurement of operational risk
Access need for additional or improved risk databases

Wanda will be contacting each of you to identify your designated operational risk contact that will participate on this cross-functional team.  

Thanks,

Rick Buy

tks. we are revisiting raptor credit capacity - one of the things we told skilling was that raptor was "safe" for ENE down to $20, but this was in the absence of asset write downs within the vehicle itself - which is really the nub of the issue. dp

Our current book exposure from TNPC down to $5 is approximately $225 million (this is the credit deficiency in Raptor today).  Below $5, Enron has an additional $286 million of TNPC exposure (see attachment for components).

Would you forward to this group, on my behalf, the analysis of the remaining TNPC exposure?  Be sure and include the current exposure down to $5.  Thanks

If we have the flexibility to afford a potential significant acceleration of NewPower losses/liquidity issues ie) going to zero and we feel we have our trade credit adequately secured then the right call is probably to abandon the seats.   Mark what is your view?

We are working hard to address the immediate New Power exposure.  Dave:  FYI it might actually involve Service Co. Mark, we are talking to Jimmie this morning on that idea. We will certainly review overall exposure as a part of this.

we need to be really careful with a decision to get closer to the company, notwithstanding our fiduciary responsibility.  i do agree with either getting in or out.  we should either get more active, or abandon our board seats and get some distance.

Mark, The word on the street is that the NewPower folks are getting further in trouble (ie) strange trading activity, etc. Looks and smells a little like the old EES.

Couple of opps: 
        - get another shareholder on-side and demand an Enron led audit to confirm financial and operating health; 
        - followed up by hostile exit of mgt team if significant issues arise. 

Issues: 
        - obviously pushes us into another level of complicity/fiduciary in a blow up or bankruptcy not unlike the issues we faced with Kafus et al; however, given our continued interest a significant control issue could result in a significant acceleration of a write-off of our existing position plus any outstanding credit.

I would recommend we force the management team to submit to a detailed audit as a part of a united shareholder iniative - Lets discuss.

Rick Buy, what is our current credit position? 

Greg/John, do you have a view on this one? 

Rick Causey, we  probably need a more "permanent solution" ot the NewPower issue.

Someone from Rick Buy's Risk Management group will be calling you to schedule a visit to discuss with your team the procedures and strategy PGE has in place to manage the variability of our net variable power costs.  Since Rick's group is  a corporate Risk Management group there should be no market affiliate issues.  The visit will enable us Houstonians to get even a better handle on the risk profile of your business given the tremendous volatility we have experienced in power prices.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

In addition to the Concentration Limit NA Gas P/L notification issued below, I believe there should also be a P/L Notification on NA Gas Commodity Group Limit, but the DPR reporting does not reflect it currently.  Lavorato has a "Cross-Commodity" line on the Business Unit DPR that reflected $18,670 MM VaR and ($23,583 MM) P/L.  This does not roll up into the NA Gas Commodity Group line which had $55,509 VaR and ($67,838 MM) P/L, both below the $85 MM Commodity Group limit, but it was appropriately included in the Business Unit VaR and P/L.  

I obtained the detail of this cross-commodity line by reviewing the Concentration Limit DPR:

	VaR	P/L		
Gas	  18,580 	  (24,659)	 (a)	
Power	       233 	        376 		
Residual Fuel		        545 		
F/X		        155 		
Total		  (23,583)		
				
Business Unit DPR:				
NA Gas	  55,509 	  (67,838)		
Gas in Cross-Commodity		  (24,659)	 (a)	
Total		  (92,497)		
				


According to the Policy, all commodities traded within a business unit should have a limit approved by the CRO.  I can see how we might want to allow some leeway in the application of that requirement, but not to the extent of $18.6 MM VaR.  So my recommendation is:

1) Require the Gas and Power position in Lavorato's cross-commodity books to be rolled up into Gas and Power Commodity Group results on the Business Unit DPR, and compared to the Commodity Group VaR limits established for Gas and Power.  This would not have caused a VaR violation today as we recently increased the commodity group limit for Gas to $85 MM, only a P/L notification.  And while Power is not material now, it has been in the past, and could easily be again, and Power is a standard Americas commodity group.

2) Grant an "Other" VaR limit of $X (a small amount) that authorizes Lavorato to trade other commodities. That at least limits this other activity and will require him to discuss with the you if he wants to take an exceptionally large position in a commodity other than Gas and Power.

I think protecting the integrity of the Commodity Group limits is also important from the perspective that the Business Unit management is not really responsible for the Concentration Limit DPR (Lavorato and Kitchen do not even have access to view it!), and they are not on the distribution list for notifications on those limits. So as far as Lavorato/Kitchen is concerned, as currently reported they had no P/L notifications today as Power made some income so the business unit only lost ($97MM) vs it's $100 MM VaR limit. But the company lost ($119 MM) on gas, as noted in the e-mail below, and proper reporting of all of Lavorato's gas and power positions in comparison to his corresponding Commodity Group limits would have resulted in a Commodity Group P/L notification of ($92 MM) vs. the $85 MM limit.

We already eliminated all the position limits for Gas and Power.  Although the Concentration Limit DPR is accurately reflecting activity, we should probably make sure the VaR and P/L is being clearly reported on the Business Unit DPR as well, as that is the one that much of management of the company is still focused on.

Do you agree?   We can discuss when you're back in the office.

Regards,
Cassandra.

RICK:
 
    Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a
huminatarian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste
news is yet to come.   Here is what Ive found out...
 
    NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up
clearing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past,
the first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though
the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse
payments have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange
is likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating
the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an
effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above
(based on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some
degree of transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment
performance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing
payment delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we
may see delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical
markets.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the
terrorist attacks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been
general comments from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock
exchange payments, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would
apply to the NY commodity exchanges (but this asumption has not been
validated or addressed directly in public comments).  Hope this helps.
Brad.

Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned
about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of
NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried
that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.
In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.
As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing
falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX
payment performance?????

All,
          The Potential Exposure application and the Liquidity Risk application are now on the RAC web-site (http://rac.corp.enron.com).  The details are as follows:

(a) For Potential Exposure, Go to Credit Risk Reporting, then to Potential Exposure Simulation.

(b) For Liquidity Margin Exposure, Go to Liquidity Risk, then to Liquidity Margin Exposure.

Some additional changes have been incorporated to the version in the development stage:

(a) For Potential Exposure
Maximum Exposure amounts are currently displayed.
The first exposure is the Current Mark-to-Market.
There is flexibility in choosing a particular date.

(b) For Liquidity 
There is a breakdown of P-99 Enron Liquidity by counterparty.
Current Margins are also shown.
There is flexibility in choosing a particular date.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.  
Naveen

For the time being, Ken wants to leave the Management Committee extended meeting on the schedule for this Friday, January 11.  But, he wanted me to check your schedule for next Thursday, January 17 - probably from 8:00 to 1:00 - to see if that would work.  We are losing some people for the 11th.

I appreciate your assistance.

Rosie

MEMO TO:		ISDA North American Risk Management Contacts

FROM:			Karel Engelen
 
DATE:			January 2, 2002

RE:			Risk Management Luncheon


ISDA is pleased to announce that Edward I. Altman, Max L. Heine Professor of
Finance at the Stern School of Business, New York University, will speak at
our next Risk Management luncheon.  

In his presentation Professor Altman will present the results of a recent
study he conducted on the correlation between the Probability of Default and
Recovery Rates and the effects of this correlation on expected losses and
risk measures. He will discuss in more detail the correlation between
Recovery Rates and Probability of Default in the Merton model. The
multivariate econometric estimation model for Recovery Rates on Corporate
bond Defaults is extremely accurate in predicting 2001 Recovery Rates. The
research work has been done together with two Italian Colleagues: Andrea
Sironi and Andrea Resti.

Since 1990, Professor Altman has directed the research effort in Fixed
Income and Credit Markets at the NYU Salomon Center. He is currently the
Vice-Director of the Center. Prior to serving in his present position,
Professor Altman chaired the Stern School's MBA Program for 12 years. He has
been a visiting Professor at the Hautes Etudes Commerciales and Universite
de Paris-Dauphine in France, at the Pontificia Catolica Universidade in Rio
de Janeiro, at the Australian Graduate School of Management in Sydney and at
the Luigi Bocconi University in Milan.

Dr. Altman has an international reputation as an expert in corporate
bankruptcy, high yield bonds, distressed debt and credit risk analysis. He
was named Laureate 1984 by the Hautes Etudes Commerciales Foundation in
Paris for his accumulated works on corporate distress prediction models and
procedures for firm financial rehabilitation and awarded the Graham & Dodd
Scroll for 1985 by the Financial Analysts Federation for his work on Default
Rates on High Yield Corporate Debt. He was named "Profesor Honorario" by the
University of Buenos Aires in 1996. He is currently an advisor to the
Centrale dei Bilanci in Italy and to several foreign central banks.
Professor Altman is also the Chairman of the Academic Council of the
Turnaround Management Association. Dr. Altman was named to the Max L. Heine
endowed professorship at Stern in 1988. He was inducted into the Fixed
Income Analysts Society Hall of Fame in 2001 and elected President of the
Financial Management Association (2002). He received his MBA and Ph.D. in
Finance from the University of California, Los Angeles.

The luncheon will be held on Friday January 11, 2002 at 12:00 p.m. at the
Liffe USA Ltd. premises, 55 Broadway, Suite 2602, One Exchange Plaza, New
York.

If you would like to attend this luncheon, please notify Scott Marra at the
ISDA New York office (smarra@isda.org) by January 7, 2002. Because of
security requirements only people that reserved will be admitted to the
building.

We look forward to seeing you there.

J.C. asked me to send the following:

We are sending you by messenger today a subpoena that we received last night asking that you produce documents and appear to give testimony before the SEC. IGNORE THE DATES INDICATED IN THE SUBPOENA. We will negotiate significant and reasonable restrictions on the documents produced and different deadlines and appearance dates. These negotiations will likely result in new such dates from mid- to late-January. To the extent you have not already done so, please segregate and assemble any documents that you might have, even for the broadest request. I will be in touch with more details. 

Please do not be overly alarmed. This subpoena issued to nineteen others merely indicates that the SEC believes that you have material information relative to its investigation. It does not mean that you are a target of that investigation.

FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

Kathy,
It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)

FROM:  Enron Property & Services Corp

Bus passes for January are now available at the Parking and Transportation office on the third floor of the Enron Building, ECN 306.  These passes are offered on a monthly basis and are provided at no charge to the Enron employee.  

For employees who park in the Allen Center, Met, or Enron Center garage, new parking rates are in effect beginning with the January 31st paycheck.  Rates for 2002 have increased by $5 for unreserved and $10 for reserved spaces.  This increase is consistent with first of the year rate increase obligations in Enron's parking lease agreements with the garage operators.  Enron is continuing to subsidize employee parking for Enron lease garages.  

Direct parking costs to employees are as follows:
Enron Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Enron Center Reserved 3rd & 5th Floors	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	
Allen Center Unreserved	2001 Employee Cost - $94 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $99 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 3rd Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $215 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $225 per month	
Allen Center Reserved 4th Floor	2001 Employee Cost - $165 per month	2002 Employee Cost effective 1/31/2002 - $175 per month	


Please note that effective January 31st only the Enron Center and Allen Center Garages will be available for Enron employee parking.  To request parking or to switch to these garages please call Parking and Transportation at ext. 37060 or ext. 36399.

If you have any questions about Bus Passes or Parking, please call Martin Katz at ext. 59322.

Enron has been increasing security at its facilities around the world.  Som=
e of the changes took effect immediately (e.g. additional security personne=
l) and some are phasing in.  While not all of the changes will be visible, =
there are a few that will have an impact on everyday activities.  In all th=
e steps we take and recommendations we make, we will be making our faciliti=
es and systems more secure and endeavoring to increase your sense of securi=
ty, while doing our best to minimize disruption to our day-to-day business.

Primary responsibility for Enron Corp. Security resides in our business con=
trols organization.  You can contact this organization through their websit=
e (<http://home.enron.com/security>), by phone (713-345-2804), or by email =
(CorporateSecurity@enron.com <mailto:CorporateSecurity@enron.com>).  John B=
rindle, Senior Director, Business Controls, leads this organization.  Pleas=
e feel free to provide John and his team with your comments and questions, =
or to report security threats.

We have two areas to update you on:  changes in the access procedures for t=
he Enron Center Campus in Houston and changes to our travel advisory.

Access to the Enron Center

Over the next few days, the following access control procedures will be ins=
tituted at the Enron Center (and other facilities where practical):

?=09As employees swipe their badges at the card readers to enter the Enron =
Center, a guard will match the photo on the badge to the bearer.

?=09Employees and contractors who forget their badges must present a valid =
picture ID to obtain access to the Enron Center (U.S. driver's license, U.S=
. or foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identif=
ication).=20

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center must produce a valid photo ID when signing=
 in at the lobby reception desk and must completely fill out the visitor ca=
rd.  Adult visitors without a valid photo ID (U.S. driver's license, U.S. o=
r foreign passport, or some form of U.S. federal, state or local identifica=
tion) will not be allowed access to the Enron Center.

?=09Visitors to Enron facilities must be escorted by an Enron employee or b=
adged contractor at all times.

?=09Visitors to the Enron Center will be met in the lobby by an Enron emplo=
yee or badged contractor, signed into a visitor's log at the lobby receptio=
n area by the employee or badged contractor, and escorted to their appointm=
ent.  At the conclusion of the appointment, the visitor will be escorted to=
 the lobby by an employee or badged contractor, the visitor badge collected=
, and the visitor signed out in the log at the plaza reception area by the =
escorting employee or badged contractor.

?=09Employees are also being asked to participate in the security of their =
workplace by following these guidelines; report suspicious activity to Secu=
rity (phone 3-6300), do not open secured doors for individuals unknown to y=
ou or hold doors open, allowing "tail gating" by others.

These will be the first in a series of new security procedures to be instit=
uted at Enron.  We ask that all employees be patient during congested times=
 in the lobby.  As we proceed and obtain increased guard personnel and equi=
pment, we expect the inconvenience to decrease.  We hope you understand the=
se measures are being instituted for the security of all our employees. =09


Travel Advisory Update

With the beginning of retaliatory strikes, we have two important recommenda=
tions:

?=09While the retaliatory strikes are ongoing, corporate security recommend=
s that travel through or to the Middle East be avoided.  We continue to str=
ongly recommend that all travel during this time to Afghanistan, Yemen, Pak=
istan, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Somalia, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Geo=
rgia, and the Kyrgyz Republic be canceled.  In addition, we recommend that =
planned travel to Egypt, Israel, Gaza/West Bank, Jordan, Lebanon, Saudi Ara=
bia, Syria, and Algeria be very carefully considered.

?=09For non-U.S. citizens traveling in the United States, corporate securit=
y recommends that you carry documentation.  There have been several recent =
reports of non-U.S. citizens who reside in the United States being question=
ed and asked for documentation when boarding U.S. domestic flights. As a re=
sult, we suggest that all non-U.S. citizens who currently reside in the Uni=
ted States - and who do not have Permanent Resident Alien status - carry th=
eir passport, Form I-94 and Form I-797 at all times.  We would also suggest=
 that Permanent Resident Aliens carry their Permanent Resident (Green) Card=
 as proof of their status as a precautionary measure.  It appears that Immi=
gration Officials may be applying a section of the Immigration and National=
ity Act that requires individuals over the age of 18 to carry his/her "regi=
stration" documentation with them at all times. This can include a Permanen=
t Resident Card, Form I-94 card, Employment Authorization Card, Border Cros=
sing Card, or a Temporary Resident Card. Immigration Officials have not his=
torically been asking domestic travelers for "registration" documentation, =
but in light of the heightened security measures and current atmosphere, it=
 would be best to be prepared with all of your documentation proving your c=
urrent lawful status.

We will keep you apprised of new information and developments on the Corpor=
ate Security website and by e-mail, as appropriate.

Attached please find the corporate allocations for the 2002 fiscal year that EIM will accept.  After unsuccessfully attempting to get some justification for the PROPOSED allocations from many of the various corporate groups, we have had to make a determination ourselves as to what we believe are reasonable charges for the value received from these groups.  This determination was based on several factors including, 2001 actual allocations, expected services provided to EIM, redundant services provided by other groups that are also performed at EIM, etc.

The attached charges are acceptable to EIM and will be used in the budget presentation to the office of the chair unless the allocating groups can come to an agreement with Kent Castleman of EIM as to a revision of these charges before such meeting.

 

Jeffrey McMahon and Ray Bowen

Pls. touch base with him personally prior to the BoD meeting if you feel he will have any questions about the numbers.  Also, Rick, pls. touch base on your discussions with Pug after you make connection with him to give a heads up on if we are all on the same page. Thanks a lot.  Paula

We can not agree to even present to senior management the increase in advance rate to 50% from 30% on the utility billed AR.   The changes in the Eligible Accounts language has to do with the aggregation of the NewPower AR from it's customers, which the utility purchases.   Thus the many customer receivables are replaced by one large utility receivable.   I would appreciate legal comments with this and elsewhere.

As I had send in my e-mail message to Todd Hermanson last Saturday, and repeated again on the telephone on Wednesday, these terms have not been approved in accordance with Enron Corp's Transaction Approval Process.   Any communication should clearly state this.

Subject: Amendment to Master Credit Agreement


Lisa and Robert:

I attach a revised (new draft from NewPower) version of the Amendment and
General Security Agreement, together with a blacklined version of this
redraft against the last document we received from you.  Our changes, which
we have not had the opportunity to discuss directly with you, include the
following:  a revision of the security interest from a general lien to a
lien on all receivables and inventory only, and an increase in the October
cap from $20 to $25 million (which I understand were agreed between Cronin
and Tribolet); a revision in the definition of Eligible Accounts to reflect
receivables purchase arrangements with certain utilities (which I
understand was agreed between Hermanson and Tribolet); a proposed revision
in the advance factor for utility billed receivables from 30% to 50% (which
has not been agreed but is our proposed fix to give us comfort that the
Eligible Accounts get us up to the $25 million and $40 million limits) and
certain other changes to correct typos or to clarify certain points as to
which I believe we are in agreement.  Notably, this draft contains no
provisions that would protect NewPower against the risk of losing surety
collateral, or the risk of commodity price declines that would require the
posting of additional collateral.  As to the latter risk, my clients and
yours have been exploring swaps and other arrangements that we may employ
to mitigate that risk.

I also attach copies of proposed resolutions for the Business Review
Committee and the Board of Directors in connection with these documents.

On the assumption that these documents are acceptable, we have scheduled a
meeting of the Business Review Committee for this upcoming Tuesday
afternoon (we could not get a quorum any time today or Monday) and assuming
a positive recommendation by  the BRC, immediately thereafter we would
schedule a telephone Board Meeting for all necessary approvals, at which
point the documents could be executed and an 8-K disclosure filed.

                                              Marc E. Manly

Ted,

As far as the UK is concerned Enron has paid GBP 51,340.67 towards UK taxes for the year ending 5 April 2002.

For the UK tax year ended 5 April 2001 PWC advised us that your liability for the year was GBP 195,731.20.  Enron had paid GBP 108,746.72 during the year, and Enron paid the balance of GBP 86,984.48 in November 2001.

Regards,

Madeline

Subject:	RE: Personal Tax Liabilities

Ted, 

In addition to the $57,000 paid by Enron to the IRS, you will also have UK taxes paid by Enron to offset your US tax liability.  Most of the imputed income items relates to UK taxes ($220,000), which will be available for use as a credit against any US liability that you have.  $82,000 of the imputed items relates to housing, which also gets exluded under section 911 of the IRS code.  The housing exclusion is in addition to your usual income exclusion.  

In addition to the payments that have been made and amounts imputed, Enron still intends to tax equalize you for 2001.  

The $57,000 is the US FIT that has been paid to the IRS on your behalf.  Regarding your UK taxes, Madeline Fox is working to finalize the information for all the expats in the UK.  

Regarding PwC, they probably only meant that they are done with the tax returns for Enron's expats for this year.  We have prepaid PwC's services for the 2001 US tax year and the 2001/2002 UK tax year.  You will be contacted as usual in early 2002 regarding your tax return assistance.

Thanks,

Mike

Tim,
I have just recieved my pay stub for the period ending 11/30/01.
For the first time, it shows an incredibly disturbing number related to imputed income.
Total Earnings = $352,171
Total Earnings plus Imputed = $1,338, 394.08 
Taxes withheld = $19,895.

I do not have any clue as what this imputed income is or why it may be attributed to me.  However,  as I understand it, I am liable for the taxes to the IRS even though I received no benefit. From our last conversation, I was told that $57k was sent to IRS to settle this amount and ?86k for uK liabilities. My calculation of the liability is much higher - somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% x 1,338,395 or $535,358.  Please give me a full accounting of the taxable liabilities incurred by Enron on my behalf for the tax year 2001 for both the us and uk and the tax payments made. I would appreciate that this could be done in the next 24 hours as it is causing immense stress.  

I also spoke to PWC in the UK 2 minutes ago who told me that they were not doing any work for Enron at the moment.

Ted

Rick:

Please find attached an EIM report on our prospective counterparty(ies) on the Balli-Klockner $40m steel prepay.  We received this report from EIM after informing them that we would require a background check by Lynn's team before proceeding.  

Apparently, Enron closed a deal in the US earlier this year with WeBco which is a joint venture between Balli Group and Wierton Steel.  The commercial team is arguing that RAC and others must have investigated the allegations below at the time, but obviously felt comfortable enough to let the deal proceed.  

I believe that Ted is planning to give you a call on this to discuss.  

Regards.

Olivier

PS:  I am forwarding you another email we received from EIM on the same subject.

Dear Greg,

Attached is an update to my initial report on Balli Group and the Alaghband family.  

I have obtained a copy of the 1994 House of Representatives report referenced in the March 1999 Der Spiegel article I noted in my initial report.  This House report contains derogatory allegations about the Alaghband family and their business practices -- the relevant section is included in the attached update.  Sources note that the author of the report was known for "sensational" writing on topics difficult to verify.

I have also included excerpts of an interview with another source -- an Iranian businessman based in London who is a close personal and professional contact of the Alaghband family.  His comments are positive, barring Vahid Alaghband's alleged tendency to hold bills, and provide some additional information on the family and their  associations.  

I believe this wraps up all outstanding inquiries on this matter.  Please let me know if you have questions or areas for additional inquiry.

Best regards,

Kimberly

IS SUBSEA PROCESSING 
A VIABLE OPTION?

An SPE Gulf Coast Section 
Business & Technology Workshop




  _____  




Location: 	Wyndham Greenspoint Hotel
12400 Greenspoint Drive 
Time: 	8:00 am - 5:15 pm



Everyone is eager to take advantage of technologies that may reliably enhance profitability, and subsea processing may offer just that? But is the technology "ready for prime time"? This workshop will bring together experts from contractors, vendors and oil companies to present, debate and discuss the issues. 

Designed for operators, contractors and business people contemplating deepwater developments, this workshop is a forum to exchange ideas on both the technical and commercial issues surrounding subsea processing. 




Topics Include: 	Major oil companies believe it will work - the $100 million investment 
The Devil's advocate view of subsea processing 
The Regulator's perspective 
Multiphase pumping 
Reliability vs. Intervention, the economic trade-offs 
Ultra deepwater Solutions 
Panel Discussion 





Price: 	$325 for SPE members in advance
$415 for non-members in advance
$450 at the door

Rick,

Slide 4 is the proposed new slide.  I also added slide 3 just for your review so that you can see what is normally in the bank presentations.  They asked us to keep each part of RAC to 2-3 bullet points, at most.  Please call me at x31946.

Thanks,

Sharon

Petroleum Engineering for the Geoscientist
Instructor: Hines Austin




Date:           September 10-13, 2001 (Monday-Thursday)


Location:               SCA Training Center  Houston  8:00 a.m.  5:00 p.m.
                        2500 Tanglewilde, Suite 120A


Petroleum Engineering for the Geoscientist covers basic petroleum
engineering in laymen s terms and provides basic techniques for evaluating
reserve potential. The course introduces the geoscientist and other
non-petroleum engineering disciplines to comparative, performance and
volumetric evaluation techniques. The attendee works with and determines the
information required to elevate oil and gas volumes and performance.


The basis of the course is the emphasis on the work sessions that supplement
the lectures. Work sessions represent over 40% of the course time. This
course is a must for geoscientists involved with multidisciplinary teams.
The aim is to enable the geoscientist to recognize the contribution of data
obtained from different disciplines and to perform basic reserve
evaluations.


Who should attend?
Geologists, geophysicists, technicians, beginning petroleum engineers and
those who require a basic understanding of petroleum engineering.

All:

We have set up the following recurring meetings:

1. One hour on Thursdays with Mark Haedicke and his legal team
2. One half hour on Monday and Wednesday with Bill, Molly, Teresa, Sharon, Tracey, and Lisa.  Also Rita Bohner, Paul Darmitzel and Ed Essandoh of EES legal will attend.   This meeting will be primarily for the dealing with the high volume of small EES deals.   The aim is to define the process and drill on implementation (notices, termination, physical disconnection, proofs of claim, etc.).    Molly has made great strides here.
3. Sharon Sullo and Tracey Kozadinos are developing a standardized database for the effort.   Debbie Brackett has gotten involved on system feeds.  More to come on this.

The initial thoughts with Mark Haedicke were to parse the debtors into two or three baskets.   Smallest size would be a process.  We are grappling with whether we need a mid size and a large size process.

As not all these deals show up on the Hot Deals Report.   I have scratched out the top ten, high touch, efforts below:

1. PG&E
2. Edison
3. 360
4. NPW
5. Polaroid
6. California PX
7. Global Crossing
8. DPC LNG
9. EPIK
10. Cuiab? Turbine 11

Regards,



Michael

There should be no credit on a TVA/Cin spread.   The correlation between the 2 markets is 95% plus.

Public Relations / e-Biz called regarding the Risk Management Policy, and wanted to know if they could address it in e-Biz.  

Initially I thought no, but perhaps you might want to take this opportunity to highlight other RAC issues of interest to employees.  I was thinking - maybe the roll out of the RAC website, 3-D data visualization tool recently profiled in Risk magazine, etc?

The contact person is Jeanie Mandelker at x36305 if you'd like to discuss it further.  I told her we'd get back to her next week.

Significant New Issuance - CSFB Commentary:

?=09The emerging debt markets rallied this week as the long expected new IM=
F package for Argentina was finally announced on Tuesday. Argentina will re=
ceive US$8bn in new loans from the IMF, of which US$5bn will be allocated n=
ext month to reinforce reserves that were depleted as a result of massive s=
avings withdrawal. Another US$3bn will be extended if Argentina obtains an =
agreement to cut financing costs through a debt swap and possible buyback. =
The rally in Argentina spilled over first to the higher yielding EM assets =
(Brazil, Turkey etc), then helped other credits, although the impact was so=
fter. However, the Argentine problem is far from solved, as the Republic's =
government still has to deliver on its promises of a zero budget deficit an=
d debt restructuring, therefore the medium term outlook is still cautious. =
The Turkish market traded up after the Argentina package was announced; the=
 rally was also helped by the satisfactory T-Bills auction results and othe=
r positive news from the country. For Russian assets, the IMF announcement =
was also a long awaited boost: volumes increased significantly with prices =
climbing by more than 2 points. The Russian US$ yield curve is getting very=
 steep because most of the supply that we see is concentrated in Russia 203=
0, while the buying interest is spread across the curve. Central and Easter=
n European asset prices were on average ? point higher on the week with Pol=
and underperforming other countries after the S&P changed its outlook on fo=
reign currency rating for the Republic from "positive" to "stable". The EMB=
I+ Index tightened by 50 bps in one session on Wednesday and closed 29 bps =
tighter on the week.
?=09On Tuesday the FOMC cut the Fed Funds rate for the 7th time this year b=
y 25 bps to 3.50%, the lowest since April 1994. The accompanying Fed statem=
ent pointed at the slowing global growth and weakening business profits and=
 capital spending in the US, thus suggesting further easing is possible.
?=09As market conditions remain difficult and we are still in a traditional=
 August holiday period, primary market activity is very slow but expected t=
o soar in September with a number of deals waiting in the pipeline.

As per our discussion, the first step was to identify the participants in the retention program. The next step is to build the business case for why these employees are critical and irreplaceable to your business unit. Please provided a brief rational for why these employees were selected. Additionally, if there is a unique situation or circumstance that makes your area more vulnerable, please included in an overall business summary. For example: if your unit has a limited number of people supporting a critical area necessary to maintaining or increasing the value of the estate or the liquidation of assets, include this in your business summary. 

Demonstrate why it would be difficult to train someone else to perform a similar function. You should also comment on why the employee was recommended for the Milestone Program.  As you know this information is time sensitive, so please try and get it to me as soon as possible.  I appreciate you taking time out of your busy schedule to meet with me on such short notice.  Please call me (5x3662) if you have any questions. 

Regards,
Frank

Hi, Rick---If you don't mind, Lyn's asked that you join him at The Hyatt (am thinking the bar might just come in handy)---in front of the escalator in the lobby.  As I indicated, he's 6'3", has reddish hair, and is purported to be rather muscular.  Hope you're preparing a description for me---will call you shortly to confirm.  (He's aware that you're suitless---and the resume's not even remotely an issue.)  Talk to you soon---thx!   mb

So here's the deal:

NETCO will be 100% owned by UBS

The NETCO structure in principle is agreed but there may be some further cuts to it

Creditors committee were present at the auction which lasted all night and have, ergo, agreed the result

Dox will go to the judge this weekend and he is expected to approve by Thursday

The deal will feature an income stream going back to the estate over a number of years but clearly not via an equity ownership

Cash Recoveries take 6 to 12 months after the audit is performed.   The 2001 cash recovery is a small amount of the remainder to be collected ($475,283 claims vs $43,913 collected).  The balance will be collected in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2002. The 2000 amount ($315,579) is cash received in 2001 from audits performed in 2000.

Today, we announced our third quarter earnings results, which were right on target with analysts estimates for recurring earnings per diluted share of $0.43.  This marks a 26 percent increase over the third quarter of last year, which is due to the strong performance of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural gas pipelines.  In addition, we also announced that we are on track for our earnings target of $0.45 for the fourth quarter ($1.80 for 2001) and $2.15 for 2002.

We made a commitment to you that we would provide you with timely information about Enron's business strategy and performance, so this email is intended to provide an explanation about our earnings this quarter.

Over the past few months, we have met with analysts to discuss Enron's performance.  We received considerable feedback from investors and analysts that we needed to expand our financial reporting to include details for more of our business units.  In response to that feedback, we have provided results separately for several of our business units.  For example, while we have provided volume figures for North America and Europe, this is the first quarter we have provided financials separately for Enron Americas and for Europe and Other Commodities.  In addition, information about our global assets had previously been included in our numbers for Wholesale Services.  This quarter they are reported separately.   Finally, even though our broadband business is now part of Enron Wholesale Services, we are continuing to report that business separately.

Following are the highlights of our businesses:

Wholesale Services: Total income before interest, minority interests and taxes (IBIT) increased 28% to $754 million in the third quarter.  Total wholesale physical volumes increased 65% to 88.2 trillion British thermal units equivalent per day (Tbtue/d).
Americas: IBIT increased 31% to $701 million.  Natural gas volumes increased 6% to 26.7 Tbtu/d, and power volumes increased 77% to 290 million megawatt hours (MWh).
Europe and Other Commodity Markets: IBIT remained unchanged at $53 million as compared to last year.  While physical gas and power volumes increased, low volatility in these markets caused profitability to remain flat.

Retail Services: Enron Energy Services reported IBIT of $71 million, compared to $27 million a year ago.  So far this year, EES has completed more than 50 transactions with large customers and more than 95,000 deals with small business customers.


Transportation and Distribution:
	Natural Gas Pipelines: IBIT increased slightly to $85 million in the third quarter.
Portland General: We reported an IBIT loss of $(17) million this quarter compared to IBIT of $74 million a year ago.  This loss is due to power contracts PGE entered into at prices that were significantly higher than actual settled prices during the third quarter.  Last week, we  announced an agreement to sell PGE to Northwest Natural.  This transaction is expected to close next year.
Global Assets: This segment includes Elektro, Dabhol, TGS, Azurix and Enron Wind.  Third quarter IBIT remained unchanged at $19 million compared to last year.

Broadband Services: IBIT losses were $(80) million in the current quarter compared to a $(20) million loss last year.  This quarter's results include significantly lower investment-related income and lower operating costs.

Corporate and other: This segment includes the unallocated expenses associated with general corporate functions. This segment reported an IBIT loss of $(59) million compared to $(106) million a year ago.

In addition, this quarter we announced one-time charges of $1.01 billion.  Over the past few quarters, we have conducted a thorough  review of our businesses and have decided to take certain charges to clear away issues that have clouded the performance and earnings potential  of our core businesses.  These charges include:
?	A $287 million write-down of Azurix Corp.
?	$183 million associated with the restructuring of Broadband Services.  This includes severance costs, a loss on the sale of inventory like servers and routers, and a write-down of the value of our content services contracts due to the bankruptcy of a number of customers.
?	$544 million related to losses from certain investments, primarily Enron's interest in The New Power Company, broadband and technology investments and early termination of a structured finance arrangement.  

With our announcements this quarter we accomplished three things:  1) we showed continued strong earnings and earnings growth in our core businesses, 2) we cleared away those things that were clouding this superb performance in our core businesses, and 3) We expanded our reporting of financial results to increase transparency for our investors.

Activity on desks is dramatically scaled back.  Most of the time traders are focused on setting curves.  Mid office has the most work, booking cancellations out of commercial book into bankruptcy book. Currently it still appears as if the commercial book has more deals in it that the bankruptcy book.  Creditors with deals showing significant market-to-market gains in their favor a reluctant to book out of trades and question valuations, suggesting that going to settlement might be preferred.   Legal is deciding difference between "executable" contracts (able to negate deal) and "forward" contracts (collapse deal), with one interpretation being beneficial for EES and the other being beneficial for wholesale.   South America appears to have similar issues with Duke requesting collateral before willing to book out of transaction, suggesting high likelihood of physical settlement.

In summary, the positions being captured in value-at-risk are questionable, given slow and tedious process of cancellation/booking.  However, below is the VAR COB 12/18/01.

Ray - The Board has requested an "continual update" on a few subjects, one of which is liquidity.  This information would be sent weekly to a secure, private fax machine.  , Ken and I are also discussing a weekly phone update, which would still require a schedule similar to this one.  An alternative would be to send a weekly report that summarized only KEY CHANGES to the projected year-end cash balance and set forth a revised projected balance.  Please advise on your preference for the weeklyupdate.  

Separately, the "Meltdown Scenario" would be part of the Dec. Finance Comm. presentation, not the weekly update.

Paula - It occurred to me today that I should run this past Ray before we put it in a Board package.  This is what I sent him.  He will probably have some comments or changes but I wanted to make sure you had seen this pass as well.  Enjoy your holiday!

Paula Rieker and Rick Buy have requested several weekly liquidity slides.

1) Cash forecast - I have used the same format and updated for close of business 12/16.  I have included the supporting detail.  Do you want to stop showing the board the support?
2) Historical Cash usage - Mary Perkins tracks this.  The "Weekly Net Cash" slide in the attachment reflects weekly changes in actual cash.  This is not change in "reported" cash.  This, like Mary's daily schedule, only reflects cash in Enron Corp's three bank accounts.  We combined some groups to simplify and the table still has a lot of numbers.  We have worked with RAC to put this together and Paula is reviewing tonight to see if this answers the question she asked.  Let me know if you are ok with this.
3)  They also asked for Meltdown Scenarios.  I believe several people have looked at these scenarios.   At this point, I think all that is left is getting downgraded below investment grade.  If that happens, Marlin and Whitewing are payable.  Do you have any suggestions on what I should provide?

 << File: 011119 Board slides.xls >> 

One last item.  I mentioned to Tim that the deadline for the CFO and Treasurer reports for the regularly scheduled December Meeting is November 28.  I used to pull these together for the previous CFO and treasurer.  Let me know if you would like me to continue.

Thanks,
Greg C.

Rick/Mark:
As discussed with you yesterday, the Enron Credit book has exposure to industries which have been negatively impacted by the events of last week.

Credit spreads have widened out in most sectors that demonstrate liquidity and remain unchanged in markets that have yet to find liquidity.  The Enron Credit book is net long protection/short risk which should be beneficial to P/L in the short-term, but there is significant default risk remaining in the book.  

The exposures quoted below are gross notional exposures.  There will likely be significant recovery in the event of a default.

The primary risk is in the following sectors:

Airlines
AMR Corp/Del	- Short $10MM protection
Boeing Co. - Long $20MM protection
British Airways Plc - Short $3MM protection
Delta Airlines - Short $30MM protection
Deutsche Lufthansa AG - Long $17MM protection
Quantas Airways Ltd - Short $10MM protection
Southwest Airlines - Net flat

The positions that we are concerned about are Delta and AMR.  Continental has announced that it may miss an interest payment early next week.

Insurance/Reinsurance
Axa - Short $10MM protection; short $5mm bonds; net short $5mm protection
Conseco Inc. - Short $5MM protection; short $4mm bonds; net short $1mm protection

Additionally, we have mark-to-market counterparty credit exposure of $5.7mm to CNA, $5.8mm to Ace, 10.7mm to FSL,$3.6mm to MBIA, $10 mm to Mitsui.  Reserves have been taken for all counterparty exposure.

The biggest concern here is CNA.  

Lodging/Leisure
Carnival Corp. - short $20MM protection
Hilton Hotels Corp. - Short $25MM protection

Many of the short positions are in the insurance portfolios where we have purchased  2nd loss protection  and retain the 1st loss.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Ted

Per Rick Buy's request, we are developing procedures so that the head of each RAC department will have a current list of emergency contact numbers for all RAC employees.  I have outlined the plan below:

The Assistant in each group will be responsible for updating home telephone numbers, cellular phone numbers and home addresses for each member of their group.  Rita Hennessy will consolidate the list for all of RAC on a monthly basis.
The monthly update will be emailed to the personal email address of each department head or their designee.  This update should be stored on a personal computer until the next monthly update is received.
Two hard-copies of the monthly update will be maintained in a file at the home of Rick Carson and at the home of Sharon Sullo.

If this plan is acceptable to you, please let me know the personal email address to use.  Please call me with comments or questions.

Thanks,

Sharon

Please see attached clean.  The Compare Documents feature won't work (too big or something), but here are the substantive changes:

?	I reorganized the Executive Summary 
?	As for market risk limit violations and loss notifications, Sr. Mgmt changed so they're no longer going to Skilling for Commodity Group and Business Unit levels, although he still approves those limits.  
?	Clarified employee trading requirements
?	We heavily edited the Roles & Responsibilities section to avoid duplication (cut in half )
?	Also, scrubbed the entire body so it should be in good shape now.  

Today, Thursday, we will refine the Glossary and clear any comments from Whalley, Buy, Glisan, etc.. - we should be wrapping up by the end of the day.  Also, AA and PWC should be signing off today.

Regards,
Cassandra 
(and Scott Vonderheide)

Subject:	Associate/Analyst Program	Date:	August 22, 2001	

As most of you know, Jeff Skilling created the Associate/Analyst Program in 1990.  This Program is one of his most successful and important contributions to Enron, and will continue as a cornerstone of the Company.  It remains our single most important source of new talent.

The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a "One Enron" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.

As you may have become aware, the company received notice yesterday that you have been named as defendants (along with Enron Corp., Ken Lay, Jeff Skilling, Andy Fastow, and Arthur Andersen) in one of the federal securities class actions.  I will forward to you a copy of the Complaint.  We are in the process of determining who would be the most effective counsel for you.  If you wish to have separate representation, please let me know.  I cannot guarantee that the D&O carrier will reimburse you for the cost of separate counsel.  

I am setting up a meeting with counsel for Enron Corp., Susman & Godfrey, to discuss this litigation with you as soon as possible.  Please do not hesitate to call me with any questions.

Thank you.

Based on recent discussions with several energy firms, there appears to be
interest in conducting a survey which
*	summarizes the current state of risk management best practices
within the industry, and
*	provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based
performance for various energy related lines of business

To respond to this interest, we would like to conduct a survey which
addresses these goals. We have prepared a proposal which outlines our
approach for conducting a survey, and provides samples of expected output. I
will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you, and
determine your interest in participating.

I look forward to speaking with you, and potentially working with you as a
participant in this project.

Mike McConnell and Enron Community Relations is challenging Corp, EES, EGS (which includes ETS and Global Assets), and EWS to win the Race to Cure Diabetes.  

Which business unit  will sell the most shoes?

To participate, donate $5 to any JDRF Team Captain or contact Janice Riedel at x37507.  The donation will represent a $10 contribution (with the company match) toward the research foundation.  Your shoe will be displayed at the Big E Cafe on Friday, October 26th.  Business unit pledge totals can be viewed on the JDRF race track located in the lobby.

Approximately 35 children are diagnosed with diabetes each day.  Even with insulin, this disease results in a drastic reduction in quality of life and shortens the average life span by 15 years.  

Researchers are closing in on finding a cure.

The Cure for Juvenile Diabetes is within walking distance.

Someone from Rick Buy's Risk Management group will be calling you to schedule a visit to discuss with your team the procedures and strategy PGE has in place to manage the variability of our net variable power costs.  Since Rick's group is  a corporate Risk Management group there should be no market affiliate issues.  The visit will enable us Houstonians to get even a better handle on the risk profile of your business given the tremendous volatility we have experienced in power prices.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.

Today, the Euros are coming and John is going to be running this negotiation - here's the bad news they are not coming until 3:30pm today so we may have to work late.

Barry Tycholiz will be running this team. Barry - talk to Andy on form if you need help - you will also need to think about getting some traders available over week-end.

The Schedule outline is based on initial overview discussions/presentations  and then more detailed discussion can occur in individual groups the outline is as follows:

It may be better to split up earlier but I leave all those decisions to Andy.  

4:00		Introduction			John Lavorato & Louise Kitchen
4:45		Financial Overview		Wes Colwell
5:15		Risk Overview			Buy / Port
5:45		Credit				Bradford
6:15		Back Office			Beck/Hall	
6:45		Systems (EnronOnline)		Jay Webb	
7:15	            Mid/Back Office Systems	Jay Webb

Please make yourselves available - the meetings will take place in 2991

Tammie - please organize lunch and refreshments etc on John's card.

Thanks for your continued understanding.

Ray,

Thanks for the feedback.  We'll get started right away.  With regard to the points below:

1 - I agree.  Divestitures, like acquisitions, require DASHs. 

2 - This should not be a problem.  The only rep. that I believe we'll have to give is that we own the note free and clear of any liens.  The rep. will be given by the holder of the note, Enron Caribe, Ltd.

3 - I will have to confirm sure that the buyers are still interested on buying the note.  I will let you know as soon as I know.  I have been talking to Michael Bax, Basic Energy - they own equity interest on the plant, and Humberto Sangiovanni with Banco Popular, a local Dominican bank.  People from EGA are aware of these individuals.

 I'll keep everyone posted and will get someone from EGA to help so that they can be in the loop.

 Dan

Dan, 

Rod Hayslett has agreed to support the sale of the Haina note.  Please proceed. 

1)      I want a DASH on the transaction.  RAC signoff on any asset sales is policy.  I view the sale of a note as policy.

2)      I want to make sure that Enron is not making any substantive reps or warranties that could bite us. 
3)      I want to know who the buyer is. 

Ray
