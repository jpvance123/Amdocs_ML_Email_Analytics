Just to recap in writing....

When you are tracking faxed M-Deals, if you come across those that are not in 
Tagg or are in Tagg with an incorrect status, keep track of these numbers, 
email them to me and send the physical copy back to Laurel, not to Melissa. 
Please email these to me each day and I will email them to Laurel and 
Carolyn.  

Thanks for your help!

more reason to hesitate!!  You can get affordable ink cartridges and
refills on the internet for much lower than you pay in a retail office
supply store...just check out the folks at Mr Inkman!!

Hi everyone.  Hope you all llike this one.  It's sweet.

Love ya'll

Coco

Sally was only eight years old when she heard Mommy and Daddy talking about
her little brother, Georgi. He was very sick and they had done everything
they could afford to save his life. Only a very expensive surgery could help
him now and that was out of the financial question. She heard Daddy say it
with a whispered desperation, "Only a miracle can save him now."

Sally went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding
place in the closet. She shook all the change out on the floor and
counted it carefully. Three times. The total had to be exactly
perfect. No chance here for mistakes. Tying the coins up in a kerchief, she
slipped out of the apartment and made her way to the corner drug store.

She waited patiently for the pharmacist to give her attention but he was too
busy talking to another man to be bothered by an eight year old.Sally
twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. She cleared her throat. No
good.Finally she took a quarter from its hiding place and banged it on the
glass counter. That did it!

"And what do you want?" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.
"I'm talking to my brother."

"Well, I want to talk to you about my brother," Sally answered back in the
same annoyed tone. "He's sick ... and I want to buy a miracle." "I beg your
pardon," said the pharmacist. "My Daddy says only a miracle  can save him
now. So how much does a miracle cost?"

"We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I can't help you."

"Listen, I have the money to pay for it. Just tell me how much it
costs."

The well dressed man stooped down and asked, "What kind of a miracle does
your brother need?" "I don't know," Sally answered. A tear  started down her
cheek. "I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.
But my folks can't pay for it, so I have my money.

"How much do you have?" asked the well dressed man. "A dollar and eleven
cents," Sally answered proudly. "And it's all the money I have in the
world."

"Well, what a coincidence," smiled the man. "A dollar and eleven cents--the
exact price of a miracle to save a little brother. "He took her money in one
hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten and said "Take me to
where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents."

That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, renowned surgeon,
specializing in solving Georgi's malady. The operation was completed without
charge and it wasn't long until Georgi was home again and doing well. Mommy
and Daddy were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them
to this place. "That surgery," Mommy whispered. "It's like a miracle. I
wonder how much it would have cost?"

Sally smiled to herself. She knew exactly how much a miracle
cost...one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child.

Want to raise eyebrows on Thanksgiving Day?? Here's how.
Cut out aluminum foil in the desired shape. Wrap up the turkey

First Day of Advent--please pass on the Advent Wreath!!

Are you working on crafts or gifts for Christmas?  One of my favorite offline 
stores for craft and homemade gift supplies is JoAnn's.  And now they offer 
an online store that I can shop right from home!!  And they have a great 
promotional offer that you should definitely take advantage of...check it out 
at the link below

http://www.daily-blessings.com/cjjoann.htm

Are you looking for a gift for someone who has everything?  or at least a 
cell phone?  Did you know that cell phones give off harmful radiation?  These 
folks offer a way to make your mobile phone safer to use.  Buy one for 
yourself...and put them on your list for a gift this gift giving season!

Maybe we've seen this one before, but if we didn't and even if we did, let's 
keep ourselves reminded about this true fact and try to do something about it 
(at least pray about it).  Take care.

Daily Blessing

http://www.daily-blessings.com/cont41.htm

and don't forget to pass on the advent wreath

http://www.daily-blessings.com/advent.htm

Are you working on crafts or gifts for Christmas?  One of my favorite offline 
stores for craft and homemade gift supplies is JoAnn's.  And now they offer 
an online store that I can shop right from home!!  And they have a great 
promotional offer that you should definitely take advantage of...check it out 
at the link below

http://www.daily-blessings.com/cjjoann.htm

Are you looking for a gift for someone who has everything?  or at least a 
cell phone?  Did you know that cell phones give off harmful radiation?  These 
folks offer a way to make your mobile phone safer to use.  Buy one for 
yourself...and put them on your list for a gift this gift giving season!

=09=09An artery is a blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart. M=

arteries carry bright red, oxygen-rich blood to all parts of your body. The=

are two exceptions to this. The first is the pulmonary artery, which carrie=

Subject: Re: Bible Study - Prayer List  

Dear Carol,

I would like to put my brother Alejandro Vazquez on your prayer list.  He was 
taken into police custody Saturday night, November 18, 2000.  He was on his 
car with my dad and my son on the night of his birthday.  Police took him 
into custody, his attorney is trying this morning to stop deportation 
procedures.  He is to go to another hearing in front of Judge Atkinson on  
Wednesday morning, November 22, 2000.  My dad is taking it to hard and since 
this incident took place his high blood pressure keeps going up.  We need 
your prayers at this time for both of them.  On behalf of my brother, please 
keep him on your prayers for safety return home and to try to stop 
deportation procedures.  

God Bless,

Nelly Carpenter

Eve,

On these confirms, the counterparty is simply calculating what the premium is 
on the option.  As long as they are not crossing anything out and writing in 
the decimal amount, the confirms are okay to execute.

Thanks.
Kevin

I don't know if this is on the up and up, but its better to be aware.



>
 Please be extremely careful when you leave work and if at all
possible, do not leave alone when it gets late. A woman leaving work was
kidnapped yesterday at 6:30 from Lamar between the El Paso Bldg. and
Dynegy.  They drugged her but it appears that there was no rape.... the
police told her that about a month ago another girl downtown was also
kidnapped and raped ... so, please be careful!!!!!!!!

Please pass this on to your friends who work downtown.

	Wanna create a really distorted, scary and downright ugly face by clicking a 
few buttons? Of course you do! Then check out the FaceGenerator, a cool new 
"appliance" for your browser. The site generates faces, while you get to

Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat

As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy=20
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months,=
 a=20
project team, representing Enron=01,s temporary staffing users, have resear=
ched=20
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which sour=
ce=20
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performan=
ce=20
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project=
=20
Team members are:=20

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),=
=20
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the=
=20
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team=01,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginn=
ing=20
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group.  This g=
roup=20
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing=
=20
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online=20
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities. =
=20
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary=20
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the bes=
t=20
interests of the organization.=20

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.=
 =20
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical=
=20
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have=20
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhanceme=
nt=20
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all=
=20
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced=20
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in=20
service during this transition.=20
=20
We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,=20
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  T=
he=20
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these tw=
o=20
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we=
=20
selected CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional=
=20
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to o=
ur=20
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective=
=20

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services Group will b=

Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be=20
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed=20

What is Managed Services?

CORESTAFF=01,s Managed Services program includes:

? Equal distribution of staffing orders to all staffing partners
? Web-based application with online ordering, data capture and customized=

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

Subject:  Pancakes

Six year old Brandon decided one Saturday morning to fix his parents
pancakes. He found a big bowl and spoon, pulled a chair to the counter,
opened the cupboard, and pulled out the heavy flour canister, spilling it
on  the floor. He scooped some of the flour into the bowl with his hands,
mixed in most of a cup of milk and added some sugar, leaving a floury trail
on the floor which by now had a few tracks left by his kitten.  Brandon was
covered with flour and getting frustrated. He wanted this to be something
very good for his Mom and Dad, but it was getting very bad. He didn't  know
what to do next, whether to put it all into the oven or on the stove, (and
he didn't know how the stove worked)!

Suddenly he saw his kitten licking from the bowl of mix and  reached to
push her away, knocking the egg carton to the floor. Frantically he tried
to clean up this monumental mess but slipped on the eggs, getting his
pajamas white and sticky. And just then he saw Dad standing at the door.
Big crocodile tears welled up in Brandon's eyes. All he'd wanted to do was
something good, but he'd made a terrible mess. He was sure a scolding was
coming, maybe even a spanking.

But his father just watched him. Then, walking through the mess, he picked
up his crying son, hugged him, and loved him, getting his own pajamas white
and sticky in the process.

That's how God deals with us. We try to do something good in life, but it
turns into a mess sometimes. Our marriage gets all sticky, or we insult a
friend, or we can't stand our job, or our health goes sour. Sometimes we
just stand there in tears because we can't think of anything else to do.

That's when God picks us up and loves us and forgives us, even though some
of our mess gets all over Him. But just because we might mess up, we can't
stop trying to "make pancakes," for God or for others.

Sooner or later we'll get it right, and then they'll be glad we tried...


Please pass some of this love on to others.

Hi,  until Joe tells me otherwise, he needs to see all deals done with the 
Counterparty 'Enterprise Products Operating L.P.' if the counterparty 
signature has a stamp above it that says "By Enterprise Products GP, LLC, 
General Partner".  I will send around a copy tomorrow so that you can see an 
example of what I am talking about. 

I still do not have the list typed up from our meeting, but I will get the 
information to you as soon as I can!!

Thanks,
Brenna

Hi - 
     we have now reserved 37c1 for our covered dish on Wednesday.
However, it was not open at 11:30 - so please plan to begin taking our food 
into the conference room at Noon.    We have 37c1 from Noon until 2:00.

thanks everyone,
Sandy

Hi!  I just thought I would give an update on Stacey.  She is doing 
great!!!!!!!!  She finally got to eat solids today!  Yes, she still has her 
trachea in, but when she is capped, she can eat and talk.  And believe me, 
she is making up for lost time with both of those.  She was so happy to eat 
today.  She had some finely chopped chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, and 
macaroni and cheese.  She was elated!  It was really fun to watch her.  She 
is feeding herself but only with her left hand.  Her right arm is still 
messed up.  The bone has come loose from the socket at the shoulder and the 
muscles have stretched.   They are working on trying to get it back in 
shape.  She can move it sometimes, but is in pain almost all the time.  She 
is cussing and discussing many things.  She has decided that it is time to go 
home and gets pretty upset when she is told no (so what else is new?).  She 
will be going to the opthomologist next week - to his office.  I am so 
excited that she will actually get to go somewhere.  We will go in the 
hospital van so they can help with her wheelchair.  She is still seeing 
double in her left eye at times.  She said she was seeing two mommies today.  
I asked her if one of them was skinny.  She said "No".  I said "then both are 
fat?".  She said, "They aren't fat, they're just overweight".  She teases a 
lot and remembers most of what we ask.  Her short term memory isn't very 
good.  She has trouble remembering the nurses names but reads their name tag 
instead.  Yes, she can read some things but not everything.  Some names and 
words throw her off.  She doesn't remember the accident.  The doctor said she 
wouldn't remember the accident and probably wouldn't remember one to two 
months prior to the accident.  She is still having trouble remembering what 
month it is but can remember that it is the year 2000.  I bought her a cheap 
watch today and she is able to tell the time most of the time.  Her progress 
is wonderful and I am so excited watching her.  We don't think we'll be home 
for Christmas, but think it will be some time in January.  We are planning to 
have Christmas at the hospital.  I told her it doesn't matter where, just 
that we are together; she seem okay with that.
Well, I need to go to bed.  A chance to sleep on my own bed is a luxury.  I 
miss John beside me.  He is going to Corpus on Mon. and Wed. night when I am 
coming home.  We pass on the freeway and call each other on the phone.  One 
time we stopped at the same Exxon to get gas and necked at the gas pumps.  
I'm sure people were wondering about us.  I get to see him on the weekends, 
but I miss spending time with him and David.  Sharon is coming home on her 
days off and spending as much time with Stacey as she can.  She will be here 
over the Christmas and New Year holidays.  She is thinking about moving back 
home to be closer to Stacey but isn't sure about it yet.  
Please,  send me your phone number and address.  We can't find our address 
book and I stupidly erased everything in my mailbox last week.  My brain is 
turning into mush.
Hope to hear from you soon.  My love to all.  I miss you and love you much!
Carolyn

Dear all-

Regarding PG&G Energy Trading - Power, L.P executed Enron Confirmation 
Letters:
PG&E tends to place a stamp (disclaimer) at the bottom of Enron 
confirmations, please execute the documents if nothing else has been altered, 
and has been signed by both counterparties.  I have asked Rhonda Denton in 
our group and she said it was a disclaimer.   If nothing else has changed and 
you all have proof read the stamp to make sure the stamp has not changed; we 
do not have to see the document through the Livelink process.  You all can 
track execute and file.
Please call with any questions.
Thank you
Stephanie  x39210

Stamp reads:
PG&E Energy Trading- Power, L.P. is not the same company as Pacific Gas and 
Electric Company, the utilty.  PG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P. is not 
recognized by the California Public Utilities Commission and you do not have 
to buyPG&E Energy Trading-Power, L.P.'s products in order to continue to 
receive quality regulated services from the utilty.

(Something to that effect the copy I have Deal 455280.01 is hard to read)

I have a prayer request for you.  My dad was diagnosed yesterday with acute 
lukemia.  He is 86 years old but looks and acts more like someone in their 
late 60s or early 70s.  He is a wonderful Christian man (he's been a Baptist 
deacon for 40+ years).  Please pray that he will make the right decision on 
his treatment options and that he will not have to suffer.  Thanks.

	When the planets align properly, two hot topics collide together to form a 
parodist's dream. The folks at Brunching have come up with a winner in "Am I 
President or Not?" - a play on the latest trend to sweep Webdom, AmIHotOrNot, 
and the endless InjunctionFest that our Presidential Election has turned 
into. Perfect to play with while taking a break from work or to forward to 
your friends to remind them that we still don't know who will be running the 
country next month. www.brunching.com/cgi/amipresidentornot

	'Old' Is When...
	Your friends compliment you on your new alligator shoes and you're barefoot. 
	
	You don't care where your spouse goes, just as long as you don't have to go 
along. 
	
	You are cautioned to slow down by the doctor instead of by the police. 
	
	"Getting a little action" means, "I don't need to take any fiber today." 
	
	"Getting lucky" means you find your car in the parking lot. 
	
	You start saying things like, "Gee, this sebaceous cyst is killing me!" 
	
	Someone mistakes you for a sun-dried tomato while you're shopping at the 
grocery store. 
	
	An "all nighter" means not getting up to pee!

OUTLOOK EMAIL NOTIFICATION

Your Date of Migration is: May 24th

YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SEND E-MAIL unless you take the following action:
Please go through your Notes email and clean out as many old/un-needed emai=
l=20
items as possible BEFORE your date of migration.? After you are migrated to=
=20
Outlook you will only be allocated 100MB of total Mailbox space.?? If more=
=20
than this amount of data is migrated to Outlook YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SEN=
D=20
E-MAIL until it is below the 100MB limit.? Cleaning up your Notes email now=
=20
will prevent this from happening to YOU.

Enron=01,s messaging platform is migrating from Lotus Notes to Microsoft Ou=
tlook=20
2000 worldwide.  You will be accessing Outlook for all of your email=20
functions.=20

WHY IS ENRON MIGRATING TO OUTLOOK 2000?

Many factors contributed to the decision to migrate from Lotus Notes to=20
Microsoft Exchange/Outlook.  The most prominent factors were:

? Significant advantages to moving to a product that is more integrated wit=
h=20
current Enron apps (Windows 2000, Office and Internet Explorer)
? More efficient Shared PC and Roaming User features
? Improved support and integration for Palm/CE devices
? Instant Messaging capabilities

WHAT IS BEING MIGRATED TO OUTLOOK 2000?

? Email Messages.  From the date of your scheduled migration, the last (30)=
=20
thirty days of your Email will be converted for use in Outlook.
? All your folders in Notes you use to store email messages in.
? To Do Items
? Journal Items
? Calendar Entries dating from (1) one year in the past to (10) ten years i=
n=20
the future will be converted.
? Address Books, but NOT your Distribution Lists that you created.  You wil=
l=20
need to re-create these in Outlook.

Thank you,

Outlook 2000 Migration Team

Happy belated Thanksgiving, everyone.
 
I am sorry to have taken so long to send you this Stacey report. I was down 
in Corpus this past Tuesday and Wednesday and then up to Huntsville for 
Thanksgiving with my folks, and just returned home this afternoon (Saturday).
 
Stacey is OUT of the comma!!!!!!! She emerged from it last Sunday. Needless 
to say, Carolyn and John are just beside themselves. While I was with them on 
Wed. morning, I was able to watch Stacey in her rehab and got to see her 
write her name with her left hand. She also, just before I arrived, said 
"Momma".  Guess What? I have really seem firsthand the miracle that we have 
all been praying for. 
 
I must admit that I was somewhat teary-eyed watching this precious little 
girl do things that no one was sure that she would ever do again.  But, there 
is still a long way to go.
 
Stacey's right arm is just kind of hanging from muscle atrophy. And, it is 
giving her a lot of pain. (The good thing is that now she can tell the 
doctors where the pain is located!) Also, it is going to take several more 
months of rehab before she can go home. So, keep the prayers going.
 
As I entered the room, there was a man there who was leaving. Last December, 
he was in an accident that left him in the same shape as Stacey. But now, he 
is fully recovered. He came to the hospital because he had seen an article in 
the Corpus Christi newspaper about Stacey. He said that he felt that he just 
needed to let the family know that there really is hope and that you really 
can fully recover. WOW! Does God have a sense of timing or what?
 
Carolyn wants everyone to know how much she loves you all and appreciates 
your concern and your prayers. The hospital let them use a large room for 
Thanksgiving Day dinner. They were even going to let Stacey have some of the 
food with them. Talk about a Thanksgiving?
 
Folks, I must tell you that this has been exciting for me to see this miracle 
unfold. I have enjoyed hearing from Carolyn and being able to report these 
things to all of you. I wish that all of you could get to go and see these 
people that we have all prayed for these past few months. It has been quite 
an emotional deal for me to have seen a child that no one was sure would even 
live and now see her awake and recognizing people around her and laughing and 
crying and writing her name. Thanks for what you have done for her through 
your prayers. And thanks for allowing me to send you these updates and to be 
your eyes and ears. But, as I said earlier, we don't stop here. It's not over 
until Stacey is 100%, and she will be! I will stay in touch with Carolyn and 
keep you updated.
 
We do have much to be thankful for this year.  So, let's thank Him who is the 
giver of all the good and perfect gifts, even life itself!
 
Be Blessed!
Kent

THANKS, BEFORE & AFTER

     I never intended to tell you anything about this, but since I became
an adult I discovered that the meaning of Thanksgiving sure isn't what it
used to be.
     When I was younger, I remember receiving the inevitable homework
assignment to write an essay on "Something I Am Thankful For".  Then, I'd
spend a lot of time sitting in my room trying to figure out just what in
the world that could possibly be, and I'd end up writing down everything I
could think of from God to environmental consciousness.
     But after having children, my priorities have clearly changed.

     Before children:  I was thankful to have been born in the United
States of America -- the most powerful, free, democracy in the world.
     After children:  I am thankful for Velcro tennis shoes.  As well as
saving valuable time, now I can hear the sound of my son taking off his
shoes which gives me three extra seconds to activate the safety locks on
the backseat windows right before he hurls them out of the car and onto the
freeway.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the recycling program that will
preserve our natural resources and prevent the overflowing of landfills.
     After children:  I am thankful for swim diapers because every time my
son wanders into water in plain disposables, he ends up wearing a blimp the
size of, say, New Jersey, on his bottom.

     Before children:  I was thankful for fresh, organic vegetables.
     After children:  I am thankful for microwavable macaroni and cheese --
without which my children would be surviving on about three bites of cereal
and their own spit.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to obtain a
college education and have a higher quality of life than my ancestors.
     After children:  I am thankful to finish a complete thought without
being interrupted.

     Before children:  I was thankful for holistic medicine and natural herbs.
     After children:  I am thankful for any pediatric cough syrup
guaranteed to "cause drowsiness" in young children.

     Before children:  I was thankful for all of the teachers who had
taught, encouraged, and nurtured me throughout my formative years.
     After children:  I am thankful for all of the people at Weight
Watchers who let me strip down to pantyhose and a strategically placed
scarf before getting on the scale each week.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the opportunity to vacation in
exotic foreign countries so I could experience a different way of life in a
new culture.
     After children: I am thankful to have time to make it all the way down
the driveway to get the mail.

     Before children:  I was thankful for the Moosewood Vegetarian Cookbook.
     After children:  I am thankful for the Butterball turkey hotline.

     Before children:  I was thankful for a warm, cozy home to share with
my loved ones.
     After children:  I am thankful for the lock on the bathroom door.

     Before children:  I was thankful for material objects like custom
furniture, a nice car, and trendy clothes.
     After children:  I am thankful when the baby spits up and misses my
good shoes.

     Before children:  I was thankful for my wonderful family.
     After children:  I am thankful for my wonderful family.

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

This is from Carol Word, she is working on the Prayer List and will send it 
shortly.

Hello all.  My husband and I just returned from a trip to the Alsace region
of France over the Thanksgiving holiday and I thought I would pass on a
little something that applies to the Christmas season I learned.

Alsace lies at the It seems the tradition of decorating a tree for Christmas
began in this area (if there were no borders it would be part of the Black
Forest region of Germany).  The Alsacians are a generous, hardworking,
loving people as a whole.  Many wonderful people have come from this region.
One of the greatest is Dr. Albert Schweitzer.  Dr. Schweitzer began as a
master organist, built them actually and wrote books about them.  Then, he
felt called to the ministry and was a pastor with a compassionate heart.  He
was in Paris at a missions conference and was moved to hear of the tribes in
Africa, lost, without hope, practically no medical care and felt the Holy
Spirit move in his life once again.  He studied medicine and he, his wife
and a team of compassionate men and women moved to Gabon on the West Coast
of Africa and opened a hospital.  There, they cared for the sick in body and
spirit.

The tradition of the Christmas tree began in the early 1500's.  There was a
pastor who was coming home in the early winter evening having visited a
parishioner.  It was nearing the time of celebrating the Birth of Jesus.  As
he made his way through the dark woods, he came upon a fir tree bathed in
light.  It seemed a star sat upon the top of the tree.  The sight held such
wonder that he wanted to share it with his family.  Then, he began to see
the true story and felt that maybe it was not just coincidence that he
happened up that sight.  He cut the tree and began to dress it up in red
with white candles for his church and here is what he told the people (in my
words of course):

The tree is to remind us why Jesus came.  He came to die upon the tree for
our freedom.  The evergreen represents life even when death is all around
(all the other trees loose their leaves and "die") but only the evergreen
goes against the flow.  Its life flows from deep within.  The life of the
Christian flows from deep within.  So, the tree represents life.

The red ribbons and bow represent His Blood shed for us.  The scarlet ribbon
that covers the tree as His Blood that covers our sins.

The white candles represent (1) purity - we are cleansed and made pure
through the shed blood upon the tree, and (2) Light - that Jesus is the
Light of the World and the light on the tree is the Light on our lives.  He
said WE are the light of the world when we allow Him to live in us.

As time passed, all kinds of things have been added and the REAL purpose of
the tree has been forgotten.  One more VERY important thing that is added to
a European tree is the manger.  It is set up under the tree in the center
with a place of prominence.  Usually, the Christ Child is not added until
Christmas morning.  The tree in Europe is left in place until January when
the Three Wise Men came from the east to worship the King and this is when
gifts are usually exchanged.

While I love the giving (and the getting!) and the gathering and the eating
all the fun things that go with Christmas as much as the next person and
maybe more than some, I would like to encourage us all as we enter the
season.  If you have an artificial or real tree, a "color theme" or mix and
match, as you set the tree, remember Who died on a tree for you and your
home.  Let it represent in your home His sacrifice on the bare tree.  Let's
pray for the opportunity to witness in a different way to our unsaved
friends and family.  If you have a tree in your home this year, and you have
unsaved family, as you decorate it, each time you admire it, pray

"Father, let this tree represent You in this home.  Let Your Light shine
through me.  Let me share Your gifts You have given me with those You place
in my path.  As I wrap each present, I pray Your anointing goes with that
gift.  Let the sweater, the scarf, the article of clothes represent Your
covering over that loved one.  Let that toy bring joy to that child and open
a way for me to minister in a fresh way to that young heart.  Each time the
keyboard on that computer is touched, as I touch it, Lord, I know Your
Spirit linger there as it did for Elijah on that bed and the child was
raised.  I want Your resurrection power to flow through me to each person
You have given me to care for.  As I hang ornaments on the tree, let each
one represent a habit, a fear, a concern, a pain, a past unforgiven, a
sickness, a financial burden, a child, a husband, a wife, a future unknown
and uncertain, and the act of hanging be an act of faith of hanging it on
the cross.  An act of placing that care in Your capable Hands.  As the
lights are strung on the tree and home, let Your light shine through me.
Let my home be a beacon of Your Love in a dark, hurting, crying, sighing,
dying world.  As I meet with friends and family and reach out to hug, let my
arms be Your Arms reaching out in love.  Use me, mold me, make me what I
ought to be so I can be more like You.  In Jesus' Name...Amen!"

Just a thought I wanted to share.  We have a chance to make a real
difference in our homes as we allow Jesus to make a difference in our
hearts.

I love you all....Carol Word

Here's a laugh for today:


In an emergency session of Congress, just completed, an official change to 
the name of one of the 50 United States will take place.  As of noon today, 
November 22, 2000 the state formerly known as Florida, will officially be 
renamed "Floriduh."  Please make  note  of the change.

It's beginning to get embarrassing how many things are out there ridiculing
this now everpresent election.    But way too many of them are too funny to
keep to oneself ...........

(by "Phil")

Can we count them with our nose?
Can we count them with our toes?
Should we count them with a band?
Should we count them all by hand?
If I do not like the count,
I will simply throw them out!

I will not let this vote count stand
I do not like them, AL GORE I am!

Can we change these numbers here?
Can we change them, calm my fears?
What do you mean, Dubya has won?
This is not fair, this is not fun
Lets count them upside down this time
Lets count until the state is mine!

I will not let this VOTE count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

I'm really ticked, I'm in a snit!
You have not heard the last of it!
I'll count the ballots one by one
And hold each one up to the sun!
I'll count, recount, and count some more!
You'll grow to hate this little chore

But I will not, cannot let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, Al Gore I am!

I won't leave office, I'm stayin' here!
I've glued my desk chair to my rear!
Tipper, Hillary, and Bubba too,
all telling me that I should sue!
We find the Electoral College vile!
RECOUNT the votes until I smile!

We do not want this vote to stand!
We do not like it, AL GORE I am!

How shall we count this ballot box?
Let's count it standing in our socks!
Shall we count this one in a tree?
And who shall count it, you or me?
We cannot, cannot count enough!
We must not stop, we must be tough!

I do not want this vote to stand!
I do not like it AL GORE I am!

I've counted till my fingers bleed!
And still can't fulfill my counting need!
I'll count the tiles on the floor!
I'll count, and count, and count some more!
And I will not say that I am done!
Until the counting says I've won!

I will not let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

What's that? What? What are you trying to say?
You think the current count should stay?
You do not like my counting scheme?
It makes you tense, gives you bad dreams?
Foolish people, you're wrong you'll see!
You're only care should be for me!

I WILL NOT LET THIS VOTE COUNT STAND!
I DO NOT LIKE IT. AND AL GORE I AM!

A small boy is sent to bed by his father. Five minutes later:

"What?"

"I'm thirsty. Can you bring me a drink of water?"

"No. You had your chance. Lights out." Five minutes later:
"Da-aaaad..."

"WHAT?"

"I'm THIRSTY...Can I have a drink of water??"

"I told you NO! If you ask again I'll have to spank you!!"

Five minutes later... "Daaaa-aaaad..."

"WHAT??!!"

Judy,
We missed you all last night -- I wanted to inform you of two things:
1. Bible study is lesson 7 for Sabbath
2. Sunday there is a Baby Shower at 1:00 for Melinda -- do hope we can
have a good turnout.
Hope to see you Friday night for Youth Service.  Have a nice day.

Brenna,

For Confirms in which a Counterparty writes a decimal number next to our 
Option Premium Dollar Amount, consider these Confirms ok to Execute unless 
the Premium is crossed out and a new dollar amount is noted.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

Would you mind emailing your message to me regarding the numbers written in 
on the confirmations?  I head the voice mail that you left for Eve, and I 
would like to try to keep written documentation of these things as well.  
Just something short would be fine whenever you have a chance.

Thanks for your help Joe.

It's beginning to get embarrassing how many things are out there ridiculing
this now everpresent election.    But way too many of them are too funny to
keep to oneself ...........

(by "Phil")

Can we count them with our nose?
Can we count them with our toes?
Should we count them with a band?
Should we count them all by hand?
If I do not like the count,
I will simply throw them out!

I will not let this vote count stand
I do not like them, AL GORE I am!

Can we change these numbers here?
Can we change them, calm my fears?
What do you mean, Dubya has won?
This is not fair, this is not fun
Lets count them upside down this time
Lets count until the state is mine!

I will not let this VOTE count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

I'm really ticked, I'm in a snit!
You have not heard the last of it!
I'll count the ballots one by one
And hold each one up to the sun!
I'll count, recount, and count some more!
You'll grow to hate this little chore

But I will not, cannot let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, Al Gore I am!

I won't leave office, I'm stayin' here!
I've glued my desk chair to my rear!
Tipper, Hillary, and Bubba too,
all telling me that I should sue!
We find the Electoral College vile!
RECOUNT the votes until I smile!

We do not want this vote to stand!
We do not like it, AL GORE I am!

How shall we count this ballot box?
Let's count it standing in our socks!
Shall we count this one in a tree?
And who shall count it, you or me?
We cannot, cannot count enough!
We must not stop, we must be tough!

I do not want this vote to stand!
I do not like it AL GORE I am!

I've counted till my fingers bleed!
And still can't fulfill my counting need!
I'll count the tiles on the floor!
I'll count, and count, and count some more!
And I will not say that I am done!
Until the counting says I've won!

I will not let this vote count stand!
I do not like it, AL GORE I am!

What's that? What? What are you trying to say?
You think the current count should stay?
You do not like my counting scheme?
It makes you tense, gives you bad dreams?
Foolish people, you're wrong you'll see!
You're only care should be for me!

I WILL NOT LET THIS VOTE COUNT STAND!
I DO NOT LIKE IT. AND AL GORE I AM!

The conference room 37c1 is booked at 11:00 - and I believe Julissa plans to 
have extra tables available to set up our dishes.
 
Please see Julissa in 37c1 between 11:00 and 11:30 so she can tell us  how 
she'd like items arranged.

 In the meantime - please keep at your desk unless you need to put in a 
refrigerator on your floor.

The room is booked  (until 3pm), so we'll have plenty of time for going back 
for seconds, and for clean up.

Hope that answers most questions.   Thanks....Sandy

infancy, there's still plenty of juicy stuff here. Check out the great 
Hauntings section for some helpful cross- referencing - you can browse by 
celebrity involvement, haunted hotels, haunted houses, movie studios and 
curses. Confused by some of the terminology? Then click Glossary for a quick 
primer on terms like 'crisis apparition.' A great links section provides 
added entertainment and a horror movie review section is slowly getting off 
the ground, too. A strange topic, to be sure, but stories on James Dean's 
Porsche and Marilyn Monroe's stay at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel will make 
you want to sleep with the lights on. http://gothic.vei.net/hollywood

	One day inside the Cathedral of Pisa, Galileo Galilei watched a monk draw a 
large chandelier toward himself, light the candles and release it. In the 
chandelier's constant swinging motion Galileo saw the potential for keeping 
time. Although the first proper pendulum clock, created by Christian Huygens, 
was not constructed until after Galileo's death, it was his early theory that 
sparked the invention. For more, click here.

Fact of the Day

 


Archie Comics fans will be happy to know that a "real-life" film version of 
"Josie and the Pussycats" is in the works and is scheduled to hit theaters in 
2001. Aging Gen X'ers may remember the 1970s Hanna-Barbera "Pussycat" series, 
on which Cheryl Ladd of "Charlie's Angels" fame provided the singing voice 
for ditsy drummer Melody Valentine. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Accouting for Taste 

The accountant for the law firm of Dewey, Cheatham & Howe was retiring after 
working for the firm for seventeen years. Cheatham was interviewing 
applicants, and was disappointed, as only three had even bothered to send in 
a resume.  

After looking over the application of the first, an accountant with six years 
experience at Goldman Sachs, he called the first applicant in, and asked the 
woman what 2 plus 2 was.  

She answered, "Four."  

Cheatham said he would call her if she was selected.  

The second candidate was a CPA from Harvard, and at the end of the interview 
he was asked the same question, "What is two and two?"  

The CPA replied, "Four." Cheatham told him that he would call the young man 
if he was selected.  

The third applicant was a recently-graduated philosophy. Cheatham figured 
that this wasn't going to go anywhere, but thought, "What the hey? I've got 
nothing to lose."  

He interviewed the young man quickly and asked, "I know you don't have an 
accountancy background, but can you tell me what two plus two is?"  

To which the philosophy major replied, "Can you tell me what would you want 
it to be?"  

And was hired on the spot.

The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

=09=09The Wireless Future =20
=09=09
=09=09The wireless Internet is the big buzz these days. It's here, but it's=
 not=20
ready for prime time. Most wireless Internet services deliver an abbreviate=

It's expensive, too. Most wireless Internet devices are Net-capaable cell=
=20
phones and PDAs, though more and more laptops and palmtops are offering=20
wireless modems. Wireless is still for road warriors and others who need it=
=20
at this point, but not for long. Telephone carriers, cell companies, and IS=
Ps=20
are teaming up to make wireless Internet service cheaper and more common.=
=20
Some even foresee an entirely wireless future. You'll be able to surf the N=

n=20
get television and other multimedia entertainment over wireless devices.=20
Displays will get larger and brighter, batteries more efficient, and wirele=
ss=20
pipes fatter (can you still call it a "pipe" when it comes through the air?=
).=20
It's all going to happen, and sooner than you think.

And God said, "Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding
seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit," and God saw that it was
good.

And Satan said, "There goes the neighborhood."

And God said, "Let us make Man...

And so God created Man in his own image; male and female created
he them. And God looked upon Man and Woman and saw that they were lean
and fit.

And God populated the earth with broccoli and cauliflower and
spinach, green and yellow vegetables of all kinds, so Man and Woman
would live long and healthy lives.

And Satan said, "I know how I can get back in this game."

And Satan created McDonald's. And McDonald's brought forth the
99-cent double cheeseburger.

And Satan said to Man, "You want fries with that?"

And Man said, "Supersize them." And Man gained 5 pounds.

And God created the healthful yogurt, that woman might keep her
figure that man found so fair.

And Satan brought forth chocolate. And Woman gained 5 pounds.

And God said, "Try my crispy fresh salad."

And Satan brought forth Ben and Jerry's. And Woman gained 10
pounds.

And God said, "I have sent thee heart-healthy vegetables and olive
oil with which to cook them."

And Satan brought forth chicken-fried steak so big it needed its
own platter.

And Man gained 10 pounds and his bad cholesterol went through the
roof.

And God brought forth running shoes and Man resolved to lose those
extra pounds.

And Satan brought forth cable TV with remote control so Man would
not have to toil to change channels between ESPN and ESPN2. And Man
gained another 20 pounds.

And God said, "You're running up the score, Devil."

And God brought forth the potato, a vegetable naturally low in fat
and brimming with nutrition.

And Satan peeled off the healthful skin and sliced the starchy
center into chips and deep-fat fried them. And he created sour cream
dip also.

And Man clutched his remote control and ate the potato chips swaddled
in cholesterol.

And Satan saw and said, "It is good." And Man went into cardiac
arrest.

And God sighed and created quadruple bypass surgery.

And Satan created HMO's.

Brenna,

For Confirms in which a Counterparty writes a decimal number next to our 
Option Premium Dollar Amount, consider these Confirms ok to Execute unless 
the Premium is crossed out and a new dollar amount is noted.

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

Would you mind emailing your message to me regarding the numbers written in 
on the confirmations?  I head the voice mail that you left for Eve, and I 
would like to try to keep written documentation of these things as well.  
Just something short would be fine whenever you have a chance.

Thanks for your help Joe.

	Did you ever wonder why one's retirement savings plan is called a 401(k)? 
With the creation of the Tax Reform Act of 1978, section 401, paragraph (k) 
of the Internal Revenue Code was developed. Under this section, Congress 
authorized the creation of a tax-deferred savings plan for employees. For

You Gotta Have Faith


There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.

One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her
Bible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After
awhile, he turned to her and asked, "You don't really believe all that stuf=
f
in there do you?"

The lady replied, "Of course I do. It is the Bible."
He said, "Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?"
She replied, "Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible."
He asked, "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?"

The lady said, "Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him."
"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.
"Then you can ask him." replied the lady.

Cool Site of the Day

 


The ancient Chinese art of origami (which literally means "to fold paper") is 
remarkably documented at Joseph Wu's Origami Page. And whether you're a 
seasoned pro or have never heard the term until now, you've got to check this 
site out. For the uninitiated, there are many galleries to roam around that 
contain some of the wildest paperfolding you will surely ever see - check out 
Wu's own paper microscope for proof. You will also find the history of the 
art, links to origami sites across the entire Web, instructions on how to 
learn the art, supply information, and plenty of diagrams on how to perfect 
some of the more popular folds. Old pros will find a community thriving here 
that will support even the most wild paper-folders out there. Get to it!

HOLIDAY SAFETY REMINDER

The holiday season can mean an increased risk of fires and a higher potenti=
al=20
for criminal activity due to people taking advantage of convenient downtown=
=20
shopping and because of the increased number of special events and office=
=20
parties.  We would like to pass along a few safety and security tips from t=
he=20
City of Houston Fire Department and the Houston Police Department.

? Please do not prop open stairwell doors or doors to the freight elevators=
. =20
This defeats security.=20

? Use only artificial trees and greenery in decorating your office space. D=
o=20
not place cut trees or greenery within the building. Cut trees become major=
=20
fire hazards when they dry out.

? Office parties or the holiday mood may distract you.  Be alert for thieve=
s=20
who try to take advantage of the holiday season. Sometimes just having fewe=
r=20
people at work during the holidays creates an opening for thieves. If you s=
ee=20
someone that does not appear to belong in your work area, immediately call=
=20
the Enron Security Console at 713-853-5360.

? Keep your purse or wallet with you at all times or locked away in a drawe=
r=20
or closet.

? If you go shopping, invite a friend to go along. Try not to overload=20
yourself with packages.  When you return, lock your gifts away in a safe=20
place.

? Always be aware of your surroundings while in a public area. If things do=
n=01,
t look right, follow your instincts and avoid going into the area.

? When waiting for a ride home after hours, remain inside the building near=
 a=20
card-reader door until you see your ride arrive.=20

? If office parties are on company premises and involve alcoholic beverages=
=20
or public invitees, call security at 713-853-5360.  Security will advise yo=
u=20
as to company guidelines.

Subject: Prayer Requests from Wednesday November 8


Here are the prayer requests from Wednesday and I have added several emailed
prayer requests forwarded to me this week.  There are so many hurting
people.  It is great to know the Great Physician, isn't it?!!!

Sorry so late.  I pray that you will remember this one thing:

"I am your refuge and your strength.  Even though the earth gives way and
the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, do not fear.  I am an ever
present help in trouble."
Psalm 46:1-3

InfoBeat Alerts - An Update from InfoBeat


*** An Update From InfoBeat

Dear Valued InfoBeat Subscriber:

We sincerely apologize for any service disruption or inconvenience
you may have experienced recently with your InfoBeat service.
Over the past few months, we have been making important upgrades
to many parts of our publishing system.  Unfortunately, the final
set of upgrades, which we have been working on over the past few
weeks, has caused some unanticipated disruptions to the InfoBeat 
service.

The InfoBeat engineering team worked around the clock this past
Thanksgiving weekend to implement changes that will prevent such 
situations from occurring in the future.  We very much appreciate 
your continued patience as we make some final enhancements which, 
when completed, will result in an InfoBeat service that is better 
than ever.

Thank you for your continued support which has helped InfoBeat grow 
to be a service with over 8 million subscribers, each receiving 
personalized news every day.  We greatly appreciate your patience 
as we finish our upgrades that will make InfoBeat even better for 
every one of you.  

If you have any questions or comments, please visit our Feedback 
page at www.infobeat.com, or email us at feedback@infobeat.com.

Sincerely,


Mark Wachen
CEO, Indimi/General Manager, InfoBeat

It is my great pleasure to announce that the Board has accepted my=20

ve=20
at the time of their next board meeting on February 12, 2001.  Jeff will al=

e=20
as chairman of the Board and will remain at Enron, working with Jeff on the=
=20
strategic direction of the company and our day-to-day global operations.

Jeff will assume the role at a time when the company is hitting on all=20
cylinders and is positioned for phenomenal growth.  He is clearly ready for=

the job, and after 15 years as CEO of this great company, I=01,m ready for =
a=20
somewhat different role.

Our succession plan has been clear for some time.  This has afforded Jeff a=
nd=20
me the freedom to combine our strengths toward building a company that=20
continues to exceed everyone=01,s expectations, including our own.  We look=
=20
forward to furthering that relationship as Jeff expands his role.

There are no plans for any other changes in our management team nor broad=
=20
shifts in strategy and direction.

Please join me in congratulating Jeff.  I look forward to a great 2001.

Subject: Could it be we're not paying attention?



The man whispered, "God speak to me" and a meadowlark sang. But the man
did not hear. 

So the man yelled "God speak to me" And the thunder rolled across the sky.
But the man did not listen. 

The man looked around and said, "God let me see you." And a star shined
brightly, but the man did not notice. 

And the man shouted, "God show me a miracle" And a life was born.  But
the man did not know. 

So the man cried out in despair, "Touch me God, and let me know you are
here" Whereupon, God reached down and touched the man. But the man brushed
the butterfly away and walked on. 

Don't miss out on a blessing because it isn't packaged the way that you
expect.  So many times we see miracles and do not recognize them for what
they are. 

My instructions were to send this to four or more people that I wanted God
to bless and I picked you. Please pass this to people you want to be
blessed.

Any weather deals that you see that have WS and then a two-digit number need 
to be sent back to have our number written on them.  They should be returned 
to Celeste Cisneros.  I am not sure where she is located, but if you happen 
to find any of these, just ask and whoever does the run will make sure they 
go to the proper location.

Thank you!

Prayer Wheel

Let's see the devil stop this one! Here's what the
wheel is all about. When you receive this, say a
prayer for the person that sent it to you....That's
all you have to do....There is nothing attached....
This is so powerful....Just send this to seven people
and watch God's answer to prayer work in your life. Do
not stop the wheel, please.... Of all the free gifts
we may receive, Prayer is the very best one..... There
are no costs, but wonderful rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another.
Amen.

A Prayer

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now. I am asking You to minister to their spirit
at this very moment.

Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy.

Where there is self doubting, release a renewed
confidence in Your ability to work through them.

Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to
give them understanding, patience, and strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.

Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to
renew them by revealing Your nearness, and by drawing
them into greater intimacy with You.

Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to
them Your courage. Where there is a sin blocking them,reveal it, and
break
its hold over my friend's life.

Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and
raise up leaders, and friends to support, and
encourage them. Give each of them discernment to
recognize the evil forces around them, and reveal to
them the power they have in You to defeat it.

I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In love, Your Friend

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something Christ would do.

Let's see the devil stop this one! Here's what the
wheel is all about. When you receive this, say a
prayer for the person that sent it to you....That's
all you have to do....There is nothing attached....
This is so powerful....Just send this to seven people
and watch God's answer to prayer work in your life. Do
not stop the wheel, please.... Of all the free gifts
we may receive, Prayer is the very best one..... There
are no costs, but wonderful rewards.... Let's continue
praying for one another.
Amen.

A Prayer

Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
right now. I am asking You to minister to their spirit
at this very moment.

Where there is pain, give them Your peace and mercy.

Where there is self doubting, release a renewed
confidence in Your ability to work through them.

Where there is tiredness, or exhaustion, I ask You to
give them understanding, patience, and strength as
they learn submission to Your leading.

Where there is spiritual stagnation, I ask You to
renew them by revealing Your nearness, and by drawing
them into greater intimacy with You.

Where there is fear, reveal Your love, and release to
them Your courage. Where there is a sin blocking them,reveal it, and
break
its hold over my friend's life.

Bless their finances, give them greater vision, and
raise up leaders, and friends to support, and
encourage them. Give each of them discernment to
recognize the evil forces around them, and reveal to
them the power they have in You to defeat it.

I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.

In love, Your Friend

Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will bless you both.
Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
something Christ would do.

I don't see what the confusion is all about

We now live in a country where I have no President but I do have ...

1) a dead Senator from Missouri going to Congress.
2) a fake President played on TV by Martin Sheen.
3) a new Senator from New York who used to be the wife of the boss
of the man who may be President.
4) a Governor from Florida who is the brother of the man who may be
President and son of a man who was.
5) a sitting President whose wife now will be hanging around the same
men who voted to remove him from office.
6) a senior Senator from South Carolina who, under our current
Constitution rules, could be appointed to be President in this standoff
despite the fact that he is 98.
7) a potential Vice President who, because he did not take his name
off the Connecticut Senate race, could end up being the deciding
factor in how the Senate is composed.

And finally ....
8) A state where a Republican Secretary of State and a Democratic
Attorney General try to determine the outcome of 25 electoral votes
without appearing to be partisan.

Any questions? Frankly, I don't see what the confusion is all about!

	Many believe the potato chip was born in 1853 in a restaurant in Saratoga 
Springs, N.Y. when a picky customer complained about the thickness of his 
fried potatoes. When the potatoes were returned to wise guy cook, George Crum 
he sliced some potatoes as thinly as possible, fried them and sent them back 
to the customer. To his surprise the man loved them. For more, click here.

	Jennifer visited a psychic of some local repute. 
	
	In a dark and hazy room, peering into a crystal ball, the mystic delivered 
grave news: 
	
	"There's no easy way to say this, so I'll just be blunt - prepare yourself to 
be a widow. Your husband will die a violent and horrible death this year." 
	
	Visibly shaken, Jennifer stared at the woman's lined face, then at the single 
flickering candle, then down at her hands. She took a few deep breaths to 
compose herself. 
	
	She simply had to know. She met the fortune teller's gaze, steadied her 
voice, and asked: 
	
	"Will I be acquitted?"

When you see Gas Deals that are between two parties other than Enron, throw 
them away.  Joe has said that we do not need to call them to let them know, 
just toss them.

The SITARA system was brought down Monday night (12/4/00) for 4 hours for  
required maintenance.

This additional maintenance time as well as the normal nightly processing may 
delay the availability
of some portfolios early Tuesday morning. 

 The expected time for completion of priming portfolios for Tuesday is 
between 6:30 and 7:00 AM.

CPR will be available during this time.

Please call the SITARA/CPR Hotline ((713)-853-7049) if you have any questions 
or concerns.

Subject: Toby & Cindy - new baby

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.
Kristy


Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian 
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know 
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly

Subject: Friends needing prayer

Dear Friends - Molly is a dear friend of mine and I know she and her
friends would appreciate your prayers. Pray for God's will in this
situation and His glory. Also for comfort and strength for Toby and Cindy.
Thanks for taking the time to do this. Kristy

MOLLY - I'LL BE PRAYING! KRISTY

From: "Molly Herb" <rmbl20@hotmail.com>

Good Morning:

I need each of you to be in prayer about some friends of ours.  Some of
you already know the situation, but they have asked that we pass the word
along.

They want everyone to be in prayer.

Toby and Cindy are expecting a baby and Cindy will be going in Tuesday
(11/28) to have the baby - c-section.  The baby has Anencephaly which
means, the way I understand it, the baby will be born with only a brainstem 
and no skull bone.  There are other malformations with this - possibly cleft
lip/palate, abnormalities of the hands and/or feet and other internal
malfunctions.  They have know this for quite a while and she has carried
the baby almost full term.  I think her actual due date is 12/10.  The baby
will die.  The way I understand it all babies born with this usually are
stillborn or die within hours or a few days after they are born.

To be truthful, I really don't know what to pray for.  I'm just praying
for comfort and peace for Toby and Cindy and the Lord's Will would be done.
I cannot even imagine what they are going through and we all have so much
to be thankful for.

Toby and Cindy just ask that everyone please be in prayer for them and
specifically pray on Tuesday, the 28th.  She goes to the dr. at 11:30.

There are some websites you can go to for more information.
www.asfhelp.com is a support foundation and there are numerous other websites 
under keyword "anencephaly".

Thanks for the prayers guys.  I know Toby and Cindy will feel them and
appreciate them.

Love all of you - Molly

Subject: Your Friend

Darlene,
I have a friend in my Sunday School class who is the Josten's distributor 
here in Dallas. This is the company that makes class rings. He will sell me a 
class ring at cost! (How 'bout that?) So, if you will get the info from your 
friend about her daughter (ring size, school, name, etc) I will get her a 
ring. I don't know that I can afford gold, but I can silver, if that is ok. 
If we want gold, we could maybe pool some money. The cost of a gold ring is 
$175 vs $75 for silver. Anyway, just let me know as soon as you can so that I 
can get it ordered. I'm not sure on the delivery time, but we do need to get 
moving on it so that she can enjoy it before the school year is over.
 
Blessings!
Kent

Subject: Re: Good News!-PRAISE REPORT  

I have a praise report to share.  
 I was touched as was everyone else who read the prayer request for Kat.   I 
delivered my donation to Darlene by hand  because she is on the floor below 
me.  I believe the Lord gave me an amount to give and I was obedient (my mind 
was saying you shouldn't!  You will need this money yourself!)   I believe 
because I was obedient the Lord has blessed me.   Luke 6:38 " Give and it 
shall be given good measure , pressed down, shaken together and running over 
shall men give unto your bosom.  For with the same measure you mete it shall 
be measured again unto you."    I believe that the new testament church 
operated the way we Christians are supposed to.    Helping each other and 
manifesting the love of God.
To make a long story kinda short.   The Lord use a seemingly awful situation 
to  work out for good.  My son missed his airplane back to school.  We spent 
the whole day Sunday in the airport on standby trying to get a flight on 
overbooked airplanes.   He ended up having to wait for a flight this Monday 
to get back to school on time.  It was urgent that he be back before 3:00 
today.   I paid additional money to book him on a flight that had an 
available seat leaving a t 10:00 am this morning. The flight  would arrive 
too late but was the only thing we could obtain.     One of the agents was 
led of the Lord, I believe,  to help us and told us to get to the airport at 
5: 00 this morning and get  on the stand-by list for the 6:00am  flight which 
was also overbooked,  and maybe my son had a chance of getting on.   We did 
as she said and sure enough he was able to get on board and get to his 
destination at 12:45 today. (My son said to me "Mom lets pray that I will be 
able to get on this flight" as we passed through security to get to the 
boarding gate).     Praise the LORD!   The gate person gave him a real ticket 
for a real seat when he gave his name at the gate.  The story does not end 
there.   Another flight person taking the luggage remembered us from the 
previous day , found that we had been bumped the day before even though my 
son had been number 1 in line to get a seat on the next flight out .  This 
woman gave us back the money I had to pay for rescheduling the flight , PLUS 
A FREE ROUND TRIP TICKET TO ANYWHERE WE WANT TO GO! 
 PRESSED DOWN SHAKEN TOGETHER AND RUNNING OVER!!!!   IT IS TRULY MORE BLESSED 
TO GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE.  We can't out give God!  
Blessings,
Juanita

Hello sunshine.  How are things ?  I must say the Lord has really been 
blessing me and my family.  Tell all the prayer warriors I said Thank you.  
There's no way Thank you is enough. I cannot believe the out pour of help 
that came my way.  My load has been lifted considerably, I have a smile on my 
face.  Our God is an awesome God.  He reign's from Heaven about with power 
and love, our God is an awesome God.  I have gotten so many card and letters 
it is unbelievable.  I am so overwhelmed by all of this I can't help but to 
cry.  When people don't even know you they come to your rescue. The Lord is 
going to Bless each and every one of them richly.  Tell all of them I said I 
love them with love of the Lord.  If there is anything I can ever do please, 
please call on me.  The Lord is going to Bless me to be in a position one 
day, I can help someone it is just a matter of time.  And for you Darlene - I 
Love You.  You have always showed concern for me and my family, even when you 
were having problems yourself.  I just Love You!!! May the Lord continue to 
Bless you and your family abundantly. Can I send an e-mail to the saints, the 
one I have their name?  Let me know.  Keep me on your prayer list I will be 
going to the doctor, that always makes me a wreck.  Also, have you heard 
anything about lil Michael?  I want to know how he is doing, I am so sure the 
Lord pulled him though. Please let me know.  I will write again tomorrow, my 
son just walked in I do not want my kids to know my situation, they do not 
need stress, especially him.   I Love you all.

Be Blessed in Jesus Name.
Kat

Hi,  I am trying to get an accurate number of the volume that we are faxing 
each day.  If each of you will email to me the total number of liquids and 
the total number of mdeals that you fax each day I will be able to keep a 
running total.
 
Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!

I must admit, yesterday I was basically told, but not in these exact words, 
how ungrateful I  was.

You see, I am one of those very fortunate people who, until a few years ago, 
had perfect 20/20 vision.
As we who are over 40 very well know, you start to lose your "good eyes" and 
must resort to eye glasses or contacts.  Well, after several years of 
fighting with the glasses, losing them, sitting on them, etc., etc., I opted 
last year for a contact lense (i.e. one -- Mono Vision).  It has been trying 
as you have to get used to focusing with one eye for reading and the other 
for distance.  

I had a conversation with my eye doctor yesterday, wanting a miracle cure, 
you know, 20/20 vision in the form of, I don't know!!, a simple pair of 
contacts?  Or, Was I a candidate for surgery?  He said that we (former 
20/20's) were the worst when it came to contacts as we had the most difficult 
time accepting our perfect vision loss.  

Immediately, I was humbled....  "Okay, okay, I hear you, I understand."  
At least I CAN see with corrective lenses, so what if it is not perfect.  

As you read below, I really am much more blessed than the many, many, many 
people of the world...

I will never complain again (well... not for a few days anyway).  

Bless and be Blessed!!!

Just a note to let you know how much and how often we think of you.  Hope 
you are having a terrific day!!
Annette

A Thanksgiving Thought:

The following is something to ponder:

If you have food in the refrigerator,
clothes on your back, a roof
overhead and a place to sleep ... you
are richer than 75% of this world.

If you have money in the bank, 
in your wallet, and spare change in a
dish someplace ... you
are among the top 8% of the world's wealthy.

If you woke up this morning with more health
than illness ... you are more blessed than
the million who will not survive this week.

If you have never experienced the danger of
battle, the loneliness of imprisonment, the
agony of torture, or the pangs of starvation...
you are ahead of 500 million people in the world.

If you can attend a church meeting without fear
of harassment, arrest, torture, or death ... you
are more blessed than three billion people in the
world.

If your parents are still alive and still married ...
you are very rare, even  in the United States.

If you hold up your head with a smile
on your face and are truly thankful ... 
you are blessed because the majority can, 
but most do not.

If you can hold someone's hand, 
hug them or even touch them on the
shoulder ... you are blessed
because you can offer healing touch.

If you can read this message, 
you just received a double blessing in
that someone was thinking of you, and furthermore,
you are more blessed than over two billion people
in the world that cannot read at all.

Have a good day, count your blessings, and pass
this along to remind everyone else how blessed we
all are.

Those days off are fine.  See if you can get the calendar and put your days 
on it.  I know that sounds backwards since you could have done it before, but 
this way we can all get into the habit of emailing, getting a response and 
then putting it on the calendar.  

Sorry for the confusion.

Cool Site of the Day

 


Adam Sandler's new movie, "Little Nicky," hits theaters this weekend and it 
turns out it's a 19th Century British period piece. Just kidding. To get the 
skinny on the flick, head over to its devil-themed Web site. Download screen 
savers and desktop wallpaper, watch the trailer, play Devil's Hangman and 
read up on the cast, crew and storyline. Nice looking and lots of fun, this 
site would make Little Nicky very proud. www.littlenicky.com

Fact of the Day

 


In 1921, an unknown World War I American soldier was buried in Arlington 
National Cemetery while similar ceremonies were also held in England and 
France. These memorial services all took place on Nov. 11 to commemorate the 
anniversary of the end of World War I (Nov. 11, 1918). This day of 
remembrance became known as Armistice Day and on June 1, 1954, the name was 
changed to Veterans Day to honor all U.S. veterans. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

 


*** Starbuckaroo  

The gal was in a coffee shop, surveying the establishment's menu. After 15 
minutes, the counter guy got impatient.  

"How about this?" he asked, jabbing his finger at the menu item, "latte."  

"Nooo," said the blond slowly, "I need to have it early."

should be, because sooner or later, if you are posing, you will forget the 
pose, and then where are you?" - Fanny Brice, actress and singer (1891-1951).

>From Carol Word

Attached are the prayer requests for Wednesday, November 15.  Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:

Carol,

Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is "No, los dejes caer ententacion", interpreted as
"No, Let us not fall into temptation."  Or it can be "No, lead us not
into temptation."  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.

Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer.
---------------------
Here is what I feel explains it as well:

When Jesus commanded us to pray "Lead us not into temptation" He was
instructing believers to pray that forces beyond their own control would not
lead them into trials (see Matt 24:20, Revelation 3:10).  ;He is also
commanding believers to watch and pray against entering into temptation
through their own carelessness or disobedience (Matt 26:41, Luke 21:34; Luke
22:40, 46).

Jesus had warned Peter;  "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat" (Luke 22:31).  Knowing Satan's plans,
Jesus cautioned Peter to watch and pray lest he enter into temptation.  This
indicates that if Pete would have listened to Jesus, he would have remained
strong.

Jesus also knows our potential weaknesses.  He remembers we are dust (Ps
103:14).  He knows our human spirits may be willing, but our flesh is weak.
He realizes that we can give in to temptation as a result of our own
carelessness and disobedience, and Jesus knows of forces can circumstances
beyond our control that can come to try us.  Therefore, He lovingly commands
us to pray "Lead us not into temptation".

Jesus will not lead us there.  When we pray for His leadership, He leads us
away from it.  According to Strong's it is asking Him to make us strong and
be our guide.

There is more to it than only that which we can get into, and should most
definitely, later.

Have a safe, blessed Holiday and know I will be praying for all of you.  See
you next on Wednesday, November 29th when Juan Barba's wonderful Godly
mother will minister to us from a mother's heart.

God Bless you...Carol

In case you all don't already have this, Pete gave me the rotating pager 
number for his group.  Hopefully this will enable us to get in contact with 
someone on a weekend if the need arises.

713-515-1826.

I would only use this number on the weekends as we SHOULD be able to contact 
someone during the week.

Thanks!

Brenna

	"Proof of Life" opens around the country Friday and it had better be good 
because if it's not, it will only live in infamy as "That Movie Where, During 
Filming, Meg Ryan Cheated On Dennis Quaid With Russell Crowe" - and nobody 
wants that. The film's official Web site is cool stuff, highlighting all the 
things about kidnapping and ransom you never thought you'd need to know. It's 
actually a little harrowing, with statistics in red typeface flying across 
the screen like CNN coverage during wartime. Click on individual countries to 
learn about their "K&R" history, and then swing over to the typical goodies 
like trailer, soundtrack info, cast & crew, etc. Good-looking site for a 
movie starring a good-looking couple - just don't think about that part, 
though. www.proofoflife.com

together in love. They have 2 children.

Merci

Mark emailed me the current Time Tracking sheet that you all are using.  I 
have revised it to include spaces for numbers of each type of commodity that 
you track.  This way, rather than estimating numbers of different commodities 
tracked each week, we can get true numbers for Carolyn each month.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
Brenna

Hi Juan

Per my previous e:mail below we have now assigned you your second requested 
intern (per Kevin Presto's earlier request to John Lavorato).    These Inters 
were on Kevin  Presto's actual selection of candidates for his world.   Their 
names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

Joseph Spector    Start date:   June 4th
Andrew Kandolha  Start date:  May 21st

The A&A Program will be in contact with your assistant to set up appropriate 
systems etc.

The girl's name is Charmaine Holmes.  She is in the 4th grade and enjoys 
playing ball with her friends.  She hopes to be an actress when she grows 
up.  Her favorite story's to read are those by Beverly Cleary.

The boy's name is Alex Reymundo.  He is also in the 4th grade and likes to 
play football with his friends.  He hopes to be a police officer when he 
grows up.  His favorite series to read is Goosebumps.

Anyone who would like to participate in donating funds, please have your 
contributions to me by November 30th.  The estimated cost per child is 
$200.00.  Each individual who donates will be eligible for the drawing for 
the famous "Enron Kids" T-shirt.  

If you would like to volunteer to go shopping, gift wrap the gifts or take 
the gifts to the school, please see me by November 30th.

Thank you!

=09=09The Onion =20
=09=09
=09=09Quick! What's the funniest site on the Web? If you said The Onion, "A=
merica's=20
Finest News Source," consider your sense of humor validated. This online=20
newspaper is the best social satire going -- no small feat in this=20
postmodern, post-satire age. Ostensibly another news site, The Onion offers=
 a=20
twisted view of current events and the typical fodder of local newspapers.=
=20
The current issue has election news -- "Vote, Voter Wasted" -- and human=20
interest -- "Neighborhood Children Gear Up for Hotly Anticipated 'Opening o=
f=20
the Gerbil's Tomb.'" The site uses friends and relations of the editors for=
=20
pictures. Good sports because usually they're posing as the incredible dwee=
bs=20
and losers populating the typical Onion news story. Be warned -- The Onion =
is=20
too funny to resist. You'll be mailing stories to friends and wasting the=
=20
boss's time if you're not careful. By the way, the Onion bills itself as "n=
ot=20
intended for readers under 18 years of age." I might ! recommend that the=
=20
easily offended or politically rigid avoid it, for the sake of cardiovascul=
ar=20
health.

Are you working on crafts or gifts for Christmas?  One of my favorite offline 
stores for craft and homemade gift supplies is JoAnn's.  And now they offer 
an online store that I can shop right from home!!  And they have a great 
promotional offer that you should definitely take advantage of...check it out 
at the link below

http://www.daily-blessings.com/cjjoann.htm

Are you looking for a gift for someone who has everything?  or at least a 
cell phone?  Did you know that cell phones give off harmful radiation?  These 
folks offer a way to make your mobile phone safer to use.  Buy one for 
yourself...and put them on your list for a gift this gift giving season!

Cool Site of the Day

 


The New York Review of Books may be a bit too pretentious for some, but it's 
more than worth plodding through for its literary value. The magazine's got a 
long list of contributors who've all made a huge mark on the world of letters 
- Norman Mailer, Saul Bellow and Truman Capote, to name a few. Another 
highlight is the caricatures gallery by the journal's artist, David Levine. 
And finally, for those looking to avoid online booksellers' "book 
suggestions" that are just thinly-veiled advertisements, you'll find a 
plethora of genuine recommendations here. Read on. www.nybooks.com

Fact of the Day

 


Poppycock comes from the Dutch pappekak, and it describes something that is 
nonsense or whose value is equivalent to its original meaning: soft dung. For

Joke of the Day

 Out of the Mouths of Babes


A first grade teacher collected well known proverbs. She gave each
child in her class the first half of a proverb and asked them to come 
up with the remainder of the proverb. Their insight may surprise you.

Better to be safe than....................Punch a 5th grader

It's always darkest before............... Daylight Savings

You can lead a horse to water but.........how?

Don't bite the hand that................. looks dirty

If you lie down with dogs, you'll.........stink in the morning

Happy the bride who.......................gets all the presents

Don't put off till tomorrow what..........you put on to go to bed

Children should be seen and not...........spanked or grounded

You get out of something what you.........see pictured on the box

And the favorite...

Better late than..........................pregnant

Enron and its subsidiaries are required to comply with Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy which requires an employee to conduct himself/herself in a=20
manner which is not detrimental to the best interests of Enron and which do=

not bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct=20
consequence of his/her employment with Enron.  Further, Enron's Business=20
Ethics Policy states that no lavish entertainment or gifts are to be given =
or=20
received by Enron employees for special position, price, or privilege.

 Not only is it incumbent upon our employees to follow this policy, but you=

Outage:  eol net change
Environments Impacted:  EOl
Purpose: 
We have found that IP multicast storms on the EOL internal subnet 172.16.21.0 
briefly incapacitate the EOL firewall eolfw1.  To solve the problem, we will 
insert a new VLAN/subnet 172.16.23.0 between 172.16.21.0 and the firewall so 
that no IP multicast traffic will reach the firewall interface.  Physical 
work includes running two copper cables from trd-cx[12]-3405 port 6/7 to 
eolfw1 and logical work entails defining the new VLAN on the 
switches/routers, enabling interface vlan23 and changing

ip route 192.216.56.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4
ip route 192.216.57.0 255.255.255.0 172.16.21.4

	Once you've visited PatSajak.com, you can say you've seen everything. That's 
right - the riveting Wheel of Fortune host finally has his own site. We've 
all been waiting, sweating, biting our collective lip for this day to come 
and now it has arrived. So, you ask, what is the first thing I'm greeted with 
when I arrive? A Flash animation of Pat's smilin' mug. Click it once and 
you're in the middle of the challenging PatPuzzle, wherein you can rearrange 
the man's face (in the nice way). Then read Pat's newsletter which is 
chock-full of late-breaking headline news, a section dedicated to Pat's talk 
show (which is suspect, considering it lasted roughly 4 minutes on the air), 
find out how to make your big break by becoming a Wheel contestant, and learn 
about Pat's many many side projects. The web at its most compelling.

Hello all

Some of Enron Confirmation Letters are able to fit on one page, example: Duke 
Energy Marketing and Trading LLC are often able to fit on one page (not all 
the time).  In the past Duke one page Confirmation Letters we coming over 
with a number 1 on the bottom, but both signatures (Enron and Counterparty) 
were included.  We have taken the page number out of the template and 
hopefully all is corrected.  If you see an Enron Confirmation Letter with 
both signatures included although it might have a Page 1 on the bottom, and 
no other changes, it is okay to Execute the Confirmation Letter.  If you have 
any questions, please let me know!

Thanks 
Stephanie

Your order is here.    Your total is $43.56.  I am training someone today so 
look for me in my blue sweater and ponytail.  I should be somewhere in the

Just to give you an update.  Avon ran short on these since they were so 
popular.  I am suppose to get it the week before Christmas.  If it comes

Thanks,
Marlo

Cool Site of the Day

 


Mr. Winkle is a real dog who lives in Los Angeles. And like everybody else in 
that city, he's really cute but something's a little off. Check Winkle out 
for yourself at his Web site and see if you agree. The exact breed of this 
phenomenal dog is unknown and the owner is obviously enjoying making money 
off of the fact - calendars, posters and "short films" have been created 
around him and are for sale at the site (naturally). Hear Mr. Winkle pant and 
bark as you roam around, and make sure to get a good, long look - you're not 
likely to see another dog like this ever again. www.mrwinkle.com

	Some of the best Websites are created by The People Who Have Too Much Free 
Time - and if someone recreating over 180 scenes from the Star Wars Trilogy 
entirely out of Lego blocks isn't a sign of someone who's got too much free 
time, then I don't know what is. That's right, a scary individual who most 
likely lives in a basement somewhere has spent a jaw-dropping 2,600 hours 
recreating Star Wars in Lego format and has put it all on a Web site for the 
geek in all of us to check out. Warped and strange? Probably. Creative and 
interesting? Definitely. http://www5b.biglobe.ne.jp/~mbsf

	Chai is the word for tea in many parts of the world. India's take on chai is 
gaining popularity in the U.S. and has found a home on the menu at Starbucks 
and other coffee houses. It is a spiced milk tea containing rich black tea, 
heavy milk, a combination of various spices and a sweetener. The spices used 
can vary but are usually cardamom, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and pepper. For

	Phone Phun
	There was this phone company that was going hire one of two teams of 
telephone pole installers and it was up to the boss to choose. 
	
	So the boss said to both teams, "Here's what we'll do. Each team will be 
installing poles out on the new road. The team that installs the most poles 
gets the job." Both teams headed right out. At end of shift, one team came 
back and the boss asked them how many they had installed and they said  
they'd put 12 in. Forty-five minutes later, the other team came back in and 
they were dragging. The boss said, "Well, how many poles did you guys 
install?" The team leader wiped his brow and sighed, "We got three in." 
	
	The boss gasped, "Three? Those other guys put 12 in!" 
	
	"Yeah," said the leader, "But you should see how much they left sticking 
out!"

Subject: Fwd: Can You Believe It?

Conveniently Forgotten Facts??
Back in 1969 a group of Black Panthers decided that a fellow Black Panther
named Alex Rackley needed to die. Rackley was suspected of disloyalty.
Rackley was first tied to a chair. Once safely immobilized his friends
tortured
him for hours by, among other things,pouring boiling water on him. When they

got
tired of torturing Rackley, Black Panther member Warren Kimbo took Rackley
outside and put a bullet in his head.  Rackley's body was later found
floating in a river about 25 miles north of New Haven, Conn.




Perhaps at this point you're curious as to what happened to these Black
Panthers. In 1977, that's only eight years later, only one of the killers
was
still in jail. The shooter, Warren Kimbro, managed to get a scholarship to
Harvard. He later became an assistant dean at Eastern Connecticut State
College.
Isn't that something? As a '60s radical you can pump a bullet into someone's

head, and a few years later, in the same state, you can become an assistant
college dean! Only in America!




Erica Huggins was the lady who served the Panthers by boiling the water for
Mr. Rackley's torture. Some years later Ms. Huggins was elected to a
California
School Board.




How in the world do you think these killers got off so easy?  Maybe it
was in some part due to the efforts of two people who came to the defense of

the
Panthers.  These two people actually went so far as to shut down Yale
University with demonstrations in defense of the accused Black Panthers
during
their trial.




One of these people was none other than Bill Lan Lee. Mr. Lee, or Mr. Lan
Lee, as the case may be, isn't a college dean. He isn't a member of a
California
School Board. He is now head of the US Justice Department's Civil Rights
Division.




O.K., so who was the other Panther defender?  Is this other notable
Panther defender now a school board member? Is this other Panther apologist
now
an assistant college dean? No, neither!  The other Panther defender was,
like Lee, a radical law student
at Yale University at the time. She is now
known as The "smartest woman in the world."  She is none other than the
Democratic candidate for the US Senate from
the State of New York----our
lovely First Lady, the incredible Hillary Rodham Clinton.




And now, as Paul Harvey says, you know (the rest of the story).

Pass
this on! She deserves the press................

60 Seconds for God

Take 60 seconds & give this a shot! Let's just see if Satan stops this one.

All you do is -

1) Simply say a small prayer for the person who sent you this, (Father God, 
bless this person in whatever it is that You know he or she may be needing 
this day!)

2)Then send it on to five other people.

Within hours five people have prayed for you, and you caused a multitude of 
people to pray to God for other people. Then sit back and watch the power of 
God work in your life for doing the thing that you know He loves.

Please send it back to me, so that I can also pray for you!!!

> Ice Cream for the Soul
>  author unknown
>
> Last week I took my children to a restaurant. My six-year-old son asked if
> he  could say grace.  As we bowed our heads he said, "God is good. God  is
> great.  Thank you for the food, and I would even thank you more if Mom
> gets us ice  cream for dessert. And Liberty and justice for all! Amen!"
>
> Along with the laughter from the other customers nearby, I heard a woman
> remark, "That's what's wrong with this country. Kids today don't even know
> how to pray. Asking God for ice-cream!  Why, I never!"
>
> Hearing this, my son burst into tears and asked me, "Did I do it wrong? Is
> God mad at me?"
>
> As I held him and assured him that he had done a terrific job and God was
> certainly not mad at him, an elderly gentleman approached the table.  He
> winked at my son and said, "I happen to know that God thought that was a
> great prayer."
>
> "Really?" my son asked.
>
> "Cross my heart."  Then in theatrical whisper, he added (indicating the
> woman whose remark had started this whole thing), "Too bad  she never asks
> God for ice cream.  A little ice cream is good for the soul sometimes."
>
> Naturally, I bought my kid's ice cream at the end of the meal. My son
> stared  at it for a moment and then did something I will remember the rest
> of my  life.  He picked up his sundae and, without a word, walked over and
> placed it  in front of the woman.  With a big smile he told her,  "Here,
> this is for you.  Ice cream is good for the soul sometimes and my soul is
> good already."
>
> The End
>
> I loved the story, and I hope you like it too.
>
> Please keep it moving.
>
> God Bless.

>  The 26-year-old mother stared down at her son who was
>  dying of terminal leukemia. Although her heart was
>  filled with sadness, she also had a strong feeling of
>  determination. Like any parent she wanted her son to
>  grow up and fulfill all his dreams. Now that was no
>  longer possible. The leukemia would see to that. But
>  she still wanted her son's dreams to come true. She
>  took her son's hand and asked, "Billy, did you ever
>  think about what you wanted to be once you grew up?
>  Did you ever dream and wish what you would do with
>  your life?" "Mommy, I always wanted to be a fireman
>  when I grew up." Mom smiled back and said, "Let's see
>  if we can make your wish come true".
>
>  Later in Phoenix, Arizona, where she met Fireman Bob,
>  who had a heart as big as Phoenix. She explained her
>  son's final wish and asked if it might be possible to
>  her six-year-old son a ride around the block on a fire
>  engine. Fireman Bob said, "Look, we can do better than
>  that. If you'll have your son ready at seven o'clock
>  Wednesday morning, we'll make him an honorary fireman
>  for the whole day. He can come down to the fire station,
>  eat with us, go out on all the fire calls, the whole
>  nine yards! "And if you'll give us his sizes, we'll
>  get a real fire uniform for him, with a real fire hat
>  - not a toy one - with the emblem of the Phoenix Fire
>  Department on it, a yellow slicker like we wear and
>  rubber boots. They're all manufactured right here in
>  Phoenix, so we can get them fast."
>
>  Three days later Fireman Bob picked up Billy, dressed
>  him in his fire uniform and escorted him from his
>  hospital bed to the waiting hook and ladder truck.
>  Billy got to sit on the back of the truck and help
>  steer it back to the fire station. He was in heaven.
>  There were three fire calls in Phoenix that day and
>  Billy got to go out on all three calls. He rode in
>  the different fire engines, the paramedic's van and
>  even the fire chief's car. He was also video taped
>  for the local news program. Having his dream come
>  true, with all the love and attention that was
>  lavished upon him, so deeply touched Billy that he
>  lived three months longer than any doctor thought
>  possible.
>
>  One night all of his vital signs began to drop
>  dramatically and the head nurse, who believed in the
>  hospice concept that no one should die alone, began
>  to call the family members to the hospital. Then she
>  remembered the day Billy had spent as a fireman,
>  so she called the fire chief and asked if it would
>  be possible to send a fireman in uniform to the
>  hospital to be with Billy as he made his transition.
>  The chief replied, "We can do better than that.
>  We'll be there in five minutes. Will you please do
>  me a favor? When you hear the sirens screaming and
>  see the lights flashing, will you announce over the
>  PA system that there is not a fire?" It's just the
>  fire department coming to see one of it's finest
>  members one more time. And will you open the window
>  to his room?......Thanks."
>
>  About five minutes later a hook and ladder truck
>  arrived at the hospital, extended its ladder up to
>  Billy's third floor open window and 16 firefighters
>  climbed up the ladder into Billy's room. With his
>  mother's permission, they hugged him and held him
>  and told him how much they loved him. With his
>  dying breath, Billy looked up at the fire chief and
>  said, "Chief, am I really a fireman now?" "Billy,
>  you are," the chief said. And Billy closed his eyes
>  one last time.
>

Kim attached is the general job function and plan for the staff requested 
below.  This plan has been reviewed with the majority of the staff on the 
email above.

The end result will vary but generally this plan will allow the floor to 
create a pool of staff that will ensure the trading floor is well supported 
on the trading, scheduling, hourly and services areas from the core of our 
fundamentals group.  By using the spring and fall - of cycle staff we will 
also be able to better manage the core summer analyst rotations.

I'm looking forward to the orientation and training of this new talent and 
Thanks for you assistance in this matter.

Please ensure that the eight staff that we require in August come from the 
list the Kevin Presto has issued you.

M Deal #333292 A&B was sent to the file room to be faxed to the counterparty. 
After being faxed we are to track as sent to counterparty. This deal is not 
in the Tagg system. I  called and informed Ana Rizvi on this matter this 
morning. I checked Tagg again and this deal has not been entered at this 
time.

In October of this year, we asked you to participate in the =01&Pulse=018 s=

Over 70% of you were willing to take the time to respond.  Thank you!  This=

=20
our work is not over and these will continue to be areas of attention.=20

 As a follow-up to the recent Enron Corp. memorandum forming Enron Wholesale 
Services (EWS), effective today, we have reorganized the Wholesale Services 
Legal Department.

 The goals in reorganizing the department are as follows:  (i) align the 
legal department as closely as possible with the business units, (ii) speed 
the flow of legal technology across the business units, and (iii) achieve 
greater efficiency and consistency across the organization.

 To this end, a legal policy group will be formed for EWS Legal, which will 
include Lance Schuler, Enron Americas; Mark Evans, Enron Europe; Mark Taylor, 
Enron Net Works; Alan Aronowitz, Enron Global Markets; Julia Murray, Enron 
Industrial Markets; and Bruce Lundstrom, Enron Global Assets.

 The organization chart for the EWS Legal Department is attached.  More 
comprehensive organization charts will follow for each group.

Mark Frevert and Mark Haedicke

>WHY JESUS IS BETTER THAN SANTA CLAUS??
>
>Santa lives at the North Pole - JESUS is everywhere.
>
>Santa rides in a sleigh - JESUS rides on the wind and walks on the
>water.
>
>Santa comes but once a year - JESUS is our ever-present help.
>
>Santa fills your stockings with goodies - JESUS supplies all your needs.
>
>Santa comes down your chimney uninvited - JESUS stands at your door and
>knocks, and then enters your heart when invited.
>
>You have to wait in line to see Santa - JESUS is as close as the mention
>of His name.
>
>Santa lets you sit on his lap - JESUS lets you rest in His arms.
>
>Santa doesn't know your name, all he can say is  "Hi little boy or girl,
>what's your name?" - JESUS knew our name even before we were born.  Not
>only does He know our name, He knows our address too. He knows our
>history and future.  He even knows how many hairs are on our heads.
>
>Santa has a belly like a bowl full of jelly - JESUS has a heart full of
>love
>
>All Santa can offer is "HO HO HO" ... - JESUS offers health, help and
>"hope."
>
>Santa says, "You better not cry" - JESUS says "Cast all your cares on me
>for I care for you."
>
>Santa's little helpers make toys - JESUS makes new life, mends wounded
>hearts, repairs broken homes and builds mansions.
>
>Santa may make you chuckle, but JESUS gives you joy that is your
>strength.
>
>While Santa puts gifts under your tree ... - JESUS became our gift and
>He died on a tree.. The cross!
>
>We need to put Christ back in CHRISTmas, Jesus is still
>the reason for the season.
>
>For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that
>whosoever believeth in Him should
>not perish, but have everlasting life.
>John 3:16
>
>May I be the first to wish you A Blessed Holiday Season!

	Remember the Magic 8 Ball from your youth? Well, in keeping with the 
tradition of the rest of our lives being digitized in Web-chunks, you can now 
have a Magic 8 Ball shaken just for you on the Web. That's right - ask it a 
question and the 8 Ball shakes itself up and reflects an answer to you via a 
Webcam. The use of the Webcam and a bunch of other techno-babble is explained 
in excrutiating detail at the site but will make your head explode if you try 
and read it. Trust me - just stick to the questions. 8ball.federated.com

	At The Coma
	The woman's husband had been slipping in and out of a coma for several 
months, yet she had stayed by his bedside every single day. One day, when he 
came to, he motioned for her to come nearer. 
	
	As she sat by him, he whispered, eyes full of tears, "You know what? You have 
been with me all through the bad times. When I got fired, you were there to 
support me. When my business failed, you were there. When I got shot, you 
were by my side. When we lost the house, you stayed right here. When my 
health started failing, you were still by my side. You know what?"

Hello sunshine.  I haven't heard from you, I trust everything is okay.  I 
have sad news to report.  My neighbor died this morning. You remember the 
little neighbor who got burned, and no one told her that her father had lung 
cancer, well he expired.  Please pray for the family.  I feel so sorry for 
his wife.  I know I never have good news, and if you ever get tired of me 
telling you bad news just let me know.  The devil is so busy, I have to ask 
for help to fight him.  I really appreciate your willing ear. My other 
neighbor went to the emergency room Monday and they will keep her until 
today. She 
thought she was having a heart attack.  We do not know what is wrong with her 
she will go for test on next Thursday.  Help me pray for these families.  You 
know I love you.  I will talk to you later.  Tell all the Saints I said 
hello. 

Be Blessed in Jesus Name 
Kat

Cool Site of the Day

 


The absolute height of European cool is the Vespa motor scooter. And those 
who love them REALLY love them - check out Vespa.org and see for yourself. 
How to fix 'em up, serial numbers of old models, tips for long road trips, 
lots and lots of pictures, even a list of international Vespa events. These 
people take their motor-scooterin' quite seriously and their is site is fun 
to cruise around - even if you don't own one. www.vespa.org

Fact of the Day

 


Long before one's box of Cap'n Crunch or Rice Krispies came with a plastic 
tchotchke, Kellogg's Corn Flakes ran the first breakfast cereal premium 
offer. In 1909, the Funny Jungleland Moving Pictures Booklet was available 
with the purchase of two packages of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. The offer ran for 
23 years. For more, click here.

FW:? A SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY!
?
You know you are at a SERIOUS MEXICAN BIRTHDAY  PARTY IF:
?
1.??? Some of the guests didn't  bring a gift, but brought extra uninvited 
kids.
2.??? When the cake says "Happy  Birthday Mijo" instead of the child's real 
name.
3.??? The party is at Chuck E.  Cheese, but they brought their own food, 
cake, and a pinata.
4.??? It's a party, but there are  more grown-ups than children.
5.??? It's "Mijo's" 1st Birthday and  the party food is carne asada, arroz 
con frijoles puercos, y 10 cases of  beer.
6.??? For entertainment, instead of  playing pin the tail on the donkey, 
there is usually a televised baseball,  football game, or a live fight.
7.??? They don't sing Happy  Birthday, instead everyone is salsa dancing.
8.??? The party was over at 5:00,  it's 10:00 and the party is just starting.
9.??? You find out from Abuela that  Abuelo is taking viagra.
10.??? The host calls someone who's  on their way and tells them to stop and 
get some tortillas and ice.
11.??? The guests start arriving and  the hostess disappears to get ready.
12.??? You hear someone go up to the  birthday child and say "Mira, tan cute!"
13.??? Someone else says? "I'm  going to have to get you something next week 
when I get paid.
14.??? The party is Saturday, and  you get a call from the hostess Friday 
night saying, "I'm giving Mijo a birthday  party tomorrow at 3:00."
15.??? Some guests bring gifts that  are still in the store bag unwrapped.
16.??? There always seems to be more  family than friends at the party.
17.??? You have the party over at  your's brother's because he bought a new 
house and he has a pool.
18.??? The cake didn't come from the  store; it came from the mother of the 
comadre of your friend's sister who makes  really good cakes.
19.??? You are told you have to save  your plate and fork you ate your food 
with, so you can eat you  cake.
20.??? Someone calls and says they  can't make it, but asks that you save 
them some cake.
21.??? Guests are wrapping up cake  to take to Madre, Tio, Abuela, Chata y el 
Junior.
22.??? The party music is coming  from a small boom box.
23.??? The birthday child is dressed  from head to toe in Tommy.
24.??? The birthday baby's Daddy  comes to the party and brings the kid he 
had before and after the Birthday  Baby.
25.??? It's "Mijo's" party, but  since his cousin Madonna is there and her 
birthday is in a few days, it becomes  Mijo's and Madonna's party.
?
Power to la Raza
?
I thought this was?something to share with all  you REAL Mexicans and those 
who are still trying to get to know  us..........

Hi Juan

Per my previous e:mail below we have now assigned you your second requested 
intern (per Kevin Presto's earlier request to John Lavorato).    These Inters 
were on Kevin  Presto's actual selection of candidates for his world.   Their 
names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

Joseph Spector    Start date:   June 4th
Andrew Kandolha  Start date:  May 21st

The A&A Program will be in contact with your assistant to set up appropriate 
systems etc.

I have recently learned that using the IPTV viewer and downloading music from 
the internet can possibly interfere with other applications that you may be 
working in.  Please do not use IPTV viewer or download music from your PC 
while at work.  

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks!

Hi,
Here's the latest on the Lincoln twins.  We need to buy the magazine he
talks about at the bottom -- dad talked to him this week on the telephone.

As Enron finalizes plans for our child care center scheduled to open during 
the 3rd quarter of next year, we would like your input on 3-5 alternatives 
for names for our center. We will be holding open forum type focus groups on:

December 11th and 12th in room EB49C3 from 11 am to 1 pm.


If your schedule allows, we would love to have you stop by and provide your 
feedback.  

Thanks for your assistance in naming our center! We look forward to seeing 
you next week!

Regards,

Charla

--- Original Message -------

=7F
Every once in a while a really good message gets circulated--this is one of
them!

A little boy is telling his Grandma how's everything is going wrong.
--------------------

School,
family problems, severe health problems, etc.

Meanwhile, Grandma is baking a cake.
She asks her grandson if he would like a snack, which of course he does.
"Here, have some cooking oil."

"Yuck" says the boy.

"How about a couple raw eggs? "

"Gross, Grandma!"

"Would you like some flour then? Or maybe baking soda?"

"Grandma, those are all yucky!"

To which Grandma replies: "Yes, all those things seem bad all by themselves=
.
But when they are put together in the right way, they make a wonderfully
delicious cake! God works the same way. Many times we wonder why he would
let
us
go through such bad and difficult times.

But God knows that when He puts these things all in His order, they always
work for good!

We just have to trust Him and, eventually, they will all make something
wonderful!"  God is Crazy About You. If God had a refrigerator, your pictur=
e
would be on it.

If He had a wallet, your photo would be in it. He sends you flowers every
spring and a sunrise every morning.

Whenever you want to talk, He'll listen. He can live anywhere in the
universe, and He chose your heart.

Face it, He's crazy about you.

Just to give you an update.  Avon ran short on these since they were so 
popular.  I am suppose to get it the week before Christmas.  If it comes

The Flu Vaccine may come in and be available in the next couple of week.
Since Enron let us know in October to not rely on Enron alone for 
vaccinations, most of you may have already have shots.

But, if you plan to be vaccinated at Enron, they are taking requests by 
e-mail, and will contact those of the waiting list when the vaccine is 
here.   You would sign up using Health_Center.com.

For any other questions, call Health Center at x3-6100.

thanks,
Sandy

  Some cute bumper stickers!

  Some people are only alive because
  it is illegal to shoot them

  I used to have a handle on life, but it broke.

  WANTED: Meaningful overnight relationship.

  You're just jealous because the voices
  only talk to ME.

  BEER: It's not just for breakfast anymore.

  So you're a feminist...Isn't that cute.

  I need someone real bad...
  Are you real bad?

  BEAUTY is in the eye of the beer holder.

  All men are idiots...
  and I married their king.

  The more you complain,
  the longer God makes you live.

  I(nternal) R(evenue) S(ervice):
  We've got what it takes
  to take what you've got.

  Hard work has a future payoff.
  Laziness pays off now.

  Reality is a crutch for people
  who can't handle drugs.

  Out of my mind...Back in five minutes.

  As long as there are tests,
  there will be prayer in public schools.

  Hang up and drive.

  I said "NO" to drugs,
  but they didn't listen.

  Your kid may be an Honor Student,
  but YOU'RE still an idiot.

  Smile, it's the second best thing you can do with your lips.

  I took an IQ test and the results were negative.

  Where there's a will...I want to be in it.

  It's lonely at the top, but you eat better.

  Don't drink and drive...
  You might hit a bump and spill your drink.

  Consciousness: That annoying time between naps.

  Ever stop to think, and forget to start again?

  Always remember you're unique...
  Just like everyone else.

  HONK
  If You Want To See My Finger

  Who lit the fuse on your tampon?

  I don't have a license to kill.
  I have a learner's permit.

  I wasn't born a bitch.
  Men like you made me this way.

  Keep honking while I reload.

  Taxation WITH representation isn't so hot, either!

  Who were the testers for
  Preparations A through G?

  Madness takes its toll.
  Please have exact change.

  5 days a week my body is a temple.
    The other two, it's an amusement park.

  EARTH FIRST!
  We'll stripmine the other planets later.

  If you drink, don't park.
  Accidents cause people.

  If you can read this
  I can hit my brakes and sue you.

  Save the whales!
  Trade them for valuable prizes.

  Whitewater is over
  when the First Lady sings.

  Jack Kevorkian for White House physician.

  My wife keeps complaining I never listen to her
  ...or something like that.

  Sure you can trust the government!
  Just ask an Indian!

  Alcohol and calculus don't mix.
  Never drink and derive.

  If we are what we eat,
  I'm cheap, fast, and easy.

  Stop repeat offenders.
  Don't re-elect them!

names as per the attached spreadsheet:   I believe you will have Andrews 
resume as earlier sent, and I will forward you Joseph's today.

> In November, I lost my sister to a rare kind of breast cancer.  She

> antibiotics for infections. After 2 rounds and it continued to get worse,

> A biopsy found a fast growing malignancy. Chemo was started in order to

> Paget's Disease
> This is a rare form of breast cancer, and is on the outside of the breast,
> on the nipple and aureola. It appeared as a rash, which later became a
> lesion with a crusty outer edge. I would not have ever suspected it to be
> breast cancer but it was. My nipple never seemed any different to me,
> butthe rash bothered me, so I went to the doctor for that. Sometimes, it
> itched and was sore, but other than that it didn't bother me. It was just
> ugly and a nuisance, and could not be cleared up with all the creams
> prescribed by my doctor and dermatologist for the dermatitis on my eyes
> just prior to this outbreak. They seemed a little concerned but did not
> warn me it could be cancerous. Now I suspect there are not many women out
> there who know a lesion or rash on the nipple or aureola can be breast
> cancer. Mine started out as a single red pimple on the aureola. One of the
> biggest problems with Paget's disease of the nipple is that the symptoms
> appear to be harmless.  It is frequently thought to be a skin inflammation
> or infection, leading to unfortunate delays in detection and care.
> What are the symptoms? The symptoms include:
> 1. A persistent redness, oozing, and crusting of your nipple causing it
> to itch and burn. (As I stated, mine did not itch or burn much, and had no
> oozing I was aware of, but it did have a crust along the outer edge on one
> side).
> 2. A sore on your nipple that will not heal. (Mine was on the aureola
> area with a whitish thick looking area in center of nipple).
> 3. Usually only one nipple is affected.
>
> How is it diagnosed?
> Your doctor will do a physical exam and should suggest having a mammogram
> of both breasts, done immediately. Even though the redness, oozing and
> crusting closely resemble dermatitis (inflammation of the skin), your
> doctor should suspect cancer if the sore is only on one breast. Your
> doctor should order a biopsy of your sore to confirm what is going on.
> They will take a sample of your breast tissue in that area to test for
> cancer. If the cancer is only in the nipple and not in the breast, your
> doctor may recommend just removing the nipple and surrounding tissue or
> suggest radiation treatments. Had my doctor caught mine right away,
> instead of flaking it off as dermatitis, perhaps they could have saved my
> breast, and it wouldn't have gone to my lymph nodes.
> This message should be taken seriously and passed on to as many of your
> friends as possible; it could save someone's life. My breast cancer has
> spread and metastasized to my bones after receiving mega doses of
> chemotherapy, 28 treatments of radiation and taking tamaxofin. If this had
> been diagnosed as breast cancer in the beginning, perhaps it would not
> have spread...
> TO ALL READERS- This is sad as women are not aware of Paget's disease. If,

> its potential danger, we are helping women everywhere. Please, if you can,

Subject: New Options Model

Meeting on May 30 at 3:30pm regarding the new Option Model we (Steve Wang, 
Harry Arora, and Rob Stalford) use to make markets.  The old structuring 
model was created for marketer to give indicative pricing.  I have created 
this model especially for option market making.  As market makers we found 
the old model too slow as we are often making bid/offers in more than five 
strikes in more than five different months.  This model allows us to make our 
markets quicker and identify mispricings in the market before our 
competitors.  This is not to replace the old structuring model.  It is only a 
complement that will give everyone a better picture of where options are 
trading and where bid/offers are.  We will publish these prices weekly and 
will eventually have them on a daily basis.

either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature o=
f=20
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures fo=
r=20
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The "Best Online Dealer" award i=

	It's Thanksgiving. Put down the turkey. Stop watching football. And learn a 
little about the holiday you're celebrating today at Plimoth.org. If the 
Library section is causing you to read too much, then swing on over to the 
Plantation section and just scroll through some cool pictures. Done? Good - 
you're just in time for some pumpkin pie. www.plimoth.org

	At one time, the turkey and the bald eagle were both considered America's 
national symbol. Benjamin Franklin was pro turkey, and felt it was a better 
choice than the bald eagle, which he felt was "a coward." For more, click

REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook 
client will be configured on your computer.
After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve mail 
via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is 
configured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is 
migrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your 
web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.

PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and 
To-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook 
client is configured on your desktop.

2. Remote access to your mailbox.
After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) 
for remote access to your mailbox.

PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while 
connecting to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA 
available from your home or when traveling abroad.

HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)

Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  
http://nahou-msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

Substitute "john.doe" with your first and last name, then click ENTER.  You 
will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your user 
id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.  You 
will now be able to view your mailbox.

 

PLEASE NOTE:  There are some subtle differences in the functionality between 
the Outlook and OWA clients.  You will not be able to do many of the things 
in OWA that you can do in Outlook.  Below is a brief list of *some* of the 
functions NOT available via OWA:

Features NOT available using OWA:

-  Tasks
-  Journal
-  Spell Checker
-  Offline Use
-  Printing Templates
-  Reminders
-  Timed Delivery
-  Expiration
-  Outlook Rules
-  Voting, Message Flags and Message Recall
-  Sharing Contacts with others
-  Task Delegation
-  Direct Resource Booking
-  Personal Distribution Lists

QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS?

If you have questions or concerns using the OWA client, please contact the 
Outlook 2000 question and answer Mailbox at:

 Outlook.2000@enron.com

Otherwise, you may contact the Resolution Center at:

 713-853-1411

Thank you,

Subject: Stacey's Baby Shower

We are copying an idea presented for Bernice's baby shower for Stacey, but 
with a Holiday flare. Stacey wasn't planning on putting up a Christmas tree 
since she's been having it rather rough here lately. SO, we are doing a 
'Money Tree', or actually, a 'Money Christmas Tree'. Susan & I will be 
purchasing a small artificial Christmas tree & decorating it with baby 
booties and such. Anyone who would like to donate $ rather than purchase a 
gift is welcome to participate. We will be tucking the money into the little 
booties & topping the tree off with a Baby's First Christmas ornament. That 
way, little baby Richardson will have a Christmas Tree, mommy can buy what 
she wants/needs, and the booties can be taken off & worn to keep the 
ittle-bittie baby toes warm in the winter. We will be collecting donations 
thru Thursday afternoon. We will have a card available to sign for those who 
wish to join in.

If you have any questions please call Susan (59989) or Cyndie (31443).

Thanks!!
Cyndie

     THE PERFECT PICTURE
When you THINK you have a bad day, remember this one from a
young mother..."I was taking a shower when my 2-year-old son came
into the bathroom and wrapped himself in toilet paper. "Although he
made a mess, he looked adorable, so I ran for my camera and took
a few shots.  They came out so well that I had copies made and
included one with each of our Christmas cards.
Days later, a relative called about the picture,  laughing hysterically
and suggesting I take a closer look. puzzled, I stared at the photo and
was shocked to discover that in addition to my son, I had captured
my reflection in the mirror-wearing nothing but a camera!"

       MY FOOTSTEPS?
An acquaintance of mine who is a physician told this story about her
then-four-year-old daughter. On the way to preschool, the doctor had
left her stethoscope on the car seat, and her little girl picked it up
and
began playing with it. Be still, my heart, thought my friend, my daughter

wants to follow in my footsteps!
Then the child spoke into the instrument: "Welcome to McDonald's.
May I take your order?"

           WISE CHILD
A certain little girl, when asked her name, would reply, "I'm
Mr.Sugarbrown's daughter." Her mother told her this was wrong, she
must say, "I'm Jane Sugarbrown." The Vicar spoke to her in Sunday
School and said, "Aren't you Mr. Sugarbrown's daughter?"
She replied,  "I thought I was, but mother says I'm not."

        TOO ROUGH
A little girl asked her mother, "Can I go outside and play with the
boys?" Her mother replied, "No, you can't play with the boys, they're
too rough.  The little girl thought about it for a few moments, and
asked, "If I can find a smooth one, can I play with him?"

        THUMB SUCKING
A boy had reached four without giving up the habit of sucking his
thumb, though his mother had tried everything from bribery, to
reasoning to painting it with lemon juice to discourage the habit.
Finally she tried threats, warning her son that, "If you don't stop
sucking your thumb, your stomach is going to blow up like a
balloon." Later that day, walking in the park, mother and son saw
a pregnant woman sitting on a bench. The four-year-old considered
her gravely for a minute, then spoke to her saying, "Uh-oh .. I know
what you've been doing."

        THE LORD'S PRAYER
A mother was teaching her 3-year-old the Lord's prayer.  For several
evenings at bedtime she repeated it after her mother. One night she
said she was ready to solo. The mother listened with pride as she
carefully enunciated each word, right up to the end of the prayer. "Lead
us not into temptation, "she prayed, "but deliver us some e-mail, Amen."

        SO KEEP THE SINGING DOWN, OK?
A Sunday school teacher asked her little children, as they were on the
way to church service, "And why is it necessary to be quiet in church?"
One bright little girl replied, "Because people are sleeping."

         THE PRESSED LEAF
A little boy opened the big and old family Bible. With fascination, he
looked at the old pages as he turned them. Then something fell out
of the Bible and he picked up and looked at it closely. It was an old
leaf from a tree that had been pressed in between the pages. "Momma,
look what I found,"  the boy called out.  "What have you got there,
dear?"
his mother asked.  With astonishment in the young boy' voice he
answered:  "It's  Adam's suit!"
